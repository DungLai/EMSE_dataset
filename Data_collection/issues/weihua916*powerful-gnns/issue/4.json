I would like to apply your algorithm to my task, so I need to create dataset which will fit your code. I have, say, 150 graphs of 200 nodes each, where all the nodes are equal. \r\n</br>\r\nI'm trying to understand your txt files, but have some issues with that.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n10 0\r\n0 3 1 2 9\r\n0 3 0 2 9\r\n0 4 0 1 3 9\r\n0 3 2 4 5\r\n0 3 3 5 6\r\n0 5 3 4 6 7 8\r\n0 4 4 5 7 8\r\n0 3 5 6 8\r\n0 3 5 6 7\r\n1 3 0 1 2\r\n```\r\nMy assumption is that the block correspond to a graph, 10 is a number of nodes while 0 is a graph class label. Each row correspond to a node, where first value is a (node label I guess?), second is a number of links, and other are connections. Is that right? Is row number correspond to the node index?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weihua916/powerful-gnns/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weihua916/powerful-gnns/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
