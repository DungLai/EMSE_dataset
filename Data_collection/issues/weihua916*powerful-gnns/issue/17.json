For example, the MUTAG dataset has 2 classes according to the table (and the actual data labels that I checked, which are either 1 or -1), versus in the appendix it says that the dataset has 7 discrete labels. Was wondering if you could clarify the disagreement. \r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"mdanb","id":37456158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDU2MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37456158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb","html_url":"https://github.com/mdanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weihua916/powerful-gnns/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weihua916/powerful-gnns/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
