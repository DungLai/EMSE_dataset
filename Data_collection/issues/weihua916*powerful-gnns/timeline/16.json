Dropout at the prediction output forces prediction scores of an example to become zero and also scales up the prediction scores of other examples in the batch. Please see: \"Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of \\frac{1}{1-p}\" in https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html\r\nIt would be great if you could help me understand this a bit better.
