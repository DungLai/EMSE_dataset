However, I found something strange. \r\nmy test code is as following:\r\n\r\nfrom fill_depth_colorization import *\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    p1 = 'kitti_raw_data/2011_09_26/2011_09_26_drive_0001_sync/image_02/data/0000000005.png'\r\n    p2 = 'train/2011_09_26_drive_0001_sync/proj_depth/groundtruth/image_02/0000000005.png'\r\n    img1 = np.array(Image.open(p1))\r\n    img2 = np.array(Image.open(p2))\r\n    dense = fill_depth_colorization(img1, img2)\r\n    print((img2.min(), img2.max()), (dense.min(), dense.max()))\r\n\r\noutput: (0, 21733) (1365.0, 21733.0)\r\n\r\nIt seems the minimal value is changed to non-zero (0 to 1365.0) after the inpainting method. I am not sure whether this is normal. \r\nI noticed that you use the reciprocal of the depth, so non-zero is a must?\r\nThank you.","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
