I am planning to finetune the NYUv2 pretrained model on my own kinect dataset. I have a question about the pre-processing done to the depth ground truth data.\r\n\r\n From my understanding, your NYUv2 keras model takes 480x640 images (each pixel a 0-255 uint8 value) as input depth ground truth data(from the ~4 GB nyu-data.zip files). However, your python re-implementation of the depth infilling method gives as output depth values between 0 - 1 float. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if you can let me know how did you exactly convert the 0-1 float to 0-255 uint. Did you directly multiply by 255 and convert to uint8? Or did you something like,\r\n\r\n255*((depth_infilling_output - Min(depth_infilling_output))/max(depth_infilling_output))\r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/44/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/44/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
