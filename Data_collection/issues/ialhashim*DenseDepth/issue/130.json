In particular it seems that only one Leaky Relu layer is used at the end of the upsampling layer for the pretrained kitti, rather than two.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, I had to change\r\n`decode_filters = int(encoder._encoder.layers[-1].output[0].shape[-1] // 2)` to `decode_filters = int(encoder._encoder.layers[-1].output[0].shape[-1])` in order to ensure the ported model output shape was correct.\r\n\r\nHere is the `model.summary()` of the pretrained kitti model.
