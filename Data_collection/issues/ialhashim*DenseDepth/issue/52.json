Is the output equal to the disparity map? For example, if I use the trained model to test a CitySpace picture whose size is 2048x1024. Should I resize the output(1024x512) to 2048x1024 first, and then use the formula : \r\n                         depth = 0.209313 * 2262.52/(2048 * disparity)  \r\nto get the depth map? \r\nThanks for your brilliant work.
