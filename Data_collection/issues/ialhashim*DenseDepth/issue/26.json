The original depth data in KITTI is 16 bit. After division by 256 you get values in meters.\r\n    After running the fill_depth_colorization.py script the max range of the output depth is [0 85].\r\n    What did you do with the zeros? Should I just change them to 0? (This is what I currently do).\r\n   Should I first scale the data to the range [0,255]? (Because this is, as far as I understand, the assumed range in the function NYU_BasicAugmentRGBSequence:\r\n   y = np.clip(np.asarray(Image.open( BytesIO(self.data[sample[1]]) )).reshape(480,640,1)/255*self.maxDepth,0,self.maxDepth)\r\n\r\n2. In NYU_BasicRGBSequence - why do you divide by 10.0 in this line:\r\ny = np.asarray(Image.open(BytesIO(self.data[sample[1]])), dtype=np.float32).reshape(480,640,1).copy().astype(float) / 10.0\r\n\r\nShould I change it to 80.0 for KITTI?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nOfer\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
