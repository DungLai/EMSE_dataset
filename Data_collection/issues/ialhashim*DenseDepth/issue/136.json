And where I can find it ? \r\n\r\nI am very new in this field, and I see lots of paper claims they test on 694/654 frames from 1449 NYU labeled set,  following Eigen split or official split. But I cannot the list of it. \r\n\r\nCould you tell me where this split exactly is ?  A link toward it would be very helpful. \r\n\r\nThanks!
