When I tried your code to infer depth using pre-trained model, everything is fine. But then, I tried to train the network using provided code and dataset. I used the same tensorflow and keras version as stated in the Readme (TF 1.13.2 and Keras 2.2.4). So, firstly I tried to run the training on a very small subset of provided dataset but when saving the model, I got this error. Have you ever got this error? Did I use different TF or Keras version than yours? Thank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nResindra\r\n\r\n`Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 92, in <module>\r\n    basemodel.save(runPath + '/model.h5')\r\n  File \"/home/aresindra/.virtualenvs/tensor113/lib/python3.5/site-packages/keras/engine/network.py\", line 1090, in save\r\n    save_model(self, filepath, overwrite, include_optimizer)\r\n  File \"/home/aresindra/.virtualenvs/tensor113/lib/python3.5/site-packages/keras/engine/saving.py\", line 382, in save_model\r\n    _serialize_model(model, f, include_optimizer)\r\n  File \"/home/aresindra/.virtualenvs/tensor113/lib/python3.5/site-packages/keras/engine/saving.py\", line 84, in _serialize_model\r\n    model_config = json.dumps(model_config, default=get_json_type)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/json/__init__.py\", line 237, in dumps\r\n    **kw).encode(obj)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/json/encoder.py\", line 198, in encode\r\n    chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/json/encoder.py\", line 256, in iterencode\r\n    return _iterencode(o, 0)\r\n  File \"/home/aresindra/.virtualenvs/tensor113/lib/python3.5/site-packages/keras/engine/saving.py\", line 74, in get_json_type\r\n    raise TypeError('Not JSON Serializable: %s' % (obj,))\r\nTypeError: Not JSON Serializable: ?`","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
