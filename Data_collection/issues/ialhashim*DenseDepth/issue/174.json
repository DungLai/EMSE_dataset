I have a question regarding NYUV2 test set that you used to evaluate your model. Is it the same one you provided in this project? and if so how do you account for invalid pixels seen in the original test set of Eigen et al. where they did not consider those pixels for evaluation, and as far as I know most paper reports their results based on that original set with the invalid pixels.
