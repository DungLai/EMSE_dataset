And the latest tensorflow (currently 2.3.0) doesn't work with Ubuntu 20.04's keras. So I installed the latest keras (2.4.3) and the latest tensorflow (2.3.0) with pip3\r\n```\r\n$pip3 install keras tensorflow-gpu\r\n```\r\nThen I got this issue\r\n```\r\n/New/DenseDepth/layers.py\", line 9, in __init__\r\n    self.data_format = K.normalize_data_format(data_format)\r\nAttributeError: module 'keras.backend' has no attribute 'normalize_data_format'\r\n```\r\nI found a solution from Mete Han Kahraman there https://stackoverflow.com/a/53442550\r\nI added the following after import section in layers.py:\r\n```\r\ndef normalize_data_format(value):\r\n    if value is None:\r\n        value = K.image_data_format()\r\n    data_format = value.lower()\r\n    if data_format not in {'channels_first', 'channels_last'}:\r\n        raise ValueError('The `data_format` argument must be one of '\r\n                         '\"channels_first\", \"channels_last\".
