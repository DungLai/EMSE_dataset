This seems to be because even the minimum value of a pixel in the resultant image is well over 255. \r\nThe code I'm using is :\r\n```\r\nimage_depth = np.array(Image.open('D:/kitti/train/2011_09_26_drive_0018_sync/proj_depth/groundtruth/image_02/0000000005.png'))\r\nimage_rgb = np.array(Image.open('D:/2011_09_26/2011_09_26_drive_0018_sync/image_02/data/0000000005.png'))\r\nimage_depth_filled = fill_depth_colorization(imgRgb=image_rgb,imgDepthInput=image_depth,alpha=1)\r\nprint(image_depth.min(), image_depth.max())\r\nprint(image_depth_filled.min(), image_depth_filled.max())\r\n```\r\nAnd when I'm checking the output for both the depth and the filled arrays the minimum value is causing my inpainted image to be as completely white.\r\n\r\n```\r\n0 20211\r\n1532.0 20211.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resultant image I'm getting for the particular image after inpainting:\r\nOriginal\r\n![0000000005](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42406413/95018370-ec979300-067c-11eb-84ff-6c00e159c569.png)\r\nAfter Inpainting\r\n![img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42406413/95018344-ca057a00-067c-11eb-8c58-fa17e0948be4.png)\r\n\r\nAny help with this would be appreciated.
