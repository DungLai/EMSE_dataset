First I resize the images to `W/2 x H/2` and send them into training. During test, I have another image with focal Length F2 and image size `4W x 4H`, I also resize them into  `W/2 x H/2` as training  preprocess does. The predicted output  is `dpred`. So I have two questions: \r\n\r\n1.  for training phase, the resized image have a pesudo-focal length of `F1/2` if the max depth is still regarded as 100m , am I right? \r\n2. for testing on another image, the real depth should be:  `0.5F1  /  0.125F2  == dreal / dpred`ï¼Œ so `dreal = 100 * dpred * (0.5F1  /  0.125F2) `, do I understand it right ? \r\n\r\nThanks so much !
