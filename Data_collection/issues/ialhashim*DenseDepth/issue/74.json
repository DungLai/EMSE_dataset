I have a new question about the predict() as follows:\r\n![predict](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37893834/67260291-55c2dc80-f4e6-11e9-8738-a2e98a980ca0.png)\r\n The 'predictions' is the output of the model, so the loss function is to compute the loss between 'predictions' and 'y_true' ? And the return value 'np.clip(DepthNorm(predictions, maxDepth=1000), minDepth, maxDepth) / maxDepth' is the output of test, not the value to compute loss? Is it right?\r\nThank you again!\r\n\r\nBoni","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
