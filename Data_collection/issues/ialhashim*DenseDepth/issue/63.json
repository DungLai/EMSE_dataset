I wanted to train a densedepth model to check the training accuracy. So I did the following:\r\n1. Cloned the repository\r\n2. Downloaded the NYU dataset mentioned in the readme \"nyu_data.zip\" and placed it inside the repository.\r\n3. Ran command from readme for training `python train.py --data nyu --gpus 4 --bs 8`\r\n\r\nThings start smooth but suddenly I am getting the an error and the training process stops. Following is my output log:\r\n```\r\nUsing TensorFlow backend.\r\nWill use 4 GPUs.\r\nLoading base model (DenseNet)..\r\nWARNINGS.... \r\n\r\nModel created.\r\nOutput: ./models/1569407560-n6336-e20-bs8-lr0.0001-densedepth_nyu\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 60, in <module>\r\n    plot_model(model, to_file=runPath+'/model_plot.svg', show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/keras/utils/vis_utils.py\", line 250, in plot_model\r\n    return display.Image(filename=to_file)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/IPython/core/display.py\", line 1015, in __init__\r\n    raise ValueError(\"Cannot embed the '%s' image format\" % (self.format))\r\nValueError: Cannot embed the 'svg' image format\r\n```\r\n\r\nI researched and it seems to be an IPython related issue with no resolution available online.
