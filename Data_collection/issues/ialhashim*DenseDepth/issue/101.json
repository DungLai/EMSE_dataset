In gt data preparation in **data.py**,   `batch_y = DepthNorm(y_real, maxDepth=self.maxDepth)`, here the y_real is converted into `maxD/ y_real`. \r\n2. In **callbacks.py**  Line 49, `x_train, y_train = x_train[0], np.clip(DepthNorm(y_train[0], maxDepth=1000), minDepth, maxDepth) / maxDepth ` ï¼Œ so the actual \r\n`y_train = maxD / batch_y / maxD = 1/ batch_y = y_real/  maxD`\r\nThis is confusing.  Do I miss anything? I'm not familiar with Keras,  I don't know the reason for using the transform in **callbacks.py**\r\nLooking forward for your reply. Thanks.","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
