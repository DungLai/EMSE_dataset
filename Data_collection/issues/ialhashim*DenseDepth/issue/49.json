I think there might be a small bug in your tensorflow 2.0 dataloader where you shuffle in a wrong place. The way you shuffle makes all epochs the same permutation. I think you need to have a shuffle before/after repeat. \r\n\r\nPS . The shuffle in model.fit wont have any effects as explained in the keras documentation [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)\r\n  \r\nSuggested code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n def get_batched_dataset(self, batch_size):\r\n        self.dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((self.filenames, self.labels))\r\n        self.dataset = self.dataset.shuffle(shuffle_buffer_size=len(self.filenames))\r\n        self.dataset = self.dataset.repeat()\r\n        self.dataset = self.dataset.map(map_func=self._parse_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)\r\n        self.dataset = self.dataset.batch(batch_size=batch_size)\r\n        return dataset\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI was also wondering if pytorch code and tensorflow 2.0 give the same result as keras. Do you have any evaluation on those two codes compared with the original keras?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAli","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
