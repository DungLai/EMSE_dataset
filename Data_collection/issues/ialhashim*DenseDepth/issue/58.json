Firstly, I would like to thank you for releasing your code. It could be a lifesaver for me to learn more about learning-based method.\r\n\r\nI want to ask about maxDepthVal in loss.py's argument input. In the NYU_BasicAugmentRGBSequence it is stated that maxVal is 1000.0 which I believe is 1000 cm. Is it correct? But, for calculation of SSIM, why do you use 1000.0/10.0 as maxDepthVal? I wish that you would like to help me understand this even though this might be just a very simple question. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nResin","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
