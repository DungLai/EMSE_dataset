But I need more information.\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain me what is model output? Is it depth at each pixel in meters? In the following line in utils.py's predict function:\r\n\r\n`predictions = model.predict(images, batch_size=batch_size)`\r\n\r\n ... I see that the model outputs some numbers which are smaller for far objects and larger for near objects. What does this number mean?\r\n\r\nAnd also what is the purpose of the next line (see below)? \r\n`np.clip(DepthNorm(predictions, maxDepth=maxDepth), minDepth, maxDepth) / maxDepth`\r\n\r\nThis line effectively computes reciprocal of the model output and limits the values to 1. This helps in generating the depth map as picture. However I am more interested in getting the actual depth value at each pixel. Is the model prediction good enough for getting actual depth value (say in meters)?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
