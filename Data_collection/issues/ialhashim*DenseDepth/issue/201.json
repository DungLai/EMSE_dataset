I am currently following the TF guide (https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_integer_quant) but when I try to parse the representative_data_gen the memory overflows.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
