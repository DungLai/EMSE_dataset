I used the Kitti.h5 pretrained model to validate the pictures from KITTI datasets.  I use your code in test.py. Should I change the parameters Mindepth and Maxdepth because  I found the default value is 10 and 1000(by the way, does 1000 mean 1000m or 1000cm?), which is set for NYU datasets.  And what function should I use to convert the output to depth map?
