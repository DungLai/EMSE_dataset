This is a part of the code about the loss:\r\n```\r\ndef image_gradients(x):\r\n    l = x\r\n    r = F.pad(x, [0, 1, 0, 0])[:, :, :, 1:]\r\n    t = x\r\n    b = F.pad(x, [0, 0, 0, 1])[:, :, 1:, :]\r\n\r\n    dx, dy = torch.abs(r - l), torch.abs(b - t)\r\n    dx[:, :, :, -1] = 0\r\n    dy[:, :, -1, :] = 0\r\n\r\n    return dx, dy \r\n\r\n\r\n           l_depth = self.l1_criterion(output, targets)\r\n\r\n            ssim_module = SSIM(win_size=11, win_sigma=1.5, data_range=255.0, size_average=True, channel=1)\r\n            l_ssim = torch.clamp(((1 - ssim_module(output, targets)) * 0.5), 0, 1)\r\n\r\n            dy_true, dx_true = image_gradients(targets)\r\n            dy_pred, dx_pred = image_gradients(output)\r\n            l_edges = torch.mean(torch.abs(dy_pred - dy_true) + torch.abs(dx_pred - dx_true), dim=1)\r\n            depth_losses['depth_loss'] = (1.0 * l_ssim) + (0.1 * l_depth) + (1.0 * torch.mean(l_edges))\r\n\r\n```\r\nbut I don't know why the loss is not good, it's unstable (see the image below) when I add the edges loss, I used the function on top (image_gradients) and I compared it with tensorflow implementation of it and it seems they do the same thing. By any chance, do you know why this happen? \r\n\r\n\r\n![photo_2019-12-06_17-54-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55583897/70340657-7d30f700-1851-11ea-810f-64ae520dc7bc.jpg)","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
