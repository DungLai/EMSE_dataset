Thank you for running this project. As mentioned in ReadMe, the raw kitti depth map need to be densify by inpainting method. However, it is extremely slow. I wonder is there any download link for the preprocessed dataset. Besides, I wonder whether the dense depth map is a must for training. Is it possible to train with sparse depth maps?\r\nThank you!
