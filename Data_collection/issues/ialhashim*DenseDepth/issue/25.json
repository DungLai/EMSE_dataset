The maxdepth value seems to be set to 1000 throughout the code, however I noticed that the depth values in the NYU dataset range all the way up to 10000. Should the maxdepth value be changed to 10000 when training NYU?\r\n\r\n2. When making predictions, the predicted depth values can be higher than any values seen in the training set. Do you know why this is so? Do I need to normalize it to the range of the training data as a post processing step?\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, when training NYU I am noticing that the validation loss does not decrease at all, but the training loss does steadily. Any ideas why this might be happening?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
