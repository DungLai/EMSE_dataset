And downgrading h5py module to 2.10.0 loads the model successfully but fit_generator() throws an error while saving the model.\r\n\r\nCan you please detail the environment you are using? Particularly the python version and the h5py module version. Or if possible the complete requirements.txt file? \r\nIt would be really helpful.
