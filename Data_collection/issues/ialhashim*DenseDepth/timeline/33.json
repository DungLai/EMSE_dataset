The trained weights and the best results were trained on the default Keras version.\r\n- I tested the PyTorch by simply creating a new conda environment and simply running `conda install -c pytorch pytorch`. I think at that time it was already PyTorch 1.x.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/509120636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2465236140,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ2NTIzNjE0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2465236140","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-08T07:57:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2465236147,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ2NTIzNjE0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2465236147","actor":{"login":"tlsshh","id":13307387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA3Mzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13307387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh","html_url":"https://github.com/tlsshh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-08T07:57:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2465236149,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NjUyMzYxNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2465236149","actor":{"login":"tlsshh","id":13307387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA3Mzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13307387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh","html_url":"https://github.com/tlsshh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlsshh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-08T07:57:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
