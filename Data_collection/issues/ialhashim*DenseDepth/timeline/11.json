I'll explain the following functions:\r\n- `get_nyu_train_test_data` returns two generators (kind of like an array) such that `train_generator[i]` returns `x, y` representing the RGB input and the ground truth depth maps of shapes `(batch size  x  height  x  width  x  3)` and `(batch size  x  height  x  width  x  1)` respectively.\r\n- You can build on the `NYU_BasicAugmentRGBSequence` class for your own data. The main thing is to have a function `__getitem__` that generates a batch of `x,y` for input RGB and depth.\r\n- Make sure you are correctly specifying the range of depth and that RGB is in [0,1]. Different parts of the code might assume that the maximum depth is 1000 and minimum is 10, so adjust accordingly.\r\n- Always make sure that the images in each batch is random / shuffled before hand.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/474735421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2216049548,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIxNjA0OTU0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2216049548","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-20T08:35:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/474760103","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/11#issuecomment-474760103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/11","id":474760103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDc2MDEwMw==","user":{"login":"boni-hu","id":37893834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODkzODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37893834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu","html_url":"https://github.com/boni-hu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-20T09:52:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T09:52:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK,
