If you apply a modern depth compilation method you might risk attributing your success to such method and therefore need to test all other methods given this new clean data.

However I would be interested to know the extent of such clean data on our performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/496222734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2369514227,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM2OTUxNDIyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2369514227","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T14:00:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
