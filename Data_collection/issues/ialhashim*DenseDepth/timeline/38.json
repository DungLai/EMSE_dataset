If you provide your own image from any source the network will regress something that is closest to the domain it was trained on. It gets less accurate the more you change it from the typical Kinect setup (or KITTI capture setup).\r\n\r\nThis model trains in a supervised manner (you need corresponding pairs of RGB and Depth images). In order to fine-tune the trained model you would have to train the model some more on the new capture device (both RGB and Depth). If you don't have access to that then there is unfortunately no straightforward way to do any calibration. The best you can get is a rough depth estimation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/513531766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2497917793,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ5NzkxNzc5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2497917793","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-21T07:46:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/555370201","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/38#issuecomment-555370201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/38","id":555370201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTM3MDIwMQ==","user":{"login":"shuluoshu","id":17999845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTk5ODQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17999845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu","html_url":"https://github.com/shuluoshu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuluoshu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T07:23:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T07:23:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> The models are trained to output `maxDepth/x` values so we just convert the raw output by again applying `maxDepth/x` giving us values in the range `[0,1]` where 0 is sensor distance and 1 is the maximum distance trained on\r\nhi,  @ialhashim , \r\nI wonder if the real depth is 10cm to 1000cm, `maxDepth/x` is `1~100`, not 0-1,  so does the network output 1-100?
