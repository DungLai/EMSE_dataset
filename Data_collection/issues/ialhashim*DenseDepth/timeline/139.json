@thima2017 \r\n**Big thanks to both of you**\r\n\r\nI struggled a lot to get the GPU working, even thought I could see it through the python command line.  `cupti` from the main channel instead of from the nvidia channel, is what fixed it (but, currently only suspect why)\r\n\r\nI forked the github repo and added a simple install script that create/uses a conda repo.\r\nhttps://github.com/3dsf/DenseDepth\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/691535229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"3dsf","id":44537624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTM3NjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44537624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf","html_url":"https://github.com/3dsf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/3dsf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3759687655,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc1OTY4NzY1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/3759687655","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T19:30:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3759687657,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3NTk2ODc2NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/3759687657","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T19:30:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3759687662,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc1OTY4NzY2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/3759687662","actor":{"login":"thima2017","id":32433505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDMzNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32433505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017","html_url":"https://github.com/thima2017","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thima2017/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-12T19:30:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3759687663,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3NTk2ODc2NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/3759687663","actor":{"login":"thima2017","id":32433505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlc
