this is only needed for the demo (sorry for the messy code there).

So far the best strategy to train the models on a new Linux or Windows machine is to create an environment like so `conda create --name tf_gpu tensorflow-gpu` then install the packages `pip install keras pillow matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-image opencv-python pydot graphviz`.
