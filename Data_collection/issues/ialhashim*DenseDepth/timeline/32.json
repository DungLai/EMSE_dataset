Filling the missing depth values would be better if you intend to use the loss function we defined. Otherwise you may change the loss function to only consider filled values (by masking) and then use `l1` or `l2` metrics.\r\n2. You will need to modify the data loader `data.py` and some small adjustment to ensure visualization and prediction codes are using the right range.\r\n3. Just start with the relevant pre-trained models (NYU or KITTI) and then adjust the data loader to load your data and train.\r\n4. Training from scratch on 1000 will give good training results, but validation an testing on other data depends on the generalization performance of the trained model. If you don't mind using NYU as pre-training you can start your training on the pretrained model. It should help the the model learn faster.\r\n5. Again it depends on your target. For NYU we used which has 50,000 training images it typically needs around 12 to 24 hours to reach the results we show in the paper. Keep in mind that more iterations will result in over-fitting, i.e. worst generalization (real-world) performance.\r\n\r\nIn any case, all answers will be case dependent. Think about what you wan't to achieve and work on that data or testing scenario. In the end all current regression methods are still very low in quality (including ours). So manage your expectations, don't expect great success from the first try.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/507032554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/507508820","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/32#issuecomment-507508820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/32","id":507508820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzUwODgyMA==","user":{"login":"abdur4373","id":46248215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjQ4MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46248215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373","html_url":"https://github.com/abdur4373","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T04:00:06Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T04:00:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank

you for your reply, I want to train your model on my own data set, I have the NYU MATLAB processing toolbox In which format should I save the rgb and depth images and make zip file so that I can feed it directly to your model..... I am bothering you for so small issues ....sorry for that...\r\nThank again ....you are quite helping.... :+1: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/507519062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"abdur4373","id":46248215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjQ4MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46248215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373","html_url":"https://github.com/abdur4373","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/507521114","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/32#issuecomment-507521114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/32","id":507521114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzUyMTExNA==","user":{"login":"abdur4373","id":46248215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjQ4MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46248215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373","html_url":"https://github.com/abdur4373","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdur4373/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T05:14:55Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T05:14:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"And secondly should I change anything for training on almost 5000 images set...like freezing last layers....
