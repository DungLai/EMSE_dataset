let me clarity my situation.\r\n\r\nI am trying to train a model similar to yours using NYU v2 dataset.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent leaking information from final eval data to the model, I splitted the 50k training data randomly into 40k train and 10k validation set. I ended up getting very low loss on both training and validation set. However, the test set performance was terrible. I was suspecting that this is because the training set and validation set contains many similar places, which were recorded in consecutive frames in a sense. \r\n\r\nSo my question is: did you use any specific strategies to divide the training data? I would greatly appreciate if you can share some insights.

What I did was similar to what you did, I also tried the model on additional synthetic data and other datasets and kept modifying it some more. For the final tuning of the hyper parameters I started looking at how the test set for the different datasets is affected. This always shows counter intuitive results when tracking the training and validation set and testing. But what it does help is for finding good learning rate or batch size that do not result in quicker overfitting.\r\n\r\nSo bottom line is try different datasets (e.g. scannet). Or try the larger NYUv2 dataset that would be around 300K images. Tune your model to be least over-fitting then test it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/527763388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
