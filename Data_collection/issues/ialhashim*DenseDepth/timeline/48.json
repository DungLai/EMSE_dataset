It is important to train models on a similar setup as the expected test set (e.g. same camera, subject matter). Otherwise, the performance will be very low when the model is predicting on cases outside the range of images it is trained on (in that case a refinement step can help greatly, provided that the depth information is available).\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, most supervised methods out there (including ours) do not generalize well to unseen data. So do not expect good performance without having large (and relevant) training data.\r\n\r\n(PS: you can try to modify the demo I added to show the point cloud that might help in debugging.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/520324419/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2549321801,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU0OTMyMTgwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2549321801","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T07:35:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/520351980","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/48#issuecomment-520351980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/48","id":520351980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDM1MTk4MA==","user":{"login":"ixtiyoruz","id":24115387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTE1Mzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24115387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz","html_url":"https://github.com/ixtiyoruz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixtiyoruz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T09:16:34Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T09:16:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the answer.
