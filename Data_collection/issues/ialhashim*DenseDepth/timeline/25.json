The depth values are in the range of up to 10 meters max. If its either 1000 or 10000 it won't matter as long as you remain consistent about what the maximum and minimum depths are. If you use a different dataset just make sure the ranges are correct and any computation in the data processing, loss, or visualization is correct.\r\n\r\n2. For regression its expected that values go bellow or over the expected range. However, you do need to clip the values to the ranges of the training data. Any depth value greater than 10 M is not to be taken seriously (its most likely not accurate).\r\n\r\n3. Training loss typically always go down since that is what the optimizer is solving for. Validation loss typically decreases very slowly and in case of over-fitting it might stay the same or go higher. If you train and use the '-full' flag the testing data will be evaluated. You can use that as your 'validation' although its not a real indicator of the model's generalization behavior or its performance in real world cases. One thing to double check is the size of the validation set used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/498362935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2385748264,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM4NTc0ODI2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2385748264","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-03T18:01:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/541471834","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/25#issuecomment-541471834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/25","id":541471834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTQ3MTgzNA==","user":{"login":"boni-hu","id":37893834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODkzODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37893834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu","html_url":"https://github.com/boni-hu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-13T23:55:04Z","updated_at":"2019-10-13T23:56:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi ,\r\n\r\nI have a question about the first question, the depth values of the nyu dataset are between 18 to 255, and the value is between 0.1 to 10 meters in the real world. Can i regards it is just a different Coordinate System. So if i train my own data which have the different depth range of nyu dataset in the real world and i also transformed it to (0,255). Can i still use the max_depth and the min_depth in this code. Because of the great performance with this scale, and then i just transformed the test results from(10,1000) to my own scale. \r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/541471834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"boni-hu","id":37893834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODkzODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37893834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu","html_url":"https://github.com/boni-hu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boni-hu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/541719037","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/25#issuecomment-541719037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/25","id":541719037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTcxOTAzNw==","user":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-14T14:40:14Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T14:40:14Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"For your dataset you only need to make sure that the values do not contain any zeros if you are also going to use `DepthNorm`. Now when it comes to scaling the data it is better to keep your data in their original scale. If the depth camera captured a chair at 3 meters distance the chair needs to stay at 3 meters distance since our model is trained on such cases. We don't know this for sure, but the model could have learned the average height / distance of some objects and that can be some clue to other depth estimations around the scene, again just speculation. If your capture setup is very different than the training data than you don't need to modify the ranges and safely just train on your setup.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, try the different setups and run the training for one or two epochs and then hold some varying validation/test set of your own to see which strategy worked better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/541719037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
