believe this 10 is not for that purpose since all training data is in the range of 10 to 1000 (cm) (before `DepthNorm`). \r\n\r\nThis divide by 10 is only because the test data was saved in a different range unfortunately (got it from another source online). Notice how in the regular data loader we multiply by `maxDepth` after dividing by 255: https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/blob/f376b01820cad7f57222c5a24e40e89577a2c269/data.py#L70","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/533158736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/533166153","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/7#issuecomment-533166153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/7","id":533166153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzE2NjE1Mw==","user":{"login":"resindraburiza","id":14196183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTk2MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14196183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza","html_url":"https://github.com/resindraburiza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/resindraburiza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T14:48:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T14:48:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Aha, I see.
