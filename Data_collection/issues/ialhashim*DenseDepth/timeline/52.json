Actually I want test the transfering ability of the model by test the CitySpace demo using the trained KITTI  model. And now I meet two problems. \r\nFirst when I directly input a CitySpace picture without resizing, the code seems to work well. But when I resize it to (370, 1224, 3) as you mentioned in the reply, it gets erros (ConcatOp : Dimensions of inputs should match: shape[0] = [1,1664,22,76] vs. shape[1] = [1,256,23,76]). \r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the output is around 0.06 ~ 0.49 (without resizing the pircture) So maybe the formula 80 * y has a more reasonable result than 80/y? \r\nThanks agian for writting back.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/525275380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NovaMind-Z","id":42997811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTk3ODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42997811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z","html_url":"https://github.com/NovaMind-Z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NovaMind-Z/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/525276444","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/52#issuecomment-525276444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/52","id":525276444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTI3NjQ0NA==","user":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-27T12:23:44Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T12:23:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"What function are you using to get the depth? the one at `utils.predict` already does the normalization step.
