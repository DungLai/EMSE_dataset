in mind all depth estimations happen now at half the input resolution. This is mainly a hardware decided limitation. If you have a card like the Quadro RTX with 48 GB you might be able to go full resolution. But for now I would advice training such that you get at least batch size of 8 while training. If you crop the method will learn to estimate depth on crops. I am not sure if this is more useful in practice as opposed to upsampling the depth, especially that these CNN based depth estimation methods are not that accurate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/552815556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2790781445,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc5MDc4MTQ0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2790781445","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-12T09:44:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
