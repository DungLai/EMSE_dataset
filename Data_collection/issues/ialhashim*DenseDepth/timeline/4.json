I think several works I mention in the paper are trying to produce better depth estimation using two or more frames, e.g. [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01260) and [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01900), or for small motion maybe use something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTL6f9C_GlU).\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with ConvLTSM. From my experience working on this project it can be very tricky to assume much about what is being learned. The best case is that the current model can be used to predict two or more frames and have another network figure out the correspondence and produce a more spatially and temporally accurate depth map than the individual results. In the worst case, the model is just really good at memorization at the individual frame level, which would be a disappointing conclusion. Looking at the results for the synthetic Unreal test set, its obvious all existing methods, including mine, have a long way to go for better generalization on single frames.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/457197150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2094467713,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA5NDQ2NzcxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2094467713","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-24T13:31:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/457536084","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/4#issuecomment-457536084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/4","id":457536084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzUzNjA4NA==","user":{"login":"mihaibujanca","id":3803777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDM3Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3803777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca","html_url":"https://github.com/mihaibujanca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibujanca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T10:57:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T10:57:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the answer and suggestions!
