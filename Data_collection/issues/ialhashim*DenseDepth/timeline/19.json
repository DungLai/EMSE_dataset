line 70 of the PyTorch train.py file you have only two terms:\r\n> `loss = (1.0 * l_ssim) + (0.1 * l_depth)`\r\n> While in your Keras loss function you have three terms:\r\n> `(w1 * l_ssim) + (w2 * K.mean(l_edges)) + (w3 * K.mean(l_depth))`\r\n\r\nIn my earlier PyTorch implementation I did include the same loss in both. I suspect two issues that might contribute to the performance discrepancy that are hard to debug: (1) the SSIM implementation in PyTorch is not as good as the ones provided by TF (2) Some default parameters used for the different layers (I don't know which) on Keras are set to a good value where as in PyTorch it expects the user to set them. But I am just speculating here, it could be some other issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind the pre-trained models have different performance from the get go (the DenseNet on TF and PyTorch are different).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/492109610/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2339107252,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMzOTEwNzI1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2339107252","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-14T07:17:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2339107254,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMzkxMDcyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/events/2339107254","actor":{"login":"ialhashim","id":2434978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2434978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ialhashim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-14T07:17:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/comments/492276851","html_url":"https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/19#issuecomment-492276851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ialhashim/DenseDepth/issues/19","id":492276851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjI3Njg1MQ==","user":{"login":"tonysy","id":7881589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODE1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7881589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy","html_url":"https://github.com/tonysy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-14T15:03:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T15:03:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ialhashim
