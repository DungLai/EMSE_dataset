In the paper, the formula you mentioned is like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19360686/68131646-4cd60000-ff15-11e9-8c88-2fbb028f2625.png)\r\nAnd where:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19360686/68131674-5a8b8580-ff15-11e9-9149-94efc3966249.png)\r\nwhile in your code, it is like this:\r\n```\r\nwith tf.name_scope(\"in_arcs-%s_name-%s_layer-%d\" % (lbl, name, layer)):\r\n\tinp_in     = tf.tensordot(gcn_in, w_in, axes=[2,0]) + tf.expand_dims(b_in, axis=0)\r\n\tadj_matrix = tf.transpose(adj_mat[lbl], [0,2,1])\r\n\tin_t \t   = self.aggregate(inp_in, adj_matrix)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\tif self.p.dropout != 1.0: in_t    = tf.nn.dropout(in_t, keep_prob=self.p.dropout)\r\n\tif w_gating:\r\n\t\tinp_gin = tf.tensordot(gcn_in, tf.sigmoid(w_gin), axes=[2,0]) + tf.expand_dims(b_gin, axis=0)\r\n\t\tin_act  = self.aggregate(inp_gin, adj_matrix)\r\n\telse:\r\n\t\tin_act   = in_t\r\n```\r\nIt seems to me that the calculated `in_t` or `inp_in` is never used when enable gating which might not align with the formula where there is a multiplication in between. And the weight `w_in` and `w_out` would never be updated in the code. May you please give me some information how the calculated `in_t` or the `w_in` and `w_out`  are used under gating mechanism in your code?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.  \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"svjan5","id":6361575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjE1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6361575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5","html_url":"https://github.com/svjan5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svjan5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
