I have managed to run the code with default setting on given dataset which consists of 57 million sentences on a Titan V, it takes around 18 hours to go over just one epoch(I noticed that your negative samples are set to be 100, wouldn't it be too large?). I wonder would it be possible for you to also release a pre-trained checkpoint and may I also ask your gpu and runtime?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Punchwes","id":19360686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzYwNjg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19360686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes","html_url":"https://github.com/Punchwes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Punchwes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
