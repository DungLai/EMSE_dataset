They do so to avoid overparametrize the model (when adding reversed edges), also I saw that you compute the self loop vector, but you did not include it in the update formulae. \r\n\r\nCould you tell me if I misunderstood the code.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nKindly regards","closed_by":{"login":"atmani-massinissa","id":18259289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU5Mjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18259289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa","html_url":"https://github.com/atmani-massinissa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atmani-massinissa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
