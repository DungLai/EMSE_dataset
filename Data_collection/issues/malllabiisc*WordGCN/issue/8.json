However, after the training finished (and it printed success message), I found nothing in the ./embeddings directory except for syngcn_embeddings.txt, which I put it there as the training set. \r\nIn addition, the log files were output to ./log successfully, and those evaluations in them accord with the data given in the paper. \r\n\r\nI tried several times and it turned out the same.\r\nCould anyone please tell me why this happened?
