(As follows)\r\n`<num_words> <num_dep_rels> tok1 tok2 tok3 ... tokn dep_e1 dep_e2 .... dep_em`\r\nThey are actually organized like this (the first line of the initial data.txt file)\r\n`15 14 15 24351 24351 10 7 436 2083 26 8385 121958 4986 215 13 6932 2293 2 1|0|26 5|1|11 5|2|23 5|3|34 5|4|7 7|6|11 5|7|9 9|8|7 7|9|38 9|10|13 13|11|2 13|12|7 10|13|16 5|14|10 21854 21854 3 15 659 2324 0 2397 0 479 328 4 5905 7965 0`\r\nwhich have 4 parts, the first part '15 14 15' --I guess they are the numbers of the latter three parts? So what does the latter three parts represent?\r\n\r\nI re-read the 'batch_generator.cpp', and it seems the last part of each line (i.e. the sequence of numbers after the dependency relations) are read but not stored.\r\nTherefore, would it work if I set the first three numbers as (number of words in the sentence, number of dependency relations, 0), and leave the last part empty?\r\n\r\nThis problem confuses me for a long time... I tried setting the last part the same as the sentence tokens, and it kept showing segmentation fault... \r\n\r\nWould you please give a description of data.txt, and also update the README.md?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n@svjan5\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"loginaway","id":49507817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTA3ODE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49507817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway","html_url":"https://github.com/loginaway","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loginaway/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/malllabiisc/WordGCN/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
