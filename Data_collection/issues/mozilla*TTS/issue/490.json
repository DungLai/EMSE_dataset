The long one could be successfully synthesized. But the short one not only synthesize the part it should be, but also came after some trembling sound.\r\nI tried to use `pad = 0` or `pad = 1` in batch sentence, but it could not generate silence. Hopefully someone could give me a hint, thanks.","closed_by":{"login":"PPGGG","id":11624203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjI0MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11624203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG","html_url":"https://github.com/PPGGG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PPGGG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
