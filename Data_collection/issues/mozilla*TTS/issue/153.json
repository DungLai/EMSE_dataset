It should work well with the [MOLD WaveRNN](https://github.com/erogol/WaveRNN#released-models) model. \r\n\r\n- Model has been trained for 260K iterations. It has the best validation loss so far on LJSpeech.\r\n\r\n- Model has been trained first with dropout Prenet as in the original paper and then switched to BN prenet described above. And finally, it's been trained with \"forward attention.\" for just experimental reasons. \r\n\r\n- In inference time you can try different attention related parameters and pick the one best fits you. So you can switch on/off forward attention, use \"sigmoid\" or \"softmax\" norm or consider to use attention windowing.  The default settings are given by the model's config.json.\r\n\r\n- I think both WaveRNN and TTS models have more space for finetuning (especially WaveRNN) for better results.\r\n\r\nYou can also read more here #26 ","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
