When I listen to the speech from tensorboard it sounds fine. But when it comes to do inference myself through synthesize.py or JupyterNotebook, resulting speech becomes too slow. I attached few examples.\r\nI tried to change sample rate to lower and upper values - the only thing changes is pitch, while speed remains the same. Tried to change some parameters in config, in utils/syntesize.py and even in audio.py - no success.\r\nPlease help!\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n___\r\nThats what I see when test it:\r\n > Setting up Audio Processor...\r\n | > sample_rate:22050\r\n | > num_mels:80\r\n | > min_level_db:-100\r\n | > frame_shift_ms:12.5\r\n | > frame_length_ms:50\r\n | > ref_level_db:20\r\n | > num_freq:1025\r\n | > power:1.5\r\n | > preemphasis:0.98\r\n | > griffin_lim_iters:60\r\n | > signal_norm:True\r\n | > symmetric_norm:True\r\n | > mel_fmin:0\r\n | > mel_fmax:10500.0\r\n | > max_norm:4.0\r\n | > clip_norm:True\r\n | > do_trim_silence:True\r\n | > n_fft:2048\r\n | > hop_length:275\r\n | > win_length:1100\r\n\r\nSo, that's obviously the parameters from config.json, which I used to train the model. \r\n\r\n[samle_res.zip](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/files/3647717/samle_res.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
