erogol，\r\n\r\nappreciate for your great effort to fix #471  issue on dev branch.\r\nI have pulled the code, and happy to see it is still runing with so many epochs\r\n\r\nmeanwhile I got another issue, after 1405 steps, I tried to synthesize wav with certain sentence from training dataset.\r\nit takes really long time, display the message \"Decoder stopped with max_decoder_steps\", the generated wav file is 58s  long while original wav is just about 2s.  \r\n\r\nsimply look into code:\r\n\r\nit happened at tts/layers/tacotron2.py inference below, it seems inputs.shape[0] always equals to 1 \r\nso the problem is caused by stop_token which seems predicted by stopnet.  please help, thanks a lot~\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n#print(f\"----
