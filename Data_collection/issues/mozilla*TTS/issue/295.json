Thanks for your contribution. \r\n\r\nI'm concerned this codebase could be used in a number of bad ways:\r\n\r\n- This could be used for identity fraud. For example, TTS could have already been used to con someone out of money: https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402\r\n- This could be used to fake political videos that could harm the democratic process and create a lot of confusion. This could potentially harm a presidential candidate.\r\n- This could be used in a court of law to argue that the audio evidence is fake. For example, In a murder case the murderer could argue that the recording from the crime was generated by TTS; therefore, it cannot be used to convict.\r\n\r\nBefore this effort continues, there should be some ethical consideration that this work won't be used to harm another person, undermine government systems, and undermine the legal system.\r\n\r\n**The implications are large; therefore, it's important that there is serious thought put into the ethics of this open-source project. I'd recommend we invite and get advice from ethics experts to be safe.**","closed_by":{"login":"reuben","id":477142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzE0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/477142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben","html_url":"https://github.com/reuben","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuben/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/295/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
