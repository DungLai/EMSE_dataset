One downside is it keeps going into something that I call stroke mode. It starts the sentence out well but starts slurring its words, and eventually speaks absolute gibberish while gasping for air. I am assuming the gasping that I am interpreting is from the models understanding that the person needs to breathe occasionally.  The slurring/gibberish seems to happen when the model comes across something that it didn't expect, maybe a different sentence structure or improper formatting of the pasted text. Regardless, whenever it gets tripped up it can not recover. I didn't look at the model/know specifics of language models in general but I am wondering if this might speak to a problem with a regularizer? I feel like their might be a weight that gets maxed out and outshines everything else.
