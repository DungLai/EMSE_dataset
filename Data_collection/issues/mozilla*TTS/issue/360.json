I thought that I would LJSpeech it, so I transcribed it, split it in sentences, threw away all silences and did the metadata.csv. I can confirm it works, however I cannot get it to be applied to the Mozilla code, because it throws the error\r\n`librosa.util.exceptions.ParameterError: Invalid shape for monophonic audio: ndim=2, shape=(28666, 2)`\r\n\r\nI tried both with Pydub and ffmpeg to turn the the sample size to 16 and the sample_rate to 22050, and the number of channels to 2, which matches the LJSpeech attributes, however it just isn't working. I am on the master branch. Would anyone have any tips? Also, isn't it 2?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
