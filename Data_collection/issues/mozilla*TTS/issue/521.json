It can interrupts in the middle of a sentence. Here is an example of such sentence:\r\n\r\n> It was a miracle, how much ease with wildness was managed in such a small space.\r\n\r\nThe encoder produces spectrogram only for \"It was a miracle\" part of the sentence and then interrupts. However, if you remove the comma, it will encode the whole sentence.\r\n\r\nI reproduced this bug with the notebook [DDC_TTS_and_MultiBand_MelGAN_Example.ipynb](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/blob/master/notebooks/DDC_TTS_and_MultiBand_MelGAN_Example.ipynb) from current master.","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
