But none of them gave me a clue.\r\nSo, I decided to create this issue. Although it is a question and asking questions is discouraged here, however, this is more than a simple question, actually it is a very fundemantal problem.\r\nI used to do TTS with a traditional GMM framework. Recently we decided to go with TTS with DNN, and I found Tacotron and then finally Tacotron2, so I ended up here.\r\nNaturally I want to estimate an approximate time for a given set of audio files for traning. \r\nI see that there are bunch of parameters in config.json and all those differs accordign to the my input training set. \r\nHowever, I believe that there must be a way to approximately estimate how much time it will take for training.\r\nFor example in my case, I started with a very small amount of audio data, 180 audios of between 10 sec and 20 seconds, total length of the audios is about 43 minutes. I know that is too few,\r\nbut I wanted to test the training with a small amount at first to  be able to estimate the amount of time for training for larger datasets.\r\nCan anyone please give me some hints about how to make an estimation ?\r\nI use mostly the default configs.\r\nI use 1 K80 GPU.\r\n180 files    10 sec <= audio length <= 20sec\r\nTotal length 43 minutes\r\nLanguage = Turkish\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your guidance and recommendations as well.\r\nBest Regards\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
