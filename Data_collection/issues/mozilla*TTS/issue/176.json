Along the way I was about to do some small refactorings, especially on the extract features script. \r\n\r\nThen I noticed it had some bugs, and was wondering what parts of the caching are still being used and relevant? If so I would fix and refactor it, otherwise we could drop some parts and simplify things. Here are the lines in question:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/TTS/blob/2e8446539fef72a4bcaa8e3e6a19283a23c186be/extract_features.py#L65-L80\r\n\r\nboth options `args.only_mel` and `args.process_audio` are problematic. \r\n\r\n1. `args.only_mel` leads to no linear spectrogram being produced. But the dataset always assumes the linear spectrogram being on third position if it is dealing with a cached item ...\r\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/TTS/blob/2e8446539fef72a4bcaa8e3e6a19283a23c186be/datasets/TTSDataset.py#L116-L127\r\nso with `args.only_mel` true it would try to load the len of the wav array as a file...\r\n\r\n2. `args.process_audio` deletes `output[0]` which is the text, and then inserts the .npy file at position 1. So the resulting output array would look like `[/path/to/wav, /path/to/npy, ....]` with the text gone.\r\n\r\nWhat parts of the caching are still relevant? And does it come with a significant speed increase overall?","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
