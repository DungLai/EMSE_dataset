I'm trying training Tacotron2 with a custom dataset and generally it runs well but still with some issues that I failed to resolve. It would be kind if you could give me some ideas about them.\r\nThe nearest problem I got yesterday is when I tried to finetune my model with BN version prenet as mentioned by @erogol in other comment. But with distributed training launched by 'python3.7 distribute.py --restore_path xxxx/best_model.pth.tar', I soon got cuda memory error while found the GPU situation showed below. If I understand well, the main GPU device 0 has been used by all the other 7 subprocess and ran out of memeory while the other 7 still had free memories. I did some search and this probably relates to the restore of Adam optimizer since someone comment that Adam has to restore all parameters only from main GPU device? Any idear about this?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33118185/69768025-e1045180-11b9-11ea-868b-f4619c9aae44.png)\r\nOther doubts are about some training details that I posted here https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/58#issuecomment-558895309\r\nI woud be grateful if you could share some ideas with me, thanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
