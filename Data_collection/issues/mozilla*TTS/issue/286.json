I was getting some warnings and mentioned them in this issue: https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/282\r\n\r\nErogol's respond was \"Nan is about the multi GPU training. Since there is padding in sequences, when you distribute them on GPUs, some GPUs might have only the padded part. So they produce NaN gradients.\"\r\n\r\nI have also received NaN warning with a single GPU and I believe attention got better over the time as I started to hear meaningful words instead of random noises however those meaningful words are always the same things repeating itself over and over.\r\n\r\nAs an example I copy pasted this sentence for synthesis \"Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi Lideri Devlet Bahçeli hastaneye kaldırıldı. Bahçeli'nin sağlık durumu hakkında henüz resmi bir açıklama gelmezken rutin kontroller nedeniyle hastaneye gittiği öğrenildi.\" however the sentence I heard back was \"Kıbrıs harekatının düzenlenmesi ile ilgili...\" and some silence afterwards.\r\n\r\nSynthesized sentences are always 12 seconds long and even on the synthesis page I'm getting \"Decoder stopped with 'max_decoder_steps\"\" and I believe it's something related to that.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm around 82000+ global steps. Here are some images for better understanding of the situation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"753\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414077-95b97580-ddfb-11e9-98e5-aa8e73e67a32.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"862\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414148-c26d8d00-ddfb-11e9-94b4-4b241b68896e.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"748\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414323-23956080-ddfc-11e9-9e13-c5baf706d49a.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"759\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414355-3445d680-ddfc-11e9-9dd6-b384ba12b895.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"778\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414381-3e67d500-ddfc-11e9-81c7-49119acd595f.png\">\r\n\r\nEval audio also gives a sentence which is clearly synthesized from my voice and it's a meaningful and different sentence, however test audios are completely random and garbage. 0-audio being the \"Kıbrıs\" one.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"766\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414483-80911680-ddfc-11e9-901c-8260de0a67ff.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414574-b2a27880-ddfc-11e9-8175-d4e108802a56.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"760\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22964050/65414594-bcc47700-ddfc-11e9-916e-13ee16daae0b.png\">\r\n\r\nMy question is what went wrong here?
