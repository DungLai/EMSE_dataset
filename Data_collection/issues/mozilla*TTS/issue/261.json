So I'm using Mozilla TTS as a lib, I need to import it in my app. Right now I'm installing using:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install --no-dependencies \"git+git://github.com/mozilla/TTS.git@2b970c5eefcf6fd0a9a8a8f165734849bfc1838a\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the project isn't made to be packaged, so I end up having Mozilla TTS root folders in my \"site-packages\" like: \"models\", \"utils\", \"tests\". Which is very wrong. By chance it works, since there are no name clash, but it means I cannot have a \"utils\" file in my app else Python gets confused.\r\n\r\nMy current usage is: `from models.tacotron import Tacotron`, but should be `from mozilla_tts.models.tacotron import Tacotron`\r\n\r\nIs there another way of doing this? I am willing to make a PR to fix that, but I'll probably have to move everything in a mozilla_tts folder, regarding setup.py guidelines. Also this will be a pain to backport to every branch.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
