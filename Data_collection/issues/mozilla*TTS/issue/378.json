This, however, seems to have some limitations:\r\n\r\n- The embeddings extracted are sentence-specific, so I am guessing they are merely the spectograms of each sentence. So not actually speaker embeddings. I thought I could solve this by maybe getting the mean of all the embedding vectors extracted from one speaker and get the average in the latent space.\r\n\r\n- I cannot seem to plug-in these embeddings in single-speaker models during inference time or training time, in order to manipulate the voice quality. In theory, what I want to do is see if I can get the mean of, say, 3 different speakers' embeddings and feed the mean output to the synthesizer and see if the voice changes in any way.\r\n\r\nIf I train a single-speaker model using the multi-speaker flag in the config.file, I get the .json file during training time, which only has the integers assigned to the speakers (in this case, just 0, since it is one speaker). But, there is no way to play with these embeddings.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is, I guess: how do I go about changing the voice of a speaker using the embeddings?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"george-roussos","id":25833833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODMzODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25833833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos","html_url":"https://github.com/george-roussos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
