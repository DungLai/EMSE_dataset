I really want the start and stop time of each phoneme of each word. I'm wondering if this is something that is already part of the library, and if it's not I was wondering if anyone knew what part of the library I should modify to calculate these timings.\r\n\r\nI know I could use an acoustic model to calculate this, but this is overkill, and I thought it would be better to find a solution that's already in the TTS library.\r\n\r\nSome context: I want to animate a face / mouth to speak while the synthesized audio is playing. In order to do this I need the start and stop time of each phoneme in the synthesized speech.\r\n\r\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJosh","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/188/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
