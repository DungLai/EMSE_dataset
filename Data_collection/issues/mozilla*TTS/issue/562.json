Their implementation is here https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan. I tried it myself and compared to all MelGAN variants and PWGAN, HiFiGAN gave me the best results. Samples can be found here https://jik876.github.io/hifi-gan-demo/. The only part where it does not sound good is when the speaker breathes, which is something I have faced as an issue in all MelGAN implementations. I think it would be a great addition to the TTS repo and with @erogol's knowledge maybe the results could be even better.\r\n\r\nMe and @Edresson made some changes to the code to adjust it to Mozilla TTS spectrograms and the fork is here https://github.com/george-roussos/hifi-gan. The code is not very efficient yet, but it works and in case there is interest, it should be good starting ground. Also, if there is interest and a need of more hands, I can look into it myself and send a PR. But I don't know when I would have the time. I also want to train a universal HiFiGAN using LibriTTS.","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/562/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/562/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
