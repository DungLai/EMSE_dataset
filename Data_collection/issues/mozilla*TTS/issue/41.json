Assuming it to be enough I ran `python train.py --config_path config.json` by modifying the config file according to my own computer. \r\n\r\nFirst it complained about missing `metadata_train.csv` and then about missing `metadata_val.csv` . \r\n\r\nIn the readme, there is no mention whether I need to run anything else to do preprocessing. So maybe something I am missing. \r\n\r\nTo try to fix, I copied metadata.csv into `metadata_train.csv` and `metadata_val.csv`  files and gave it a run and got following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n > Git Hash: 186a81c\r\n > Experiment folder: /Users/manish/Work/TTS/experiments/July-11-2018_04:51PM-best-model-186a81c\r\n > Reading LJSpeech from - /Users/manish/Downloads/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs\r\n | > Number of instances : 13100\r\n | > Max length sequence 187\r\n | > Min length sequence 5\r\n | > Avg length sequence 98.34648854961831\r\n | > 0 instances are ignored by min_seq_len (0)\r\n > Reading LJSpeech from - /Users/manish/Downloads/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs\r\n | > Number of instances : 13100\r\n | > Max length sequence 187\r\n | > Min length sequence 5\r\n | > Avg length sequence 98.34648854961831\r\n | > 0 instances are ignored by min_seq_len (0)\r\n | > Number of characters : 149\r\n\r\n > Starting a new training\r\n | > Model has 7385090 parameters\r\n | > Epoch 0/1000\r\n !
