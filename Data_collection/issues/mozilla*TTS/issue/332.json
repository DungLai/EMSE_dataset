I tried to train my own universal WavRNN, but cannot get it to generate quality samples. I used the config file that is provided here: https://github.com/erogol/WaveRNN\r\n\r\nHowever, here https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/221#issuecomment-507635545 I can download a trained model and peek at the configuration.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case, the aux_net and upsamling net from Fatchord is used. In the former case, these augmentations are not used. \r\n\r\nHere is my question: Is it possible to train a universal WavRNN without the upsampling and auxiliary networks?","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
