It enables you to train the model by changing the prediction frame size by only fine-tuning the output layer of the network without any architectural change. It is also a solution for #50 \r\n\r\n- Embedding layers to initialize decoder hidden states. \r\n\r\n- Phoneme-based training for faster convergence and robust results.\r\n\r\n- Model prediction frame size is 2 (r=2), leading to better voice synthesis and spectrogram reconstruction. It's a better candidate to cooperate with a neural vocoder.\r\n\r\n- No explicit weighting for lower frequency part of the spectrograms.\r\n\r\n- This model is trained with r=5 for 120K iterations and then continued to train until 185K iterations.\r\n\r\nThis model is a checkpoint from 185K iteration. It might reach better results through longer training. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
