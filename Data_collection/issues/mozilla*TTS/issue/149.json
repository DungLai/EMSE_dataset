Thank you for your response on my previous issues. I really appreciate it. Im progressing very much due to your response. I got few more to ask. \r\n\r\nI'm running your codes on NVIDIA GEFORCE 940MX with 32 batch size-  (**_No. of GPU: 1_**).\r\nUbuntu 18.04, CUDA version 10.1.\r\n\r\nHowever, during the **_0/1000 epoch_**,  I was getting the error as stated below:\r\n\r\n**`**`cuda out of memory. tried to allocate 78.88 mib (gpu 0; 3.95 gib total capacity; 2.99 gib already allocated; 74.44 mib free; 557.82 mib cached)`**`**\r\n\r\nI add the below modification on the **train.py**:\r\n- **_setting up Variable(volatile=true) on the input variable_**\r\n\r\nBut the same error occur.\r\n\r\nMy question is:\r\n\r\n1. Why is that happening ?\r\n2. How exactly i'm going to overcome such Runtime erorr ?\r\n3. I reduce the batch size from 32bs to 16bs. It work but i only observed until 3/1000 epoch then \r\n    I stop. Assuming that it will go well for the next epoch until 1000th.\r\n    But is it good to reduce the batch size ?\r\n4. As stated on the config.json file - **_Lower values than 32 might cause hard to learn attention_**.\r\n  What is it mean by **cause hard to learn attention** ? and what is **learn attention** ?\r\n5. Do I really need to run the training with **_1000 epoch_** ? \r\n    What will happen when i run less than **1000 epoch** ?\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n6. Why can't I initialize my CUDA GPU while I'm on WSL environment? \r\n    Can't even install the NVIDIA driver.","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
