It produces good examples with robust attention alignment without any inference time tricks. You can even hear breathing effects with this model in between pauses.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this TTS model with PWGAN or WaveRNN vocoders. PWGAn provides real-time voice synthesis and WaveRNN is slower but provides better quality.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/erogol/ParallelWaveGAN\r\nhttps://github.com/erogol/WaveRNN\r\n\r\n\r\n(Ignore the small jiggle on the figures caused by TB)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1402048/75243910-1295b480-57cb-11ea-83dc-56580ecd5fa1.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1402048/75243969-2c36fc00-57cb-11ea-955f-9fbcef7f22eb.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/346/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
