Use this projected specs to train WaveRNN. \r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nSo far, I am able to make things work with WaveRNN + mulaw and Tacotron. However, it is lower in quality than Tacotron2. Tacotron needs a finer way to generate mel-spectrograms. It is emprically ~2 times worse (loss values) than Tacotron2 in mel-spec syntehsis.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nIf you train WaveRNN by combining GT and Tacotron's spectrograms, the final result is on par with Tacotron2.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/212/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
