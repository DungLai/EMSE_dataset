I am trying to train my TTS using these values and I am getting a lot of pronunciation and alignment issues that I never get with a win_length of 1100 and a hop_length of 275 (which is what the Taco2 paper suggets also). Maybe 256 and 1024 is better, but I am training with the exact same configuration I trained before and with which I got an extremely robust attention and now my speaker emphasizes words it should not and also skips words. The only things I changed were the audio processing values and that I computed mean-var stats. Would it be worth it to start training with 275 and 1100 instead? The paper also suggests a smaller hop length also gave them pronunciation issues.\r\n\r\nI am training on dev.","closed_by":{"login":"george-roussos","id":25833833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODMzODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25833833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos","html_url":"https://github.com/george-roussos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
