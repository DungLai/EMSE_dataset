Putting example config files under the config folder is hard to maintain and looks complicated for people to start using TTS. \r\n\r\nSo I want to discuss here some of the better alternatives and ask for the wisdom of the crowd üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë.\r\n\r\nCouple of constraints we need to consider from the top of my head.\r\n\r\n- configs should not be python specific and they should be in a generic form to be serialized and loaded by other systems and programming languages. So if someone likes to export the model and use it in an embedded system config file should not be a problem. \r\n- configs should allow easy experimentation, collaboration, and reproduction. \r\n- Each model should explain its config fields. Right now I do this in ```config.json``` by violating the json format with comments. It is no optimal ‚òπÔ∏è.\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea please share it below and let's discuss it. \r\n\r\n**Edit:** \r\n\r\nI should also add one more constraint.\r\n-  We should solve this with no dependencies if possible. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/660/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
