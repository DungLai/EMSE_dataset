I cloned the repo and checked out the commit of the current model.\r\n\r\nI have tested every model it on my machine, in a virtual machine with a fresh install and in a docker container.\r\n\r\nThe models were the one in the server readme (with the server branche checked out), from the released models wiki page (Tacotron2-iter-260K, with commit 824c091) and I tried a build version from https://github.com/iGoog/TTSbuild\r\n\r\nIt was not always working out of box, but I managed to get the same error on every platform with every model I tried.\r\n\r\nI even tried the old and new version of nvidia-docker, but always the same error.\r\n\r\nWhen I download the model I changed the server/server.conf, to match the models and config path (inside and out of docker).\r\n\r\nWhen I run the server/server.py the error occurs\r\n\r\n```Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"server/server.py\", line 3, in <module>\r\n    from synthesizer import Synthesizer\r\n  File \"/srv/app/server/synthesizer.py\", line 12, in <module>\r\n    from matplotlib import pylab as plt\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/pylab.py\", line 257, in <module>\r\n    from matplotlib import cbook, mlab, pyplot as plt\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 29, in <module>\r\n    import matplotlib.colorbar\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/colorbar.py\", line 36, in <module>\r\n    import matplotlib.contour as contour\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/contour.py\", line 23, in <module>\r\n    import matplotlib.text as text\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/text.py\", line 33, in <module>\r\n    from matplotlib.backend_bases import RendererBase\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/backend_bases.py\", line 63, in <module>\r\n    import matplotlib.textpath as textpath\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/textpath.py\", line 20, in <module>\r\n    from matplotlib.mathtext import MathTextParser\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/mathtext.py\", line 43, in <module>\r\n    [int(x) for x in pyparsing.__version__.split('.')] < [2, 0, 0]):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/mathtext.py\", line 43, in <listcomp>\r\n    [int(x) for x in pyparsing.__version__.split('.')] < [2, 0, 0]):\r\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2a1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I have no idea on how to move forward after this error, I am thankfull for every bit of help I can get.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
