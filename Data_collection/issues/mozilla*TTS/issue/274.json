I'm also running this ona vps, so i had to do some ssh port forwarding to get this to work.\r\nAdditionally, when i started the training with phonemes hoping that adjusting the frequence(hz) parameter along with the others regarding the paths would be enough, after 4000 steps i got testing files that where just some wite noise and something else, sadly I don't know how to include the files in the issue, if you're interested I can share something like a onedrive link or such.\r\nCan someone please give me directions on how to proceed about dataset hiperparams?\r\nOh and, if this is of any relevance, i have merged all the wave files for the books in one folder and created an unique metadata.csv, avoiding having to use the m-ailabs loader and used the simpler ljspeech one instead, but as this is just data loading and doesn't have any inference regarding the hiperparams, don't know if it makes any difference.\r\nThanks for your time, have a good day!","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
