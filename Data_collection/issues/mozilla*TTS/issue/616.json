I've got everything working and running without any errors but It seems to not be able to produce any actual audio. \r\n\r\nThe output of the code is posted below:\r\n![Output Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23108204/104157048-59c36e80-53b8-11eb-91e4-b14bb5ed2bd7.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I am not getting any actual errors but it still does not seem to want to produce any audio so I am here seeking help in which any help is appreciated. I'm sorry in advance and truly understand if there might be a quick and subtle solution to this or if this may seem stupid in any way to even why I'm doing this but there is a method to the madness. So, any advice and input is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
