If you have already migrated off it, you can close and ignore this issue.\n\nTravis CI is ending free builds on public repositories. travis-ci.com [stopped providing](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing)them in early November, and travis-ci.org [will stop](https://mailchi.mp/3d439eeb1098/travis-ciorg-is-moving-to-travis-cicom) after December 31, 2020. To avoid disruptions to your workflows, you must migrate to another CI service.\n\nFor production use cases, we recommend switching to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). This service is already widely used within Mozilla. There is a guide to migrating from Travis CI to CircleCI available [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/migrating-from-travis/).\n\nFor non production use cases, we recommend either CircleCI or [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). There is a guide to migrating from Travis CI to Github Actions available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/migrating-from-travis-ci-to-github-actions). Github Actions usage within Mozilla is new, and you will have to work with our github administrators to enable specific actions following [this process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub#How_do_I_hook_up_a_new_GitHub_Actions_or_3rd_party_application_to_a_repository_in_the_mozilla_org.3F).\n\nIf you have any questions, reach out in `#github-admin:mozilla.org` on [matrix](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#github-admin:mozilla.org).\n","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
