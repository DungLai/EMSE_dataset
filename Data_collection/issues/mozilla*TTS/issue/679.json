Consequently, we lose the data unless we manually edit the file.","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/679/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
