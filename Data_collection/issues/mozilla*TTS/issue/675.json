The model would have alredy converged to something useful with the original attention method.\r\n\r\nThe Graves attention looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9463816/109663117-6a03f880-7b74-11eb-9eb1-9e7a309906b2.png)\r\n\r\nand the DCA attention looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9463816/109663182-7ee08c00-7b74-11eb-8b77-9fe59935fc97.png)\r\n\r\nWhat could be the possible cause of this?
