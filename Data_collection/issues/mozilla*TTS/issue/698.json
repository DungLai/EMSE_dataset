It looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19559859/115934162-ae36b980-a490-11eb-830f-a33c70ea5d99.png)\r\n\r\nIn both of the subfolders of tts/, we find the model. But additionally, in each of them, there is another subfolder with the same name that also contains the model. Model files have the same hash. This leads to double the memory consumption.\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\n1) Install on Windows\r\n2) Command line: tts --text \"Guten Tag\" --model_name tts_models/de/thorsten/tacotron2-DCA --vocoder_name vocoder_models/de/thorsten/wavegrad --out_path Desktop/test.wav\r\n3) Open explorer, go to tts directory, in my case C:\\Users\\userName\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.8_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\Local\\tts\\\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"deklesen","id":19559859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTU5ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19559859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen","html_url":"https://github.com/deklesen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deklesen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
