The first one is Centos 6.11 \r\n2. The second one is Virtual Machine Ubuntu 18.4 (host is Windows 10)\r\n\r\nIn both machines I have installed Python 3.8.10. When I execute one English sentence using the own tts models I got an very robotic voice. But when I execute the following sentence:\r\n\r\ntts –text “Este es un ejemplo en castellano”\r\n--config_path config.json\r\n--model_path best_model.pth.tar\r\n--out_path OUTPUT/ejemplo.wav\r\n--vocoder_path vocoder_model.pth.tar\r\n--vocoder_config_path config_vocoder.json\r\n\r\nI am using my own model (that I got by training) I have the following warning message:\r\n\r\n**[W NNPACK.cpp:79] Could not initialize NNPACK!
