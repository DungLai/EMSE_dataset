The only issue is that for some text inputs, the inference process outputs just noise. For example ,\r\n\r\n[mozilla_test.zip](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/files/4029594/mozilla_test.zip)\r\n\r\nI have have shared two sample texts and their corresponding synthesis results:\r\n\r\n\"the number is 345670\" -> synthesis is good\r\n\r\n\"345670\" -> noise\r\n\r\nIt seems there is no problem with phoneme expansion and phoneme to sequence conversion.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
