I did convert it to onnx, thought I couldn't convert the onnx model to TensorRT after all due to some errors.\r\n2. I can only do tracing with torch.jit, but is works, obviously, for the same input length. I gave up changing the code for jit.script, even to script only the Decoder. No success so far.\r\nI read on the Nvidia's Tacotron2 repo, they say it must be not hard to export in jit.script. \r\nDid anyone successfully converted the model to jit.script? Maybe to onnx?\r\nIf so, please, give some hints!!\r\n@ergol, any plans for special branch maybe for jit/onnx?\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
