Why this kind of behavior happen, any idea? Is this could be a bug or my trained dataset does not have a good wide coverage of texts inputs therefore model being not generalized enough to synthesize audio?\r\n\r\nMaybe this could help in understanding the problem. I tried running larger texts and shorter texts. With larger texts it is generating empty audio and for shorter texts like \"**uno**\" it is generating 2 second audio and for shorter texts like \"**uno?**\" with just addition of question mark, it is generating audio of 7 seconds long.\r\n\r\nI am using Griffin Lim as default while synthesizing audio.","closed_by":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
