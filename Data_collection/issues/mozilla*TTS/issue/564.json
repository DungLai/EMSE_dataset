I split it as 16 bit PCM Mono wav sample rate 22Khz at intervals of 3-8 seconds. (I tried to create a dataset like LjSpeech.)\r\nI know I need to change the config.json file for the training.

Could you please help about it?\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the sentence \"If you use phonemes for training and your language is supported here, you don't need to do that.\" I think that Espeak has Turkish support, I think I can use Phonems from here, but I could not find how to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n// PHONEMES\r\n\r\n\"phoneme_cache_path\": \"/home/erogol/Models/phoneme_cache/\", // phoneme computation is slow, therefore, it caches results in the given folder.\r\n\"use_phonemes\": true, // use phonemes instead of raw characters.
