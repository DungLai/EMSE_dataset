There is also some pronunciation defaults on nasal fricatives, certainly because missing phonemes (ɑ̃, ɛ̃) like in _**œ̃n ɔ̃ɡl də ma tɑ̃t ɛt ɛ̃kaʁne** (Un ongle de ma tante est incarné.)_\r\n\r\nI started to train _**text2feat**_, from scratch on French corpus (MAI_ezwa) but after 10k to 15k the loss increase drastically and the result is not so bad with your vocoder, but you told that you trained the model only for 100k steps, 10 times as I do. How can I arrive to 100k steps and more. \r\n\r\nI join the config file.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n> > If I understand well:\r\n> > \r\n> > * it will transform the text to ASCII -> what seems to be an issue for french because then there will be no différence between e, é and (è, ế or ë)\r\n> > * the abreviation, symbols will be transform into the english one rather than the french one...\r\n> > \r\n> > Am I misundertsanding something?\r\n> \r\n> I did the implementation of `french_cleaners` myslef:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> def french_cleaners(text):\r\n>     '''Pipeline for French text.
