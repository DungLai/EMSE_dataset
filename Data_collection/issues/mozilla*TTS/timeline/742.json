have successfully solved this problem in win11 environment. It needs to use `espeak ng` instead of `espeak`. My environment variables are as follows:\r\n\r\n`PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_LIBRARY:C:\\Program Files\\eSpeak NG\\libespeak-ng.dll`\r\n`PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_PATH:C:\\Program Files\\eSpeak NG\\espeak-ng.exe`\r\n\r\nBut I found that I need to restart the computer to make the environment variables take effect. I don't know whether this is a problem of computer principle or OS For the problem of environ loading, I remember that when configuring Java environment variables, the configuration will take effect immediately. Why set this `PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_PATH:C:\\Program Files\\eSpeak NG\\espeak-ng.exe`  cannot take effect immediately.\r\n\r\nI hope to get help.
