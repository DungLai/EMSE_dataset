I think the multiple disciminators did it. The one thing HiFiGAN was better at (at least for my dataset) was the lower frequencies when the speaker glottalised. It is the only vocoder so far that was able to model it naturally. I had problems otherwise with every GAN and WaveGrad, even. Also, I agree with you about MultiBand MelGAN. If you think that a combination may work better, it is worth to try. Also, what do you think about PWGAN generator (since it is WaveNet inspired) and the multiple discriminators?\r\n\r\nThe way that I did training was what suggested on paper. First I trained on raw spectrograms for 1M steps and then finetuned using GTA extracted using my
