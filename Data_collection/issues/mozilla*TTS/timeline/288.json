In my dataset I have same speed everywhere in samples, while output sample is around 1.5 speed of the training one. What can cause that?\r\n\r\nOne more thing. After update I had to add following line to the synthesize.py: \r\n    _if ap_vocoder != None:\r\n        postnet_output = ap_vocoder._normalize(postnet_output)_\r\nsince it is equal to None when we use no external vocoder, and later on it cause reasonable error (None object has no attribute '_normalize')\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/535878111/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vcjob","id":51916323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTE2MzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51916323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob","html_url":"https://github.com/vcjob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2668303916,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjY2ODMwMzkxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/2668303916","actor":{"login":"vcjob","id":51916323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTE2MzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51916323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob","html_url":"https://github.com/vcjob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcjob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-27T11:18:54Z","rename":{"from":"Syntethized
