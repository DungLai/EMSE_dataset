problem! It is single speaker, so it isn't exchangeable. And I cannot share samples unfortunately because the speaker only gave me permissions for testing, sorry. The problem that I had with PWGAN was that it sounded shaky, not metallic. Metallic is my issue in all MelGAN models, though (especially in breathing). With the reduced lr the shakiness is reduced and I can see the target spectrograms resemble the source better and at 500K steps the discriminator is still fighting to improve (but it has not dropped below 0.490, which was my problem before). I got the idea because I thought the discriminator kept converging too quick in the training and hindered the Generator's learning by penalizing it and then I saw in the original paper they used the same LR's.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed is that the GAN generally tends to be much less forgiving in spectrogram mismatches from TTS. My TTS has a lot of vocal fry and this in the GAN translates to noise in the lower frequencies (which I also do not know how to solve).\r\n\r\nI trained without mean-var and I would like to try with mean-var. Also, I trained with prefix **OMP_NUM_THREADS=1** to avoid CPU bottlenecking.

Is the noise you mentioned concentrated at a particular frequency ? When I tried adapting the pretrained Multiband MelGAN model (starting from the 1.4M step) I encountered such noise. \r\n\r\nI am currently training the MelGAN vocoder from scratch with my own data (outputs from tacotron2). For me the high freq noise appeared again at the beginning of training and stayed around for 100k steps. It was quite narrowband and uniform magnitude; also for me was at always centered around a frequency = 1/4th sample rate (1/4 * 22050 = 5512.5 Hz). \r\n\r\nI wonder if it has something do with the PQMF synthesis  ... One of the bands going awry and introducing the noise somehow ? \r\n \r\nHere's a screenshot of the audio power spectrum of synthesized audio viewed in audacity. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26173976/95676945-e60c9c80-0be3-11eb-96f2-8f4797bdd657.png)\r\n\r\nI am still training - just reached 1M steps.
