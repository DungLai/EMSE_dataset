Is it okay to compute one for the vocoder? Also I've never maganed to train a multi-speaker vocoder with spec_gain: 1 but 20 worked. Is it correlated with the scale_stats file?\r\nPS: will post my mutli band melgan results later this week.

I have been testing PWGAN with single speaker, but I have had trouble with getting it to converge. Before the discriminator, it produces waveforms that sound acceptable, but when the discriminator kicks in, it sounds more metallic, especially when the speaker glottalizes. I've tried different batch sizes but it did not really help. I also tried to start training the discriminator at 100K steps instead but I got no noticeable improvements, either. Is it worth to pretrain the generator for 400K steps instead? I wonder why it does not want to converge, the PWGAN on LJSpeech sounds very good on 675K steps and my dataset has considerably better audio than LJSpeech. I did not have a lot of time to try the generic_vocoder branch.\r\n\r\nThis is the config I use and I will use the same when I train the LibriTTS PWGAN, unless something is wrong with it. I decided I will go for 1100 and 275 instead, because in my tests, 1024 and 256 give me pronunciation issues with the TTS (all other settings are the same). This config here does not have normalization stats, though (because I have not used them with my TTS). Do they help a lot? I did not want to compute them, because I wanted more variety in the speech.\r\n\r\nI will switch to universal training this week. 🙂\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"github_branch\":\"* dev\",\r\n    \"run_name\": \"pwgan\",\r\n    \"run_description\": \"parallel-wavegan training\",\r\n\r\n    // AUDIO PARAMETERS\r\n    \"audio\":{\r\n        \"fft_size\": 1100,         // number of stft frequency levels.

am training the larger model now too. I am training for 275 and 1100 and for 22050 only, in hopes for saving some time, but it is taking so long. I could only fit a batch size of 8.
