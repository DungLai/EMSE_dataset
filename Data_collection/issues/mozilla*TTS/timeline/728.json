has been automatically closed, but the issue has not been fixed.\r\n\r\n On the README.md main page, there is this:\r\n\r\n> Install TTS\r\n> TTS supports python >= 3.6, <3.9.\r\n> \r\n> If you are only interested in [synthesizing speech](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/tree/dev#example-synthesizing-speech-on-terminal-using-the-released-models) with the released TTS models, installing from PyPI is the easiest option.\r\n> \r\n> pip install TTS\r\n\r\nBut that installation instruction will fail for some people. It should say:\r\n\r\n> Ubuntu 20.04 instructions:\r\n> \r\n> cd .local/\r\n> python3 -m venv mozilla-tts\r\n> cd mozilla-tts\r\n> source bin/activate\r\n> python3 -m pip install --upgrade TTS numpy\r\n> \r\n> Numpy should be installed from PIP instead of using the system python3-numpy package from Debian/Ubuntu 20.04. Installing tts to a venv requires /tmp having more than 4GB, or installation will encounter \"No space left on device\" errors. To bump /tmp up to 8GB, do this: sudo mount -o remount,size=8G /tmp/\r\n> ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/1103434771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xandark","id":5048913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDg5MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5048913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark","html_url":"https://github.com/xandark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xandark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
