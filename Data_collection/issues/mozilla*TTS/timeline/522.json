This means there are pauses where they are not marked in the text and commas that are not kept by the narrator (she doesn't stop). All these things affect training and inference and may be mitigated with different data. A good quality set (with no background noise, absolute match in transcriptions and pauses only in punctuation), would easily get you synthesis of up to 5K characters with minimal, or no statistical errors.
