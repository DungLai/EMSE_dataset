In the meanwhile, I tried the following but I'm still having similar issues:\r\n\r\n1) Reducing all batch sizes to 32 and when that failed to 16.\r\n\r\n2) Reducing max_seq_len to 120 and to even 80. Note that I'm using VCTK and LibriTTS databases with silence trimming on. I also checked the outputs of silence trimming to make sure I'm not getting any audio that's too short etc.\r\n\r\n3) Tried adding forced memory clean-up in the training loop using torch.cuda.empty_cache(). This helped me get through more iterations without OOM errors but they eventually started showing up again.\r\n\r\n4) I noticed that when I decrease save_step from 10K to a lower value in the config file, I see these errors more often. However, I can't say that I observe a consistent pattern. For instance, save_step=25000 trains fine until about 54K steps and then runs out of memory again.\r\n\r\n5) I'm now trying fixed reduction rate. Should I try turning off double_decoder_consistency, too? \r\n\r\n6) The OOM error can be handled as @albluc24 suggested but it eventually results in NaN loss.\r\n\r\n7) I'll check the mel spectrogram values to see if there are all-zero or inf values. If that's the case and if there's any zero padding happening in the code, that might be causing some kind of underflow/overflow in mel spectrogram calculations.\r\n\r\n8) I also tried using VCTK only assuming it's caused by adding LibriTTS but observed similar problems there, too.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking into it and updating you here but I wonder if you have other suggestions.

I'll try setting it closer to the full bandwidth. BTW, I haven't resampled the original databases to 22KHz. I believe original VCTK is at 48KHz and LibriTTS is 24KHz. I made some changes in audio utils to handle resampling but maybe I did something wrong.
