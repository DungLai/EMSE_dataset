So for instance, if you train a model with only characters things are almost 2 times faster. \r\n\r\nMy suggestions are \r\n\r\n-  Replace phoneme extraction with another network by training it with the outputs of espeak.\r\n- If anyone knows any faster alternative, let's switch to that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/639366379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/639884273","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/417#issuecomment-639884273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/417","id":639884273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzOTg4NDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"nmstoker","id":3694484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3694484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker","html_url":"https://github.com/nmstoker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-05T23:06:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T09:53:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@erogol is that speed impact in training really all attributable to espeak though?  I thought the phonemes for the training dataset were worked out in the first epoch and then it re-uses them from the cache?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm clutching at straws here, but could some of the reduction in training speed with phonemes relate to it using roughly twice as many symbols compared to plain text? (I forget the exact number of phonemes for English but isn't it said to be around 40-something)\r\n\r\nI did some very basic testing of code I've written which runs sentences through espeak (but then  does additional processing for improved heteronyms handling) and it came out at around 13ms per sentence and that's with the overhead of my (_non-optimised!_) heteronym code on top and independent calls to espeak each time. That kind of timing looks like it would be dwarfed by the rest of the TTS times, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not against exploring better options, I suppose a couple of points to bear in mind with solutions are:\r\n- How adaptable it is to different languages/accents (assuming the aim is to make a replacement that's still reasonably easy to plug in for basically any language)\r\n- How custom words could be handled (presumably you'd want some mechanism so one didn't need to retrain just to add the latest inconsistently spoken words!)\r\n- The quality of the output and how flaws could be handled effectively\r\n\r\nYour first point about using espeak to generate the training sounds like it would address the language aspects above.  And maybe for the second point it's just a matter of substituting the relevant set of phoneme tokens in the output with the custom phonemes (that's effectively how my heteronym code works once it has decided which of the variants is most likely to apply).\r\n\r\nWith my last point, I've generally found espeak pretty reasonable but it has some definite weak points, so anything which used data from it wholesale would just be importing those weak points. But maybe using it as a source is the best option for now and that's something to think about for later? :slightly_smiling_face: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/639884273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nmstoker","id":3694484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3694484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker","html_url":"https://github.com/nmstoker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3413645679,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQxMzY0NTY3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3413645679","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-05T23:06:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3413645680,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MTM2NDU2ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3413645680","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-05T23:06:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/640043221","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/417#issuecomment-640043221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/417","id":640043221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDA0MzIyMQ==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-06T11:26:17Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T11:26:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yes for training it is not a problems but for inference it computes phonemes too.
