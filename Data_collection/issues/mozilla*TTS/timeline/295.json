for taking the time to respond, this is a tricky issue that we need to work through together as a community. As the leading TTS code base, I think there is a great opprotunity to start defining what ethical open source lifelike TTS looks like! :) \r\n\r\n**Goal(s)**\r\n- Mitigate the risk that Mozilla's open-source TTS system is used to harm another person.\r\n- Ensure that deep learning research is available and accessible. \r\n\r\n**Suggestion**\r\nOpen source an analysis of the project ethics as a markdown or blog post. The analysis should cover the ethical implications of open source life-life TTS. Then, the analysis should be tied back to concrete development practices. Lastly, in order to validate the analysis, there should be some feedback from an expert in AI ethics. \r\n\r\n**Example Outcome**\r\n~A bad actor may want easy access to lifelike TTS to exploit senior citizens with automated phone calls. In order to mitigate that risk, Mozilla doesn't make trained TTS models accessible without going through a basic application system. Furthermore, Mozilla restricts the models from being used commercially.~\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/546052779/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PetrochukM","id":7424737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjQ3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7424737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM","html_url":"https://github.com/PetrochukM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/546055558","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/295#issuecomment-546055558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/295","id":546055558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjA1NTU1OA==","user":{"login":"PetrochukM","id":7424737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjQ3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7424737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM","html_url":"https://github.com/PetrochukM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PetrochukM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-24T18:56:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T00:26:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Lastly,

appreciate the intention @PetrochukM but these misuses seem hard to defend against from within this repo or based on tying it to analysis, which the skeptic in me thinks may just slow down progress without discernible benefit. I think that the ethical discussion, important as it is, would be more suited to happen at another level and in a more general sense that is detached from this specific project (since the concerns are common to all TTS). Saying this, I'm merely giving personal opinions here and have no formal ethics experience.\r\n\r\nIf we take your two suggestions of making people go through an application process and restrictions commercial use, these would likely not deter someone motivated by the exploration of senior citizens. Someone who might proceed with that kind of scam will not be concerned about breaking commercial terms because it pales in comparison to the punishment relating to a scam. It would likely be hard to prove in any case. And only an application that severely impacted legitimate users would have the sort of teeth required to stop or slow down a bad actor.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'll try to keep an open mind and look forward to hearing what others have to say on
