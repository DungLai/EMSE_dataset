stuff, which type of attention did you use for gst?

Have seen some similar effects to yours where the tokens influence length of pauses or commas or even which commas are attended to and which don't (e.g. first or last).

I cannot find it in the code and I don't know how to integrate it with multi-head attention.\r\nDid you just took the token (which has size embed_dim / num_heads) and replicated it num_head times to get the size to embed_dim?\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/566572397/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"donand","id":10143667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQzNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10143667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand","html_url":"https://github.com/donand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2890104276,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg5MDEwNDI3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/2890104276","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-17T14:46:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2890104283,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4OTAxMDQyODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/2890104283","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-17T14:46:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/566786996","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/167#issuecomment-566786996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/167","id":566786996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Njc4Njk5Ng==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T22:57:21Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T22:57:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
