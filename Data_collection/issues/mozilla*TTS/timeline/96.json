Five epochs are not enough. I just want to make sure that there is no error, then I will train for more epochs.\r\nI have 4692 audio files along with their transcripts in my dataset. I used 10 different audiobooks from 10 different speakers to prepare this dataset. Audio files vary in length from 1.5 to 10 seconds and have a total length of approximately 8.5 hours. I want to use this dataset for training a Speech-to-Text model like `deepspeech`. Then, I decided to take a subset of these audio files which belongs to a single speaker and train a Text-to-Speech model like TTS. I take 915 audio files (5769 seconds) of my dataset and trained 'TTS' for a few epoch as you saw before. I read somewhere that \"two hours of dataset is enough for `wavenet` to generate crystal clear quality of audio\", so I thought this subset can be good enough for the first try. What do you think?
