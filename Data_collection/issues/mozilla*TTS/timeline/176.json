I don't think it is also compatible anymore with the dataloader. \r\n\r\nSome questions to follow up the discussion:\r\n\r\n- Do you think it is relevant for your case? If so, why ?\r\n- My preference is to use the first epoch of the dataloader to cache the files. You can see the implementation for the phoneme computation in TTSDataset.py. I decided that way since caching files with a separate script puts an additional mental burden for me to run multiple experiments.\r\n\r\nBut of course, if people find it useful, it is better to keep it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/487122974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/487132233","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/176#issuecomment-487132233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/176","id":487132233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzEzMjIzMw==","user":{"login":"twerkmeister","id":1107341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister","html_url":"https://github.com/twerkmeister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T17:13:19Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T17:13:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah I see, good that I asked first.
