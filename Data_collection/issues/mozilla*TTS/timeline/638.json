In short:\r\n- both `train` and `evaluate` in `train_vocoder_wavernn.py` now cast the `ground_mel` to Tensor and to GPU if `cuda`\r\n- restructured `vocoder/utils/generic_utils.py` by integrating `setup_wavernn` within `setup_generator` even though technically it's an autoregressive model. This keeps `load_vocoder` in `TTS/utils/synthesizer.py` in tact. An additional `generator_model` is in turn added to the `wavernn` config `json`. I think this makes sense as it keeps all vocoders under one hood. If not the vocoder model check could be moved to `load_vocoder`.\r\n- included a bit of an ugly workaround that avoids `capitalize` for `WaveRNN` to preserve the class name as is.\r\n- changed the `inference` function to allow it to run with a single input argument when called by `tts` in `synthesizer`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/773146942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gerazov","id":15214418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjE0NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15214418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov","html_url":"https://github.com/gerazov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4341315660,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDM0MTMxNTY2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/4341315660","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-17T13:14:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
