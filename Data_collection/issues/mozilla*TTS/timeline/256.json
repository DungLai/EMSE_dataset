question! My hunch is, that it is because some parts of the model don't get restored but recreated from scratch when you restart a training with changed parameters. An example for this is the prenet and final projection component in Tacotron2 when you restart with a different `r` value. The number incoming/outgoing connections changes and so that network part gets regenerated. Possibly it resets the learning rate then to make sure the whole network is being readjusted to this new component.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/520156968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"twerkmeister","id":1107341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister","html_url":"https://github.com/twerkmeister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/520347527","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/256#issuecomment-520347527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/256","id":520347527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDM0NzUyNw==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T09:01:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T09:01:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JRMeyer the reason was that if you like to finetune the model than you might prefer smaller LR than before.
