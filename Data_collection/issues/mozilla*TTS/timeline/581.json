I have not really investigated the code yet. \r\nBut the error only appears when there is a value=1000 inside the tensor s. Guess because it's only 0-999 for the noise schedule.\r\n\r\nSo ` s = torch.randint(1, self.num_steps, [y_0.shape[0]])` should be sufficient here, but not sure how it might impact the model performance here.\r\n\r\nBut thinking about it, wouldn't -1 just be the last value of the list?
