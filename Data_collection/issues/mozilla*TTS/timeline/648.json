I wanted to test some of the old model on my Linux system, it said that the TTS version should be <=v0.0.13, so I have downloaded the older version from the [releases](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/releases). But then I got the same error I had in Windows **_ValueError:  [!] Language en-us is not supported for phonemization._**, then I saw that he removed phonemizer support due to license conflict.\r\n\r\nSo then I went back on my Windows10 machine, and I manage to run the TTS, it seems that I was using old model, and that is why I got that error. Here is the full explanation (How to run TTS on Windows10, 64-bit)\r\n***\r\n\r\n_!! Change Slaviboy with your windows username (C:\\Users\\Slaviboy\\..  => C:\\Users\\Your_Username!!_\r\n1) Install python version < 3.8  (mine was Python 3.8.7) from here https://www.python.org/downloads/\r\n3) Install **_pip_**\r\n4) Go to C:\\Users\\Slaviboy\\AppData\\Local\\tts\\   and delete everything from there, in case you have downloaded some older models\r\n5) Download the latest TTS version as Zip, at the time I am writing this it is [v0.0.15.1](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/releases).\r\n6) Extract the Zip file on your desktop\r\n7) Open Cmd or PowerShell as administrator\r\n     - Press 'Start' windows button\r\n     - Type in PowerShell\r\n     - Right click on it and then 'Run as administrator'\r\n     \r\n8) Now go to the ..TTS\\bin\\ directory where you have extracted the Zip file by typing\r\n     >  **_cd C:\\Users\\Slaviboy\\Desktop\\TTS-0.0.15.1\\TTS-0.0.15.1\\TTS\\bin_**\r\n     \r\n9) Now type in\r\n     > **_python synthesize.py --text \"Text for TTS\" --model_name \"tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC\" --out_path C:/output.wav_**\r\n     \r\n8) Wait for the model to download, and run the same command again!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThere is no need to install eSpeak, if you use the **tacotron2-DDC** model, and there is no need to change the config.json file.\r\n     ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/859627757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"slaviboy","id":40918079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTE4MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40918079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy","html_url":"https://github.com/slaviboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slaviboy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
