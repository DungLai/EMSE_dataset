@erogol , I'd like to help you integrate the WORLD vocoder.  It seems we need a way to extract the params needed for the vocoder.  One option for extraction and synthesis could be `pyworld` library.  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pyworld as pw\r\nimport soundfile as sf\r\n\r\n# numpy_array, sample_rate\r\nx, fs = sf.read(path)\r\n# f0, spectrogram, aperiodicities\r\nf0, sp, ap = pw.wav2world(x, fs)\r\n\r\n# numpy_array\r\ny = pw.synthesize(f0, sp, ap, fs, pw.default_frame_period)\r\n\r\nsf.write(\"/path/to/audio.wav\", y, fs)\r\n```\r\nSince the linear spectrogram is already being predicted by the post net, it seems we need to also predict `f0` and `aperiodicities`.  Is it possible to pass `f0` and `aperiodicity` targets and predict them using a post net as well?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/385460202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stevemurr","id":11822551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODIyNTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11822551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr","html_url":"https://github.com/stevemurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevemurr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1601948794,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYwMTk0ODc5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/1601948794","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-30T16:56:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1601948796,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MDE5NDg3OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/1601948796","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-30T16:56:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/385773508","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/9#issuecomment-385773508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/9","id":385773508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTc3MzUwOA==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-01T20:02:21Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T20:02:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stevemurr thanks for the post.
