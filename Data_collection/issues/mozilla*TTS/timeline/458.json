Auto-regressive models like WaveRNN are inherently slow, and as far as I know, we can't do much to overcome this. NVIDIA's WaveGlow is a non-autoregressive model that achieved a good MOS compared to WaveRNN, but the training is very resource consuming. It may be a good idea to take this conversation to discourse.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/659097887/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LucasRotsen","id":32937600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTM3NjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32937600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen","html_url":"https://github.com/LucasRotsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/659350749","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/458#issuecomment-659350749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/458","id":659350749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTM1MDc0OQ==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-16T11:29:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T11:29:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n> \r\n> > > As someone who is using WaveRNN - even after training the PWGAN and MelGAN models - I think people still use it due to the quality of the generated audio.

that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/667024100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3607645437,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYwNzY0NTQzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3607645437","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-31T09:17:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3607645439,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MDc2NDU0Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3607645439","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-31T09:17:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/667025678","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/458#issuecomment-667025678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/458","id":667025678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzAyNTY3OA==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T09:21:15Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T09:21:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

I think we just need to place the model under the vocoder folder and add it to the train_vocoder.py with necessary changes or we can create a new train_wavernn.py script. As I write this I believe writing a new script makes more sense since train_vocoder.py is for GAN training. \r\n\r\nIf you could help with that, then I can add it to the inference pipeline to use it seamlessly at inference as we use GAN vocoders.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/667025678/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/667412969","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/458#issuecomment-667412969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/458","id":667412969,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzQxMjk2OQ==","user":{"login":"LucasRotsen","id":32937600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTM3NjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32937600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen","html_url":"https://github.com/LucasRotsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasRotsen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T22:31:58Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T12:57:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Nice, @erogol!
