The workaround is the right way to run the checkpoint. This repo is currently in a very rush development process with no beta or alpha release yet. That said, we change things very fast and update the repo without any release cycle. Therefore, the master branch is most likely to have updates which are not available at the time of checkpoint. In your case, it is stop token prediction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/388328896/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1621680331,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYyMTY4MDMzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/1621680331","actor":{"login":"cuuupid","id":6960204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjAyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6960204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid","html_url":"https://github.com/cuuupid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-11T10:43:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1621680332,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MjE2ODAzMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/1621680332","actor":{"login":"cuuupid","id":6960204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjAyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6960204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid","html_url":"https://github.com/cuuupid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuuupid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-11T10:43:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1621680787,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTYyMTY4MDc4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/1621680787","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-11T10:43:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
