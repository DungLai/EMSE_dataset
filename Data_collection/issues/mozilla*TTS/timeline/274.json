So basically the idea to find the right audio processing parameters is to use different values and compare the voice resynthesis results with Griffin-Lim and pick the best parameters.

I am referring to the audio processing parameters, as I think these are the faulty ones.\r\nCan you please explain in more depth the procedure to replicate the procedure stated in notebooks for an
