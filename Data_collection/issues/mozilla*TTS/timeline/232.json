interesting is that the espeak under ubuntu removes all punctuation. This is a bit of a pity as it would certainly be important information for pauses in the speech or for intonation (questions vs statements).\r\nHere's what I learned about this issue so far: \r\n1. Unfortunately, right now there is no command line option for espeak to keep the punctuation as in the source text (https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/issues/275)\r\n2. There is a command line option `--punct` that leads to punctuation being pronounced explicitly, i.e `, -> comma`. It would certainly be possible to use this and then have a use a regex on the resulting pattern. Possibly enclosing punctuation in other rare symbols to make the result more unique, e.g. `@,@`.\r\n3. Apart from that I saw that the phonemizer module removes stress marks from the resulting phoneme sequence. I wonder wether this is desirable or if we should actually keep those.
