Could you explain a little more about the parameter 'wd' in the config? I see it is used in updating the model parameters after the back-prop step (before the 'check_update' method), but don't quite get the purpose of the update: why do you subtract a small value from the model parameters right before computing the gradient norm? Is it just a numeric operation to make the computation more stable?
