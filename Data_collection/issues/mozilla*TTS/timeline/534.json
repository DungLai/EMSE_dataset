And switch it to bn after some training.\r\n\r\nSorry maybe I should have stated that initially I tried training it with `prenet_type: original` and had the same results.\r\nUsing a single-speaker + phonemes works on the other hand.\r\n\r\nWhat confuses me is that training on graphemes works just fine. There the attention aligns already at around ~3k steps.\r\n\r\nI will test some more and report back if I find something. Could be obv. also a problem on my end. ^^","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/702133999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lexkoro","id":6319070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTkwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6319070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro","html_url":"https://github.com/lexkoro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexkoro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/702569378","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/534#issuecomment-702569378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/534","id":702569378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjU2OTM3OA==","user":{"login":"george-roussos","id":25833833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODMzODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25833833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos","html_url":"https://github.com/george-roussos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/george-roussos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-02T07:16:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T07:16:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Try a run restoring Thorsten's TTS.
