Therefore it is better to choose models by listening to their output speech.

The reason for this is that although their modified times were different (mtime), their metadata changed times (ctime) was in fact the same:\r\n```bash\r\n$ ls -lhc\r\n\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 gerazov gerazov 4,0K feb 10 08:37 test_audios/\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gerazov gerazov  46M feb  7 16:44 best_model.pth.tar\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gerazov gerazov  46M feb  7 16:44 checkpoint_100000.pth.tar\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gerazov gerazov  46M feb  7 16:44 checkpoint_25000.pth.tar\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gerazov gerazov  46M feb  7 16:44 checkpoint_50000.pth.tar\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gerazov gerazov  46M feb  7 16:44 checkpoint_75000.pth.tar\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 gerazov gerazov 6,8K feb 10 08:37 config.json\r\n```\r\nThis is probably related to how or where I moved them, in fact even though I used `rsync -ahr` something triggered a change in ctime ... I did symlink the new location maybe that's to blame? \r\n\r\nThis could be solved by step-stamping the `best_model.pth.tar` so training continues from the last step found in a best_model or a checkpoint. This would be robust to copying/sharing models. It also has the benefit of maintaining a sequence of best models as training proceeds as I mentioned.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/776659116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gerazov","id":15214418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjE0NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15214418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov","html_url":"https://github.com/gerazov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/776687296","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/643#issuecomment-776687296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/643","id":776687296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjY4NzI5Ng==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-10T12:55:32Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T12:56:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it makes sense.
