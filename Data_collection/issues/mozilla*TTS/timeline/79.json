At what stage you need a hand?\r\n\r\nBacis steps are as below:\r\n\r\n1. ```git clone https://github.com/mozilla/TTS``` to download TTS\r\n2. ```python setup.py develop``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install libraries\r\n3.  Setup your data with transcription files for training and validation. You can check LJSpeech dataset if you need an example dataset. In general you need a folder full of .wav files and a transcription file.\r\nHere is an example to split LJSpeech into training and validation sets using Linux terminal commands.\r\n```\r\nshuf metadata.csv > metadata_shuf.csv\r\nhead -n 12000 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_train.csv\r\ntail -n 11000 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_val.csv\r\n```\r\n4. If you have a custom dataset write your own processor in ```datasets/preprocess.py```. Your function should return a dictionary as in example LJSpeech preprocessor.\r\n5. change the data fields in config.json for your own dataset.\r\n6. run training ```python train.py --config_path config.json ```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more

Reading the code / folder layout is the best way to get the general hang of things and then if there are points you don't pick up from the wiki and discussions, then ask a question on the forum (don't forget to include context though!) With the project undergoing continuing development, it is likely that things will change often, so there's isn't (yet) a zero effort path for you but things continue to improve and with this being open source you can always contribute as you learn more yourself 🙂 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/667704849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nmstoker","id":3694484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3694484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker","html_url":"https://github.com/nmstoker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3613539425,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYxMzUzOTQyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3613539425","actor":{"login":"tarekegn2020","id":68582671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTgyNjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68582671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020","html_url":"https://github.com/tarekegn2020","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-02T17:52:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3613539427,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MTM1Mzk0Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3613539427","actor":{"login":"tarekegn2020","id":68582671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTgyNjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68582671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020","html_url":"https://github.com/tarekegn2020","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekegn2020/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-02T17:52:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
