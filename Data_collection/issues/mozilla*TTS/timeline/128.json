My feeling is that postnet tries to learn fine-grain information that is missing right after the decoder. And if you compare these two outputs, you also see that there is an important loss difference between postnet_output and decoder_output in the inference time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/472372606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2199840178,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5OTg0MDE3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/2199840178","actor":{"login":"mazzzystar","id":6824141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjQxNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6824141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar","html_url":"https://github.com/mazzzystar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T10:49:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2199840179,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTk4NDAxNzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/2199840179","actor":{"login":"mazzzystar","id":6824141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjQxNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6824141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar","html_url":"https://github.com/mazzzystar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T10:49:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/472389943","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/128#issuecomment-472389943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/128","id":472389943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjM4OTk0Mw==","user":{"login":"mazzzystar","id":6824141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjQxNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6824141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar","html_url":"https://github.com/mazzzystar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mazzzystar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T11:47:57Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T11:50:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The

Therefore it uses mel-spectrograms as decoder output. Then the postnet only needs to learn projecting mel-spec to linear which is possibly an easier task to learn. Also you can change the postnet as some point with a better alternative as you keep the rest the same.\r\n\r\nFor Tacotron2 the ideas is similar but not the same. So with the decoder we learn a rough spectrogram representation that enables decoder to also learn the alignment. Then we train the postnet to only learn the fine details. If we'd use a sinlge loss function with the ultimate network output we couldn't force the network to have this kind of modularization.
