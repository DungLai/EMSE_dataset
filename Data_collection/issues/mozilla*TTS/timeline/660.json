I agree it makes sense to be language agnostic and I haven't any particular preferences, although I appreciate it's something of a bodge with the comments breaking the strict .JSON format.\r\n\r\nI'm open minded on the specific format so long as it's easily human readable/editable in a basic text editor (as a minimum).\r\nTwo formats that spring to mind are:\r\n\r\nYAML (am I right in thinking that there's some handling for this already?)\r\n\r\nHJSON - https://hjson.github.io/ I haven't used anything with this but it seems to deal with the comment issue and has a few other accomodations to make it easier, it's supported in a few other languages and has some editor integrations for formatting.\r\n\r\nSomething I'd raised before is the idea of config being \"composable\" - by which I mean that you can have two or more layers of config that get combined into the final config.\r\n\r\nThis initially seems more complicated but I suspect it would ease a number of common scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. It would mean that the core of config settings was common and could be read from a default location\r\n\r\n2. Variations on models then only need to define their new config values, as they can inherit the common core config\r\n\r\n3. When there are widely needed config changes, it's simpler if these are in the core config - this gets us away from the situation where you take an existing config that worked and find the updated repo complains about a missing field that was recently added but your existing config doesn't have.\r\nI've seen this trip up new users a few times, so whilst it's not necessarily a major worry for more experienced users it seems helpful in general.\r\n\r\n4. As a user experimenting, you would have your base config and then each variant that you want to test has a very simple obvious set of changes, eg if you're just tweaking three settings then each variant config just sets those and the rest come from the base - you can get this with a diff but it's just that little bit easier to work with\r\n\r\n5. Composing would also mean that personal file locations are less likely to end up in the repo and you can set your own ones once locally and they'll persist.\r\n\r\nI know there are some modules that enable this but as you raised before, it's important we don't add excessive dependencies. That said, there's a nice looking module called Hydra which seems very much aligned with the needs here\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/pytorch/hydra-a-fresh-look-at-configuration-for-machine-learning-projects-50583186b710\r\n\r\nhttps://hydra.cc/\r\n\r\nOne last point from me (for now!):\r\n\r\nShould we think about what level of config makes most sense?\r\nCurrently we've got config files for TTS models and vocoders, which is sensible as they're distinct things but they also have a fair bit of crossover.\r\nIn addition we've got settings and command line parameters we pass onto the TTS cli and server.py, so maybe something that works well with those is worth thought too?\r\n\r\nAnyway that's plenty to be thinking about, so I'll stop to see that others suggest.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/782049957/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nmstoker","id":3694484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3694484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker","html_url":"https://github.com/nmstoker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/782388583","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/660#issuecomment-782388583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/660","id":782388583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjM4ODU4Mw==","user":{"login":"gerazov","id":15214418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjE0NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15214418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov","html_url":"https://github.com/gerazov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerazov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T21:56:15Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T21:56:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I third this :+1: \r\n\r\nThings are a bit messy atm with everything being in one file, and having one file for each model type with a lot of overlap inbetween. In fact adding a new parameter now is quite tedious as one needs to update all config JSONs in the project (18 in total for #649 :sweat_smile: ) Plus JSON doesn't support comments so they end up messing up some editors, e.g. in vim you need a special plugin that will not treat the comments as errors, and even GitHub doesn't like it :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\nAs far as formats go I think YAML is a sensible choice. It's Python like, but not Python specific (as per  @erogol's point 1.), and is also well established. :+1: \r\n\r\nHaving modularity is very important here as @nmstoker elaborates. We should for sure keep model configs model specific, and have more general ones for common parameters. \r\n\r\nThe most important one here is to at least have a separate `database` config. This will allow users to easily apply the default model settings to a different database without having to recreate a database specific model config. Other ones could be (from present config): `TENSORBOARD and LOGGING`, `AUDIO PARAMETERS` (although they are database specific so they might go with the database config), `TRAINING` and `VALIDATION` ...\r\n\r\nGoing one step further it would be awesome to have hierarchical overloading of default ones with your custom ones, e.g. having a default `sample_rate` of `22050`, which is then overloaded by the `sample_rate: 16000` field in your database config.\r\n\r\nHydra is a nice catch @nmstoker I think it's definitely worth considering for this project :+1:
