chatting with Neil (@nmstoker) and experimenting on my local environment i learned the following lessons which might be helpful for others.\r\n\r\nUsing the following prepared datasets/files combination worked for me for compute embeddings:\r\n- model/config template (libretts_360): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CwXxwm0qKk2lcPL_4EQDirD8XMyvHIqR\r\n- raw wav/metadata: https://openslr.org/60/ \r\n  - train-clean-100.tar.gz\r\n  - train-clean-360.tar.gz: \r\n\r\n- Extract tgz files\r\n- Adjust config.json (downloaded template from googledrive) for your local environment path\r\n  - restore_path\r\n  - sample_rate: 22050\r\n  - output_path\r\n  - datasets (path)\r\n- Exec \"compute_embeddings.py\" with required params (will be executed if missing)\r\n- During process run several .npy files will be created in subdirectories under <output_path>\r\n\r\nIf you see a growing number of .npy files you're on a good way.\r\n\r\nAfter process has finished it's time to take a look to the jupyter notebook \"PlotUmapLibriTTS.ipynb\" under \"/TTS/speaker_encoder/notebooks/\"\r\n- Modify path vars in notebook to match your environment\r\n  - MODEL_RUN_PATH\r\n  - EMBED_PATH\r\n  - AUDIO_PATH\r\n\r\n- Run jupyter notebook step by step\r\n> I got the error about missing \"TTS\" module directly in first block which could be solved by copying the notebook into the parent folder of \"TTS\".\r\n\r\nAt the end of notebook execution the cluster-graph was successfully generated.\r\n\r\nFinally Neil told me a look to Resemblyzer (https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer#what-can-i-do-with-this-package) might be helpful for analyzing quality of dataset.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/588413149/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thorstenMueller","id":9558265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTgyNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9558265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller","html_url":"https://github.com/thorstenMueller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3053147667,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA1MzE0NzY2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3053147667","actor":{"login":"nmstoker","id":3694484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3694484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker","html_url":"https://github.com/nmstoker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-19T19:45:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3053147671,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNTMxNDc2NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3053147671","actor":{"login":"nmstoker","id":3694484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3694484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker","html_url":"https://github.com/nmstoker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-19T19:45:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3053148453,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA1MzE0ODQ1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/3053148453","actor":{"login":"thorstenMueller","id":9558265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTgyNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9558265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller","html_url":"https://github.com/thorstenMueller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorstenMueller/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-19T19:45:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/860364856","html_url":"https://github
