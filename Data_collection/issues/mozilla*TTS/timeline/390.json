For Croqui, the config I was using inherited the audio processor class so I just manually set the attribute AFTER initilization:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom TTS.tts.configs.glow_tts_config import GlowTTSConfig\r\nconfig = GlowTTSConfig(\r\n    batch_size=32,\r\n    eval_batch_size=16,\r\n    num_loader_workers=4,\r\n    num_eval_loader_workers=4,\r\n    run_eval=True,\r\n    test_delay_epochs=-1,\r\n    epochs=100,\r\n    text_cleaner=\"phoneme_cleaners\",\r\n    use_phonemes=True,\r\n    phoneme_language=\"en-us\",\r\n    phoneme_cache_path=os.path.join(output_path, \"phoneme_cache\"),\r\n    print_step=25,\r\n    print_eval=False,\r\n    mixed_precision=True,\r\n    output_path=output_path,\r\n    datasets=[dataset_config],\r\n    save_step=1000,\r\n    eval_split_size = 0.07142857142857142\r\n)\r\n\r\nconfig.audio.sample_rate=48000\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust set the rate equal to whatever the assertion error spits out as the mismatch.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you might also run into an error about shape, it's because the .wav file is stereo, but you need to convert to mono.
