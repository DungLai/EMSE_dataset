That might lead the difference. Othwerwise, I am not quite sure what more is. Maybe hyper-parameters, slight engineering tweaks, better data or small bug with our model :)\r\n\r\nI did not try Tacotron2. However as I see from the other papers mostly about speaker embedding, I see  they use Tacotron over Tacotron2 for some reason. \r\n\r\nI started to add changes towards Tacotron2 (https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/26) however it is a slow procession since I like to see the effect of each changes over the results. So far nothing has a promising improvement. My feeling is that Google use Tacotron2 since WaveNet is also able to recover the sacrifice of the architectural change so I am suspicious if Tacotron2 is better with any other vocoder. \r\n\r\nI have VoiceLoop implementation as well but they also use phonemes and I cannot make it learn with raw characters. Since use of phonemes is a limiting factor for language transition, I'd prefer to go with Tacotron.\r\n\r\nTHX :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/391878452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1645410662,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY0NTQxMDY2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/1645410662","actor":{"login":"Motherboard","id":1024426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1024426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard","html_url":"https://github.com/Motherboard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-24T21:55:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1645410664,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NDU0MTA2NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/1645410664","actor":{"login":"Motherboard","id":1024426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1024426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard","html_url":"https://github.com/Motherboard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Motherboard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-24T21:55:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/402484692","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/34#issuecomment-402484692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/34","id":402484692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjQ4NDY5Mg==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-04T13:48:33Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T13:48:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No
