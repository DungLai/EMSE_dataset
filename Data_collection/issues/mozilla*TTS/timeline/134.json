I've not tried forward attn with LJSpeech yet. However, for our internal dataset, the one works best is the config_cluster.json. I'll post here, if I have a chance to go on LJspeech.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/498180990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/499958556","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/134#issuecomment-499958556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/134","id":499958556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTk1ODU1Ng==","user":{"login":"m-toman","id":9433378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzMzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9433378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman","html_url":"https://github.com/m-toman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-07T16:50:58Z","updated_at":"2019-06-07T16:50:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/499958556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"m-toman","id":9433378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzMzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9433378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman","html_url":"https://github.com/m-toman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2397846753,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM5Nzg0Njc1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/events/2397846753","actor":{"login":"m-toman","id":9433378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzMzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9433378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman","html_url":"https://github.com/m-toman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-07T16:50:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/531739034","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/134#issuecomment-531739034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues
