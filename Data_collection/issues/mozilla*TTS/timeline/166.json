Quality can vary by speaker. For some attention doesn't work as well as for others. For some there is  a lot of noise in the generated audio. The amount of training material per speaker follows a power law, i.e. few speakers with a lot of material, many with little (at least 100 sentences so far). I haven't done any work correlating amount of training material and quality. \r\n\r\n2. I am wondering if Global Style Tokens can replace speaker embeddings completely. They were meant to capture mainly prosody, like speaking speed or emotions etc. But I can't see why they couldn't also capture things more related to the voice of a person, such as the pitch. One difficulty in dissecting the style tokens could be that some will end up being correlated, e.g. excitement and pitch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/487491719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"twerkmeister","id":1107341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister","html_url":"https://github.com/twerkmeister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/487587247","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/166#issuecomment-487587247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/166","id":487587247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzU4NzI0Nw==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-29T13:50:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T13:50:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are some papers from Amazon with multi-speaker experiments.

But the good thing about GST it enables one-shot learning as in the paper where you provide a new speaker with a sample spectrogram and model generates her speech. \r\n\r\nAlso as far as I see, Common Voice dataset is not really reliable for TTS since its recordings are not really clear. Maybe, it is better to try MATLAB dataset. It has a handful of German speakers with comparable portions. It is more promising to test.\r\n\r\nSorry, my comments are scattered :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/487587247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/487592871","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/166#issuecomment-487592871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/166","id":487592871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzU5Mjg3MQ==","user":{"login":"twerkmeister","id":1107341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister","html_url":"https://github.com/twerkmeister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twerkmeister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-29T14:04:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T14:04:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool stuff!

I was hoping that with the encoder it results in a nice \"coverage\" of the speaker embedding space with the 150k sentences. And while learning overall speaker characteristics (let's say, vocal tract features) seems to work very well, prosodic aspects seem to be a problem..\r\n\r\nUsing the same embedding from a single, random sentence (as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04558 ) I get sentences that are really slow and others that are really fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if instead of using per-sentence embeddings it might be better to use per-speaker averaged embeddings for all sentences of a speaker, to reduce the variation introduced by single sentences, especially at inference time. So it's more similar to your current approach of using a single speaker ID for all sentences of a speaker (but with some encoded knowledge instead of \"randomly\" assigned IDs).\r\n\r\nAlso perhaps trying a few speakers with lots of sentences instead of lots of speakers with few sentences. Did you test something like that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/514552804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"m-toman","id":9433378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzMzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9433378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman","html_url":"https://github.com/m-toman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-toman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/comments/514566523","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/166#issuecomment-514566523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/TTS/issues/166","id":514566523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDU2NjUyMw==","user":{"login":"erogol","id":1402048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1402048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol","html_url":"https://github.com/erogol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erogol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T09:58:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T09:58:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@m-toman if you could plot speaker embedding vectors with TSNE that would be great to compare with a vanilla speaker embedding we have.
