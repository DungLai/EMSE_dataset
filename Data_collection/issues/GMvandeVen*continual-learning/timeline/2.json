You're right, there was a mistake in the code. The stored exemplars were not actually being added to the training data. They were added to [training_dataset], but then erroneously [train_dataset] was used to train on. The change I made to fix this was to replace [train_dataset] by [training_dataset] in line 117 of `train.py`.\r\n\r\nThe version of the code used to obtain the results reported in the paper did not have this mistake, hence the discrepancy.
