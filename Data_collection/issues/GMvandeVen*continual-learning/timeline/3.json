I just checked the code, but as far as Iâ€™m aware, the final results reported by the code are always the average over all tasks, not just the final task. And for individual experiments, the average performance is also printed for each task separately. For example, running `./main.py --scenario=class` results for me in the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Precision on test-set (softmax classification):\r\n - Task 1: 0.0000\r\n - Task 2: 0.0000\r\n - Task 3: 0.0000\r\n - Task 4: 0.0000\r\n - Task 5: 0.9904\r\n=> average precision over all 5 tasks: 0.1981\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you point me to where you think that the final task performance is reported instead of the average?

Firstly, the desirable incremental learning results are supposed to be reported after each task being trained. Secondly, as given above, the average precision is the exactly wanted task result. However, when I try to reproduce the result with the same parameter (resnet34 for cifar100) in the icarl paper, it seems not to work well. I am keeping work on it. \r\n\r\nThanks again!

For the second one, I am trying another implementation version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/489970077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Harry-Up","id":26539945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM5OTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26539945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up","html_url":"https://github.com/Harry-Up","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2323299697,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMyMzI5OTY5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/events/2323299697","actor":{"login":"Harry-Up","id":26539945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM5OTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26539945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up","html_url":"https://github.com/Harry-Up","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harry-Up/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-07T07:44:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/490055369","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/3#issuecomment-490055369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/3","id":490055369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDA1NTM2OQ==","user":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T12:18:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T12:18:18Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thanks for your reply. Regarding your first point, I should note that if you run the code with `--visdom` enabled, the intermediate results after training on each task are reported in the form of a graph. But if you want those results printed to the screen, the code would indeed need to be modified slightly. Regarding your second point, one thing I can say is that (with very messy extended code) I was able to obtain roughly similar results as those in the original iCaRL-paper, although I also found that there is quite some dependence on hyperparameter settings (e.g., the step-wise reduced learning rate).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/490055369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
