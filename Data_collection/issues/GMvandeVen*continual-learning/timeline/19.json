I expect that this is the final performance on a class-incremental learning experiment? (So using the flag `--scenario=class`.) In that case, if for example you use no specific continual learning methods, the network tends to overfit on the classes in the last task. In the last task, the network only sees the classes from that task, so then it learns to never predicted classes from the previous tasks anymore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1183527198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1191837377","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/19#issuecomment-1191837377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/19","id":1191837377,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPgkf85HCf7B","user":{"login":"gentlegy","id":12779272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzc5Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12779272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy","html_url":"https://github.com/gentlegy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-21T19:07:53Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T19:07:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, first of first, nice repo. thank you for providing this.\r\n\r\nI have the same confusion. I tried the ewc method by:\r\n`./main.py --ewc --lambda=5000 --visdom`\r\nand by default, I think I use `--experiment=splitMNIST` and `--scenario=class`. The final result looks like:\r\n` Precision on test-set:\r\n - Task 1: 0.0000\r\n - Task 2: 0.0000\r\n - Task 3: 0.0000\r\n - Task 4: 0.0000\r\n - Task 5: 0.9939\r\n=> Average precision over all 5 tasks: 0.1988`\r\n\r\nBased on the comment, I guess I should tune the learning rate to make it less overfitting? How about the lambda parameter? Can you provide a reasonable parameters in comment so I could try to make sense on the result?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1191837377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gentlegy","id":12779272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzc5Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12779272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy","html_url":"https://github.com/gentlegy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1218341181","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/19#issuecomment-1218341181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/19","id":1218341181,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPgkf85Inmk9","user":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-17T18:10:01Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T18:10:01Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hi @gentlegy, apologies for the late reply. In the class-incremental learning scenario, as pointed out in the paper accompanying this code repository (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07734), the method EWC indeed does not work well and the results that you found are typical for EWC in this scenario. Methods using some form of replay (e.g., DGR, RtF, ER, A-GEM or iCaRL) typically perform much better with class-incremental learning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1218341181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7208241286,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCPgkf85Ns0OSzwAAAAGtpQiG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/events/7208241286","actor":{"login":"gentlegy","id":12779272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzc5Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12779272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy","html_url":"https://github.com/gentlegy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-17T18:10:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7208241290,"node_id":"SE_lADOCPgkf85Ns0OSzwAAAAGtpQiK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/events/7208241290","actor":{"login":"gentlegy","id":12779272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzc5Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12779272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy","html_url":"https://github.com/gentlegy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gentlegy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-17T18:10:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7211619062,"node_id":"CE_lADOCPgkf85Ns0OSzwAAAAGt2JL2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/events/7211619062","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-18T07:06:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
