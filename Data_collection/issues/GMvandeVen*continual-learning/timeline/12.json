Yes, you are right that so far the successful applications of generative replay have only been on datasets with relatively simple inputs (e.g., MNIST). Based on my own attempts (as well as based on informal discussions with others), scaling up generative replay to problems with more complex inputs (e.g., natural images) turns out not to be straight-forward. So you are probably right that there is something about the combination of more complex inputs + the continual training of the generator that makes it difficult. I hope to soon share my attempts of scaling up generative replay.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/567073580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2920364798,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkyMDM2NDc5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/events/2920364798","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-03T14:42:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
