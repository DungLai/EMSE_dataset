In both repositories, the `.detach()` operation is actually not needed. As you indicate in your comment, the `.detach()` operation stops backpropagation as it resets any gradients being tracked. However, in both repositories, the `target_norm` variable already did not have any gradients being tracked, as that variable was computed using `with torch.no_grad():` (as for example here: [link](https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/blob/a02db26d3b10754abdc4a549bdcde6af488c94e0/train.py#L189)).
