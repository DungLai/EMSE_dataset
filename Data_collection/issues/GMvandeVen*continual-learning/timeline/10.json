This issue has confused me for quite a while as well. It turns out that on the split MNIST protocol, the by the developers recommended (or default) hyperparameter-values of SI and especially of EWC don't work very well. For EWC and Online EWC, lambda even needs to be set several orders of magnitude larger.

:"Hi @YeeCY, thanks for your interest in my code. The observation you describe is correct, the methods EWC and SI actually do not work well with class-incremental learning (`--scenario=class`), even with their best hyper parameters; while these methods do work reasonably well with task-incremental learning (`--scenario=task`). See for example this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07734) for more details on the difference between these scenarios.

And I will try to run with task-incremental learning. By the way, would you mind providing best hyperparameters for other algorithms like `AGEM`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/831653415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YeeCY","id":40682795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjgyNzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40682795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY","html_url":"https://github.com/YeeCY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4681039039,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY4MTAzOTAzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/events/4681039039","actor":{"login":"YeeCY","id":40682795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjgyNzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40682795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY","html_url":"https://github.com/YeeCY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-04T02:48:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4681039042,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2ODEwMzkwNDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/events/4681039042","actor":{"login":"YeeCY","id":40682795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjgyNzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40682795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY","html_url":"https://github.com/YeeCY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YeeCY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-04T02:48:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
