because I was confused about the results. When I run online EWC for 100 tasks \r\n(./main.py --ewc --online --lambda=5000 --gamma=1 --experiment permMNIST --scenario task --tasks 100 --fc-units=1000 --lr=0.0001)\r\nand then extract the accuracies as you said for all tasks after learning all tasks, the accuracies for more recent tasks are low.\r\nAssuming I extracted the acc’s correctly, then new tasks are not able to get high accuracies. It looks like this\r\n\r\n[0.9565, 0.9502, 0.9283, 0.9196, 0.8324, 0.898, 0.8769, …,  0.7797, 0.7696, 0.7805]\r\n\r\nThe last entry here is the acc of task n, directly after learning it. That would mean the regularisation hinders the network to actually learn new tasks (?), and protects the \r\nnetwork well from forgetting the old tasks (really well). Did you experience the same? Do you suggest other hyper parameters?\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n> On 24.

The regularisation of EWC indeed hinders the network to learn new tasks (because it penalizes new parameter changes), and this effect gets larger the more tasks have been learned. You can make the network more plastic by reducing lambda (or reducing gamma might also work), which will probably increase the accuracies for the later tasks but reduce those for the earlier tasks. What the optimal values of these EWC hyper parameters are heavily depends on both the type and number of tasks. (The optimal values for different task protocols can differ by several orders of magnitude, see for example Appendix D here:
