To reproduce the results from BI-R + SI as reported in the papers \"[Brain-inspired replay for continual learning with artificial neural networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17866-2)\" and \"[Class-incremental learning with generative classifiers](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/CLVision/html/van_de_Ven_Class-Incremental_Learning_With_Generative_Classifiers_CVPRW_2021_paper.html)\", it is best to use not this repository, but the repository accompanying the brain-inspired replay paper (https://github.com/GMvandeVen/brain-inspired-replay). In that repository, the command `python main_cl.py --experiment=CIFAR100 --scenario=class --brain-inspired --replay=generative --si --dg-prop=0.6 --c=100000000.` can be used to run the same BI-R + SI experiment on the class-incremental version of Split-CIFAR100 as reported in the above two papers.\r\n\r\nIn this repository (https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning) there are a few things implemented slightly differently compared to the brain-inspired replay paper. For example, the default in this repository is to run class-incremental learning experiments with an output layer in which always the output units of all classes are set to active, while in the brain-inspired replay paper an \"expanding head\" was used. (See for example the explanation under the header \"BI-R\" in the methods section (top of p.14) of [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j5fFXUJeDohtg0EP0GTmE2pOYdD0dUiz/view).) In the paper accompanying this repository I only tested BI-R by itself, and not combined with SI. I expect the reason that the second experiment you describe fails, is because using SI with a very high regularization strength might be problematic in a class-incremental learning experiment with always all units set to active (while it is OK with an expanding head).\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1335266346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1336143890","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/21#issuecomment-1336143890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/21","id":1336143890,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPgkf85Po_AS","user":{"login":"valeriya-khan","id":19734197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzM0MTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19734197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan","html_url":"https://github.com/valeriya-khan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-03T11:56:35Z","updated_at":"2022-12-03T12:11:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for such a detailed answer :) \r\nCan I ask why you excluded BI-R + SI from new paper results table?

In [this new paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00568-3) (although the preprint of this new paper is older than the paper on brain-inspired replay) I didn't include BI-R + SI in the comparison because the goal of the experiments in this paper is not to verify/champion a method as achieving state-of-the-art performance, but rather the goal is to compare the performance of different computational strategies for continual learning, and to do that on each of the three continual learning scenarios. To do this I tried to select for each strategy a few representative example methods. As the approach BI-R + SI combines two of those strategies, it wasn't suitable for this comparison. (But if you are interested in doing as well as possible on some continual learning problem, it might indeed often be best to combine multiple strategies.)\r\n\r\nRegarding the second part of your comment, it seems you are right. Thank you for pointing this out. It indeed seems to be the case that also when using the argument `--active-classes=\"all-so-far\"`, the performance of BI-R + SI with the code in this repository is somewhat lower than the performance of BI-R + SI with the code in the repository of the brain-inspired replay paper.

For example, one quite large difference is that, when a fixed feature extractor is used (i.e., the option `--freeze-convE`), in this repository all data are put through the feature extractor once at the beginning (which speeds up things considerably), while in the other repository the data are put through the feature extractor every time they are presented to the network. In principle I don’t think this difference should lead to a difference in performance, but perhaps for some reason it does.\r\n\r\nIf it is important to replicate the performance reported in the brain-inspired replay paper, my suggestion would be the use the original repository accompanying that paper ([this one](https://github.com/GMvandeVen/brain-inspired-replay)). Otherwise it should be fine to use this repository.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1369740454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/comments/1371210752","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/21#issuecomment-1371210752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/21","id":1371210752,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPgkf85RuwQA","user":{"login":"valeriya-khan","id":19734197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzM0MTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19734197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan","html_url":"https://github.com/valeriya-khan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-04T17:24:05Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T17:24:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for your explanations.
