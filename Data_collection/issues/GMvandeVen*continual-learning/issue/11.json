However, I feel like the diagonal of the empirical Fisher information matrix should be calculated by squaring the gradients before taking their average (as done in [this Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/ariseff/overcoming-catastrophic/blob/master/model.py#L65-L68)). Can you please confirm that the order doesn't matter here?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the expected values of the gradients are 0 (see [this Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information)), so if you do averaging first, the Fisher values are very close to 0, which seems incorrect. Am I missing something here? Please let me know what you think. Thank you.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/blob/ff0e03cb913ac0dea4fc59058968b1e6784decfd/continual_learner.py#L110-L125","closed_by":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
