My team and I are currently running experiments with your BI-R repo. We are trying to find the limit between ER and GR approaches and see how much we can degrade examplars (stored or generate) to acheive similar accuracies. As such, we ported your implementation of ER to the other repo. We noticed that on the line 123 of train.py, that the dataset train_datasets is used rather than previous_datasets. Is train_datasets not the full scale dataset? We would love to have your input on this potential issue and if you have and ablation/directions of experiments to run, please do tell! \r\nBtw, your code is absolutely beautiful and so well documented!","closed_by":{"login":"GuillaumeLam","id":23106613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTA2NjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23106613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam","html_url":"https://github.com/GuillaumeLam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeLam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
