Firstly, I wanted to tell thank you for your great work. It was really interesting to read your paper. And you code is really thought-through.\r\nI wanted to ask how can I reproduce the results for brain-inspired combined with synaptic intelligence method? \r\nI tried to run the following command which gave me 18% accuracy:\r\npython main.py --experiment=CIFAR100 --scenario=class --brain-inspired --SI --seed=0 --pre-convE --freeze-convE --seed-to-ltag --time \r\nI also tried:\r\npython main.py --experiment=CIFAR100 --scenario=class --brain-inspired --SI --seed=0 --pre-convE --seed-to-ltag --time --reg-strength=100000000 (10^8) --dg-prop=0.6\r\nas suggested in generative-classifiers paper if I understood correctly. However, even training accuracy dropped to 0 for context 2 during the training.\r\nCan you suggest me correct arguments to reproduce the results from \"Brain-inspired replay for continual learning with artificial neural networks\" for main.py script?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"valeriya-khan","id":19734197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzM0MTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19734197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan","html_url":"https://github.com/valeriya-khan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeriya-khan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
