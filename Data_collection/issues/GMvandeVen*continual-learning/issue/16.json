I have a quick question about the computation in the Fisher Information Matrix update: does the batch_size have to be 1 for the dataloader here: https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/blob/d281967802396b146b2c30b6667369c6f2395472/continual_learner.py#L89 ? My main concern is about the speed here.  Is that equivalent if I use a larger batch size?\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance! :D ","closed_by":{"login":"GMvandeVen","id":27809645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA5NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27809645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen","html_url":"https://github.com/GMvandeVen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GMvandeVen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
