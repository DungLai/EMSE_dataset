It therefore uses the `learn_batch` method of `Naive_Rehearsal` which uses memory data together with the new data to compute the original gradients before checking conflicts with any memory gradients. From my understanding that is not the intent of the original paper and might affect the training results.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `Naive_Rehearal`'s `learn_batch` method already updates the memory and `task_count`, but `GEM` does this a second time once the call returns.","closed_by":{"login":"yenchanghsu","id":6336892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzY4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6336892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu","html_url":"https://github.com/yenchanghsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
