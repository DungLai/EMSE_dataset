I'm trying to reproduce your results for my experiments and used them as baseline. However I have some trouble in reproducing the exact numbers for MNIST data using MLP network that was reported in the paper. I feel the values for the following missing hyper parameters are missing in the paper and the code\r\n1) L2 regularization coefficient used for L2 baseline.\r\n2) Was lr decay used ? If yes can you shed some details on it .\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you can share a config file for the best results you got. Although the paper presents some details about these which is very helpful I feel entire configurations are missing.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","closed_by":{"login":"pavanteja295","id":27847735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODQ3NzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27847735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295","html_url":"https://github.com/pavanteja295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
