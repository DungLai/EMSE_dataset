I'm trying to replicate the results for various methods through your code. First of all I am very much thankful for the scripts as it helps me avoid the burden of finding the best results through hyper parameter sweep. (Although I would try it in the future.)\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to ask is how did you perform the search for regularization coefficients for various datasets and architectures? Did you set some intuitive limits for the grid search by looking at the train and test graphs? I'm asking this as I want to replicate this on other datasets lets say CIFAR-10. I can add the scripts for CIFAR-10 and Image net in the future to your repository once I finish experimenting.\r\n\r\nWould be great if you share your script for the grid search.","closed_by":{"login":"yenchanghsu","id":6336892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzY4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6336892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu","html_url":"https://github.com/yenchanghsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
