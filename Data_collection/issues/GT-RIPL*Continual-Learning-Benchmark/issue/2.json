For this current version there is a small bug in the cifar100 and cifar10 data loaders.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be that cifar class has no attribute training_labels or test_labels which was used in dataloaders/base.py. Also the documentation states no such attributes [CIFAR](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torchvision/datasets/cifar.html#CIFAR10).  However MNIST has such attributes.\r\n\r\nIs this is a bug or was it working for you for the previous versions? It's strange that torchvision lacks homogenity among  datasets.\r\n\r\nLemme know if it's a bug I can raise a pull request ","closed_by":{"login":"pavanteja295","id":27847735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODQ3NzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27847735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295","html_url":"https://github.com/pavanteja295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanteja295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
