It's the clearest implementation I found out there :)\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the mini-batch sampling. In the code, it is commented that it gives similar performance to (sub-sampling with batch_size=1, i.e., the correct mathematical way). But I'm worried that they are very different. \r\nSo I'm curious to know whether there are papers that used this sampling instead and they confirmed its similar performance?\r\n\r\nThe reason for my doubt is that in general, the expected value of the squared gradients of log-likelihoods which is an estimator for the diagonal of the Fisher matrix is not the same as the expected squared expected gradients of log-likelihoods.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration,\r\nArash","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
