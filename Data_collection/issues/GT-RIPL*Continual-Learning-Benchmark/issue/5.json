I am having some issues trying to reproduce naive rehearsal results for class incremental learning task. I executed the naive rehearsal 5600 baseline with the following command:\r\n\r\n`python -u iBatchLearn.py --dataset CIFAR100 --train_aug --gpuid 0 --repeat 5 --incremental_class --optimizer Adam    --force_out_dim 100 --no_class_remap --first_split_size 20 --other_split_size 20 --schedule 80 120 160 --batch_size 128 --model_name WideResNet_28_2_cifar --model_type resnet --agent_type customization  --agent_name Naive_Rehearsal_5600  --lr 0.001`\r\n\r\nComparing the result with Naive Rehearsal-C reported in https://github.com/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/blob/master/fig/results_split_cifar100.png, I obtained the following results:\r\nWith pytorch 1.0.0 and torchvision 0.2.2, the final result is around 40%, instead of 51.28.\r\nWith pytorch 1.4.0 and torchvision 0.5.0, the final result is around 20%, instead of 51.28.\r\n\r\nThis is consistently happening with various GPUs (RTX 2080Ti, Titan Xp and Tesla P4/K80).\r\n\r\nCould you share the environment configuration you used to obtain reported results on CIFAR100?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yenchanghsu","id":6336892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzY4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6336892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu","html_url":"https://github.com/yenchanghsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yenchanghsu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/5/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
