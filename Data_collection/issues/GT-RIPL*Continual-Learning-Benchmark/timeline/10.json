You are right. batch_size=1 and batch_size!=1 are different. That's why the default setting in the MNIST demo uses batch_size=1 (see [here](https://github.com/GT-RIPL/Continual-Learning-Benchmark/blob/master/agents/regularization.py#L110)), although empirically batch_size!=1 gives a similar MNIST performance. It is possible that a different dataset or exp setting may show a different result. \r\n\r\nWhat could make the results similar/dissimilar? The total number of samples may be the major factor. Consider the two cases:\r\n1. 60000 samples with batch_size=1 versus 60000 samples with batch_size=10.\r\n2. 10 samples with batch_size=1 versus 10 samples with batch_size=10.\r\n\r\nIn case 1, the resulting Fisher diagonals are likely to be similar after multiplied with a scaling factor, while case 2 will be very different. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to share your findings with us.
