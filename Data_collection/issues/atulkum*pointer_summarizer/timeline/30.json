You can find it from `Train.trainIters()` from `train.py`. \r\n\r\nTo relate this iteration to the concept of epoch, you need to see how they make the batches, which you can find from `example_generator()` in `data.py`.  From the data_path, it keeps pulling the batches from data_path until they consume all files in the path. After that, they redo this generation process over the data_path again (since it is a generator) unless argument `single_pass` is set as True.\r\n\r\nIn summary, (total # of examples/batch_size) iterations would be _approximately_ the same as one epoch, but note that for the last batch it may have mixed examples.
