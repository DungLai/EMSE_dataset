One process train the model and save the model output at particular interval (like 10000 iteration etc). The other process check if there is new saved model file is there, if it's there then eval it and save the result. Also while evaluating you should make sure the training is not interrupted.  If you have only one gpu then its good to first dump all the model at each 10000 iteration. And then run eval on all those model. if you have more than one gpu run eval on one gpu and training on another gpu. there is also an option of running eval on cpu if you want to run together.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/comments/744570594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"atulkum","id":372035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjAzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum","html_url":"https://github.com/atulkum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4110302698,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDExMDMwMjY5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/events/4110302698","actor":{"login":"atulkum","id":372035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjAzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum","html_url":"https://github.com/atulkum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-14T16:53:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
