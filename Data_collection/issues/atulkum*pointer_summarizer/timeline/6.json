You mean you are getting similar output for example in a single batch. During decode the batch size is same as beam size and all similar output in s single batch is as expected.\r\n> You can compare with the output which I got [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VarHpkj97Q5WK61RUMcdAgDnemmstB8J)\r\n\r\nHi, I don't understand why beam size and batch size are equal in current decode.
