So if the decoder is pointing to that particular token it produces [UNK] in output. Is it correct? Following the paper it seems that the decoder should be able to point to that token and copy it, instead of copying the unknown token. I think it's the whole purpose of the pointer-generator model to handle oovs. But from some experiments in decoding I see that the models often outputs some unknown tokens.\r\nI tried replacing the 50k vocabulary to the full vocabolary but I get cuda device asserted errors.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
