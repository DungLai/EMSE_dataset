I trained the model on custom data set for ~15000 iterations. On decoding, same summery is generated for all the stories. I am not sure where exactly is the problem in code, still debugging. Any help/suggestion is appreciated.\r\nIn beam_search code, there is a comment '#batch should have only one example' where as in BeamSearch constructor, bacther takes batch size same as beam_size(4). Is it correct ?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"atulkum","id":372035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjAzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum","html_url":"https://github.com/atulkum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
