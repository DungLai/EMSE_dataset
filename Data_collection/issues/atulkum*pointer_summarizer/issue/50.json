This is the problem. Because let's say in the first example, we have 1 article_oov word is 'mother', you will assign it by 200,001. In the second example, you have 'father' is the article_oov, you will assign 'father' by 200,001 too. If somehow, 2 above examples are in the same batch, then index of 'father' and 'mother' are the same??","closed_by":{"login":"atulkum","id":372035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjAzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum","html_url":"https://github.com/atulkum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atulkum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
