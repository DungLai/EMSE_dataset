Besides training loss, are there any criteria to help choose the best model? Because I think even if training loss is low, the performance is probably not good.\r\nFor example, I trained two models. One is model_400k iteration, the other is model_500k iteration. But the actual decoded content 400k's model is more reasonable than 500k's.\r\n\r\nThanks a lotÔºÅ ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atulkum/pointer_summarizer/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
