Could you explain it? Whether the method in your code could get a higher performance?\r\n\r\nIn addition, I did not find your single-time activation function in your code. Could u point it out?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/81/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/81/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
