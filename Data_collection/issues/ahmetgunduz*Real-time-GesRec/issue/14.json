Do you trained separability the two models? detection & classification\r\n2. Can I use the jester dataset to train the two models? (something that confuses me is that one of the classes in the jester dataset is 'no gesture'? \r\n3. As I understand you used the same code in the main.py to train separability the two models?\r\n4. If so, what do I need to change to switch between the training of the two models? excepts the network parameters? \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nOlga","closed_by":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
