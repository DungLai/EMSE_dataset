Could you please give me some advice? And Could you please share some details for your ego finetuning experiment details?(lr? freeze some layers? freeze bn?)\r\n  My own gesture dataset has 88 classes, almost the union of jester gesture class and ego gesture class. And only a few samples per class, (train: 42 samples, val: 6 samples). The dataset is small and with distortion(wide angle camera), second person perspective, and similar with jester.\r\n  \r\n  In my experiment, the arch of trained model is resnet34_0.5channels (4 block layers: [3, 4, 6, 3]). Here are results:\r\na. only train fc layer, all conv and bn are frozen, lr 0.001, dropout 0.7, performance: train 0.573, val: 0.463\r\nb. block layer4 and fc, conv1 and layer1~3(include bn) are frozen , lr 0.01, dropout 0.7, performance: train 0.743, val: 0.447\r\nc. entire model, large lr 0.01 due to my bug, no dropout, but the model got best performance: train0.909, val0.582\r\nd. train from scratch, lr 0.01, dropout 0.7, performance: train 0.712, val 0.329\r\n\r\nI also found the pretrained model from jester may predict some `swiping` case in my own dataset as `sliding` due to distortion.\r\n\r\nIt seems the model has not benefit much from finetuning due to more classes than jester and distortion. Could you give me some advice?\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
