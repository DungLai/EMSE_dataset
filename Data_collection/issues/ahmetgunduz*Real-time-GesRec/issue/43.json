My accuracy for this dataset is very poor (not even 20%). Can you explain whether the model is correct one to test and if yes than why the prediction accuracy is so poor.\r\nI have followed the steps mentioned by you in your github post.","closed_by":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
