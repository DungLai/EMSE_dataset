I'm a newbie at this (studied the theory, trying to learn how to put it into practice!) and I'm hoping you can help with a simple request.\r\n\r\nI'd like to run the EgoGesture set through the ResNext101 pretrained network to see it perform gesture classification. I've downloaded the egogesture_resnext_101_Depth_32.pth pretrained model from your link, and I have recently downloaded the EgoGesture data set. How would I go about running the network on the dataset so that I can see the results?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
