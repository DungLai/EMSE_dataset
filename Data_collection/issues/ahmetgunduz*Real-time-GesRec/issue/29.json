However, I am a beginner in pytorch. So, I need some help to go through the code:\r\n\r\n1. I plan to feed the model with depth images, which is achieved form the camera with openni and opencv. The shape of each frame is (112,112,3). If I want to detect and classify n frames in each iteration, what shape should the input be.\r\n\r\n2. What does \"sample_duration\" mean? What is the difference between \"sample_duration_det\" and detector queue.\r\n\r\nI am using egogesture depth model.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
