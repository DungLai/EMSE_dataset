I am using your pretrained models nv_resnext_101_Depth_32.pth for Classifier and nv_resnetl_10_Depth_8.pth' for Detector. The modality is Depth (also changed it in dataset.py, by default it was RGB-D and the error below showed 3 channels instead of 0)\r\nI'm stuck on this error:\r\n`Start Evaluation\r\n[1/482]============\r\nC:\\Users\\marcw\\Desktop\\Real-time-GesRec-master\\data2\\nvGesture\\Video_data\\class_01\\subject13_r0\\sk_depth_all\r\n[INFO]: Videot  is loading...\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:/Users/marcw/Desktop/Real-time-GesRec-master/online_test.py\", line 250, in <module>\r\n    outputs_det = detector(inputs_det)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\marcw\\anaconda3\\envs\\opencv4\\lib\\site-packages\\torch\\nn\\modules\\module.py\", line 532, in __call__\r\n    result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\marcw\\Desktop\\Real-time-GesRec-master\\models\\resnetl.py\", line 175, in forward\r\n    x = self.conv1(x)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\marcw\\anaconda3\\envs\\opencv4\\lib\\site-packages\\torch\\nn\\modules\\module.py\", line 532, in __call__\r\n    result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\marcw\\anaconda3\\envs\\opencv4\\lib\\site-packages\\torch\\nn\\modules\\conv.py\", line 479, in forward\r\n    return F.conv3d(input, self.weight, self.bias, self.stride,\r\nRuntimeError: Given groups=1, weight of size 16 1 7 7 7, expected input[1, 0, 16, 112, 112] to have 1 channels, but got 0 channels instead`\r\n\r\nRight before that console shows details of models 1 and 2.
