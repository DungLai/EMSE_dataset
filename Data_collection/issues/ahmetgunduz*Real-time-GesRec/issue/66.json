How can I solve this?\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to ask the following, can detector also use depth to train? If not, how to train the RGB model of detector?\r\n\r\nHere are the parameters I used in training, and I put opt.py No in_ Train and no_ Val changed to true, I don't know if it is modified like this, right?\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\npython3 main.py \\\r\n\t--root_path ~/ \\\r\n\t--video_path /dataset/EGO \\\r\n\t--annotation_path /Real-time-GesRec/annotation_EgoGestur/egogestureall_but_None.json \\\r\n\t--result_path Real-time-GesRec/results \\\r\n\t--pretrain_path /Real-time-GesRec/models/egogesture_resnext_101_Depth_32.pth \\\r\n\t--dataset egogesture \\\r\n\t--sample_duration 32 \\\r\n        --learning_rate 0.01 \\\r\n        --model resnext \\\r\n\t--model_depth 101 \\\r\n\t--resnet_shortcut B \\\r\n\t--batch_size 1 \\\r\n\t--n_classes 83 \\\r\n\t--n_finetune_classes 83 \\\r\n\t--n_threads 16 \\\r\n\t--checkpoint 1 \\\r\n\t--modality Color \\\r\n\t--train_crop random \\\r\n\t--n_val_samples 1 \\\r\n\t--test_subset test \\\r\n        --n_epochs 100 \\\r\n        --no_train \\\r\n        --no_val \\\r\n       --test \\","closed_by":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
