But I found it's almost not fitting, after tens of epoch, the acc for trainset and valset is about 5%.\r\nAnd I tried to increase batchsize to 16, the acc can however converged to 9%, it's still very low. I also tried to set norm_value=255 to normalize the input data to small range or smaller lr, but it didn't work.\r\nDid I miss something?\r\nBTW, the detector trained from scratch is well with acc about 80%.
