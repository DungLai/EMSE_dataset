I am only trying to train the detector half of the network for now and using the JESTER dataset to do so.\r\n\r\n1. How is the data getting fed in? Each folder has 'n' frames which belong to a category(i.e. gesture or no gesture). Taking the detector queue as 8 frames, do you then split the 'n' frames into n/8 chunks each having the gesture or no gesture label?\r\n2. How long did you pre-train it on JESTER for? You paper mentions 25 epochs but I am guessing that'd for the classifier? Your code seems to indicate 100 epochs instead.\r\n\r\nI am hoping you can help me with this. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNishant Bhattacharya","closed_by":{"login":"nishantb21","id":19548448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19548448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantb21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantb21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
