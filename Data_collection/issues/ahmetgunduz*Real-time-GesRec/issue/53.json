So for inferencing pupose I am running run_online.sh file by putting both checkpoints there. So for that I have made Jester_online.py file just like you made egogesture_online.py to get the dataset to provide for evaluation but it is showing some reshape error in the following line -\r\nclip = torch.cat(clip, 0).view((self.sample_duration, -1) + im_dim).permute(1, 0, 2, 3)\r\nthe error is - \r\nRuntimeError: shape '[32, -1, 112, 112]' is invalid for input of size 865536\r\n\r\nFor simple classification, I didn't get this error.
