thanks so much, Ahmet. It works when I changed n_classes to 27. I also figured it out a few days ago.\r\nBut I came across another problem. The accuracy of my model is very poor. I trained the model using the pretrained Jester model as pretrain_path for 100 epochs.  Training accuracy is about 0.006. Then I continued to train the model using the saved model as resume_path for 100 epochs. But the accuracy does not improve. The paper said \"After pretraining on Jester dataset, training is completed after 5 more epochs\". So it must be somewhere I missed it.\r\nThe same thing happens for the training of detector. I trained the detector without pretrained model for 100 epochs. But the test accuracy is about 0.5.\r\nCould you please give me any suggestions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/611753175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wxjames","id":33444066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDQ0MDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33444066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames","html_url":"https://github.com/wxjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/612550303","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/50#issuecomment-612550303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/50","id":612550303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjU1MDMwMw==","user":{"login":"wxjames","id":33444066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDQ0MDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33444066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames","html_url":"https://github.com/wxjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxjames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-12T02:02:48Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T02:02:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Train.log

I think the location and the process of dataset should be good because the code runs well when testing is conducted and using the pretrained EgoGesture model as resume_path. But when I do the transfer learning using the pretrained Jester model, the accuracy would just not increase. \r\n\r\nMaybe it is caused by these: when I first run the code, the error occurs saying \"RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 784.00 MiB (GPU 0; 11.89 GiB total capacity; 10.58 GiB already allocated; 187.56 MiB free; 10.60 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch).\" and \"RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad and does not have a grad_fn\". \r\n\r\nSo I added 2 rows of codes in train.py like this:\r\n\r\n        with torch.no_grad():\r\n            outputs = model(inputs)\r\n        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)\r\n        loss = Variable(loss, requires_grad=True)\r\n\r\nThe first and the last lines are the codes I added. After that, the code could be conducted successfully. I think this may cause the loss function cannot decrease. \r\n\r\nBelow is the information of my CUDA. Could you help me with that? Or should I increase my CUDA memory?\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-17
