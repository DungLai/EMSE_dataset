It should give you an idea. \r\n\r\nBesides please see my answers below:\r\n> I plan to feed the model with depth images, which is achieved form the camera with openni and opencv. The shape of each frame is (112,112,3). If I want to detect and classify n frames in each iteration, what shape should the input be.\r\nI see that you are somehow reading wrong channels. (112,112,3) image has to form of (`height`, `width`, `channel`) and your channel is 3. So it is either RGB or it is not properly casted to Depth image. What I would recommend is to use [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to format your image after reading with opencv. See modes in PIL for more information. https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.1.x/handbook/concepts.html#modes \r\nAnd shape of a frame for depth model must be (1, 1, 1, 112, 112) `torch.Tensor` , which is annotated as (`batch size`, `channel`, `sample duration`, `height`, `width`). `sample size` is for the number of frames basically\r\n\r\n> What does \"sample_duration\" mean? What is the difference between \"sample_duration_det\" and detector queue.\r\n\r\nIt is the number of the frames in a video clip. `*_det` and `*_clf` are  annotations for detector and classifier architecture, respectively.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense,\r\nAhmet

I reshape this list A to (1,1,32,112,112), and call this as total_frames.\r\ntotal_frames = np.reshape(total_sample, (1, 1, sample_duration_clf, 112, 112))\r\n4.I took the last eight pieces of data and put them into the detector.\r\ninputs_det = torch.from_numpy(total_frames).float()[:,:,-sample_duration_det:,:,:,]\r\noutputs_det = detector(inputs_det)\r\n5.
