This is sth I should have included in the repo. Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nFirst, you need to create two sub folders  for RGB and Depth videos, seperately. For your example above it would be like this `Video_data/class_01/subject1_r0/sk_color_all` or `Video_data/class_01/subject1_r0/sk_depth_all`\r\n\r\nThen, all frames from the avi files with the same name need to be extracted into these folders. \r\nThe code should be sth like below. Please make sure that you have ffmpeg installed if it is not already. Instructions in this [site](https://tecadmin.net/install-ffmpeg-on-linux/) should be enough. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do not have the access to the dataset anymore so I cannot test the code below but it should work. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom subprocess import call\r\nimport glob\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nvideo_types = [\"color\", \"depth\"]\r\nfor vt in video_types:\r\n    files = glob.glob(os.path.join(\"Video_data\", \"*\", \"*\", \"sk_\" + vt + \".avi\")) # this line should be updated according to the full path \r\n    for file in files:\r\n        directory = file.split(\".\")[0] + \"_all\"\r\n        if not os.path.exists(directory):\r\n            os.makedirs(directory)\r\n        call([\"ffmpeg\", \"-i\",  file, os.path.join(directory, \"%05d.jpg\"), \"-hide_banner\"]) # it should be 5 digit number because in nv.py it is assumed to be like so\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if that works.
