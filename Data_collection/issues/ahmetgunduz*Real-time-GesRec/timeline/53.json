assume the issue above is solved? \r\n\r\nRegarding `None` in the online_test.py you must understand what temporal transform actually is. Temporal transformation is used to force the number of the input frames be equal to the `sample_duration`. Not all the video clips have equal number of frames. For example,  when you have a clip of size 69 frames as stated above you must select 32 of them and fed to the model. There are many ways to select 32 of them and temporal transformation does exactly this. You can either select 32 frames in the center of the clips, or select a random region of the clip. \r\n\r\nAbout your question, you are doing inference in real time. This means that you will have a sliding window of size 32. So you do not need to do a temporal selection since you are sliding a window of size 32 already. That is why it is None in online case. \r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nAhmet","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/618686913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/618824852","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/53#issuecomment-618824852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/53","id":618824852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODgyNDg1Mg==","user":{"login":"Agrawalchitranshu","id":21341582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzQxNTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu","html_url":"https://github.com/Agrawalchitranshu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Agrawalchitranshu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-24T06:17:12Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T06:17:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, I understand this, I am eactly doing the same thing but why am I getting that error, that is my question, Do I have to apply temporal transformation compulsarily while inferencing?
