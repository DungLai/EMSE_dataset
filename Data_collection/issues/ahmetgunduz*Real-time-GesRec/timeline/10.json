Think of this like x asis of the function \r\n`pre_predict` whether it is predicted early or not\r\n`finished_prediction` when state goes from active to passive this parameter set is true. It triggers predict when gesture ends\r\n`prev_active` state in the previous iteration. I use this to be able to detect the trasition of the `active` parameter\r\n\r\nAre you using nvGesture dataset? If that is the case each video has only one gesture and sometimes it does not have `no gesture` frames at the end of video so you have to add some frames(I used 16) from the beginning of the data so that detector could have enough time to deactivate the classifier.  This is not included in the code since it is a spesific property of Nvidia Gesture dataset. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/485456454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2305465899,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMwNTQ2NTg5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/events/2305465899","actor":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-28T21:21:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
