@sanaz97 ,\r\n\r\nThose `json`s are simply for saving the parameters where you specified for `classifier` and `detector` architectures. It does not used in the code. You do not need to worry about them unless you want to rerun the test with exactly the same settings you may use them as reference for yourself. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to run these models with a wabcam but that will require different data loading procedure. Please check opencv specifically `cv2.VideoCapture()` method. And with a quick search I found this [medium blog](https://medium.com/@jinilcs/a-simple-keras-model-on-my-laptop-webcam-dda77521e6a0) where it explain how to run a keras model on webcam video. As long as you capture the data from webcam and cast the frames into `torch.FloatTensor` you can run your model like `online_test.py` **with different data loading**.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/492430596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2341599262,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0MTU5OTI2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/events/2341599262","actor":{"login":"sanaz97","id":46787472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Nzg3NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46787472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97","html_url":"https://github.com/sanaz97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-14T22:16:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2341599263,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDE1OTkyNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/events/2341599263","actor":{"login":"sanaz97","id":46787472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Nzg3NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46787472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97","html_url":"https://github.com/sanaz97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanaz97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-14T22:16:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/492933337","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/17#issuecomment-492933337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/17","id":492933337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjkzMzMzNw==","user":{"login":"sathiez","id":42836206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODM2MjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42836206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez","html_url":"https://github.com/sathiez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T06:20:05Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T06:20:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,
