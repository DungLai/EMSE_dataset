\r\nI would check the models ability in detecting  gesture `pos gestures` against `neg gestures` before using an architecture as a detector as well. Also if you are using the same architecture as cls and det, there is no need to use detector  + classifier hierarchical setup. THis is because, you get the prediction of the models twice and there is no need for that. If I were you , I would train a simpler architecture (like resnetl) for a binary detection of gestures, `GESTURE` or `NO_GESTURE`. Then it makes sense. \r\n\r\nRegarding the threshold, you can do that easily by changing the if else statement under pre_predict case. But I do not think it will not be easy to find the optimum threshold and probably it will not perform better.
