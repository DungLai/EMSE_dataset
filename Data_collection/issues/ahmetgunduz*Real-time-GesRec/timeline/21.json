There are two kinds of transformations needs to be done: a) Temporal and b) Spatial. Temporal transformation is for getting right amount of frames in right order.  On the other hand, spatial transformation is done to get the input image shape (width and height) right. Both has augmentation methods as well **but it is only for training**. You are interested only in inference I believe. In this case, you would need to follow the same transformation in https://github.com/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/blob/cec7050b3cea2d3ec33967a1552d2022b89d4166/offline_test.py#L100-L106\r\n\r\n2. Please follow the https://github.com/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/README.md and run_offline.sh has an example. \r\n\r\n3. It is since it is pytorch base object
