All of base classes and novel classes are from Jester, but both_acc is not high, the model confused for gesture shape but not motion, so the model may not robust for spatial gesture shape? And lack of robustness of spatial gesture shape also difficult to generalize without enough training. p.s. https://github.com/gidariss/FewShotWithoutForgetting\r\nb.

That might work.\r\n\r\nAbout zero-mean normalization, It is standard in image to do standardization (x-std)/mean. The important thing is you calculate the mean and std for your dataset correctly. If the these statistics of the  images from your camera are differs much (definition of the \"much\" in statistical sense, so it is not easy to measure), model would not be able to learn with less amount of the data. Remember that the normalization is just a preprocessing method for **faster training** and it makes difference when the data is small like your case. \r\n\r\nHope this helps! \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/492432972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahmetgunduz","id":16335853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM1ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16335853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetgunduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/comments/493067259","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/16#issuecomment-493067259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetgunduz/Real-time-GesRec/issues/16","id":493067259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzA2NzI1OQ==","user":{"login":"asdfqwer2015","id":26498687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDk4Njg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26498687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015","html_url":"https://github.com/asdfqwer2015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdfqwer2015/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T13:27:40Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T13:27:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"En, got it.
