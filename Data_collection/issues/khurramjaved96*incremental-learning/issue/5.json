In the trainer.py file, in the distillation loss section, the previous model giving features after passing through the softmax while the current model giving features by passing through log softmax. How we can compute the KL divergence between these two using the F.kl function?\r\nPlease check this. \r\n Thanks \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"khurramjaved96","id":7290703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTA3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7290703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96","html_url":"https://github.com/khurramjaved96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurramjaved96/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/khurramjaved96/incremental-learning/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/khurramjaved96/incremental-learning/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
