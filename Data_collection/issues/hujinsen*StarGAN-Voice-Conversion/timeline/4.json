The elements in each channel are normalized by the same mean and variance, this may cause the different speaker ids that attached to the layers  mixed , thus we loose speaker ids information. By the way, if the original paper  set batch size to 1, because there is just one speaker id information attached(can’t mix), the net will also works. In the  implementation, batch size is 8,in order to avoid the problem , so I  choose instance norm instead. I haven’t tried the layer norm or group norm.\r\n\r\n- mean as alternatives of product in D/C last layer\r\n\r\nI’m sorry aboult this problem because I don’t konw what the “product pooling layer” is. This problem confused me a lot, if you know how to implement this layer please notify me.\r\n\r\n- (in only C) max-pooling as alternatives of strided-Conv\r\n\r\nSorry about this too.The paper uses strided-Conv and have no padding information of each layer. Due to CNN’s trans constant, I found the classifier worked just ok.\r\n\r\nHopefully to  answer your issue completely.
