Any idea or guide on how could I solve this issue ? :) \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the time dedicated to this issue . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
