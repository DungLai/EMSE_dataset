I noticed that there is a different procedure to generate unit types for allied and enemy units. This results in units of the same type (inside SC2) to have different type IDs returned by `get_unit_type_id()` depending if they are allies or enemies. However, this only happens in some maps, while other maps keep consistent enemy type IDs for allies and enemies (I believe that by coincidence and not on purpose). For example:\r\n\r\n* in maps `2s3z` and `3s5z_vs_3s6z`, allied stalkers are represented (in one-hot encoding) as 10 and zealots as 01, while enemy stalkers are represented as 01 and zealots as 10.\r\n* In `MMM2`, Marauders, Marines and Medivacs are labeled as 001, 010 and 100 for both allied and enemy units.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why allied and enemy unit type IDs are treated differently? Would there be any side effects if they were to be handled in the same way?","closed_by":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
