SMAC has become an import benchmark for multi-agent RL.\r\n\r\nHere I have a code problem abut how to deploy a new map in SMAC.\r\n\r\n1. '1o_2r_vs_4r' map I have created.\r\n\r\n2. map_param_registry:\r\n`\"1o_2r_vs_4r\": {\r\n        \"n_agents\": 3,\r\n        \"n_enemies\": 4,\r\n        \"limit\": 50,\r\n        \"a_race\": \"Z\",\r\n        \"b_race\": \"Z\",\r\n        \"unit_type_bits\": 2,\r\n        \"map_type\": \"overload_roach\"\r\n    }`\r\n\r\n3. error:\r\n`UnboundLocalError: local variable 'type_id' referenced before assignment`\r\n\r\n4. So, what's the meaning of unit_type | type_id ?  And how to change these codes for my new map? Is ther any documention I can refer?\r\n5.   Would you mind point me in the right direction regarding this?
