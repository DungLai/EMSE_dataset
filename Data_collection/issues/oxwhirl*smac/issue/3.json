When I run ``python -m smac.examples.random_agents`` or the sample program from the README, nothing seems to show up. Can you help me figure out what might be going wrong?\r\n\r\nI am using Starcraft II v 4.7.1 and am on `7678571` in this repo. Here is the output when I run  ``python -m smac.examples.random_agents``. When I run ``python -m pysc2.bin.agent --map Simple64`` from pysc2 a window seems to pop up fine (the ``render interface disabled`` line also shows up there too when I can see a gui).\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed that nothing is showing up in ``~/StarCraftII/Replays``. Where does a replay show up? Thanks.\r\n\r\n```[bash]\r\nVersion: B70326 (SC2.2018Season4)\r\nBuild: Nov 27 2018 03:26:30\r\nCommand Line: '\"/home/esquires3/StarCraftII/Versions/Base70154/SC2_x64\" -listen 127.0.0.1 -port 20293 -dataDir /home/esquires3/StarCraftII/ -tempDir /tmp/sc-5lbi516w/ -displayMode 0 -windowwidt\r\nh 1920 -windowheight 1200 -windowx 50 -windowy 50 -eglpath libEGL.so'\r\nStarting up...\r\nStartup Phase 1 complete\r\nStartup Phase 2 complete\r\nAttempting to initialize EGL from file libEGL.so ...\r\nFailed to find EGL functions in library file!\r\nCreating stub renderer...\r\nListening on: 127.0.0.1:20293\r\nStartup Phase 3 complete.
