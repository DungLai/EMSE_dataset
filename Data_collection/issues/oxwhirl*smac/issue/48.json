A clear example can also work, but in general I guess it's hard to understand from Python code the exact types so I'm not sure whether it would be enough.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
