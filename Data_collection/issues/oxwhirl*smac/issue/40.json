In fact, I try to train the agents under the scenario 2m_vs_1z but I found that even the zealot is in the shooting range of our agents and it's attacked, its health keeps the same as before.  I think the health of zealot should reduce but it doesn't. So I wonder why the attack isn't effective as I imagined. I guess maybe there is an effective attack ratio or the zealot can dodge. Could you please explain this? Thanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"tania2333","id":41434645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDM0NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41434645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333","html_url":"https://github.com/tania2333","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tania2333/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/40/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
