And this situation happens especially in Maps with Protoss, which can regenerate shields. And I found in the map \"3s5z_vs_3s6z\" that the allies can learn a strategy to increase the reward without winning the game. Specifically, the allies can learn a pattern to injure the enemies a little and immediately run away from them by hiding in a corner and waiting the enemies to recover, and then repeat. However, the problem can be solved when modifying the reward function to this:\r\n\r\nif self.reward_only_positive:\r\n    reward = max(0, delta_enemy + delta_deaths)  # shield
