Each unit has a specific value at each point in time. You can print each unit's current cooldown by printing the values of `self.agents` in StarCraft II env. We store the maximum values of this property so that we normalize it in observations/global state (divide current cooldown by maximum cooldown). For new units, one you can print the current cooldown for many-many rollouts, get the maximum value, and then hardcode it in the `unit_max_cooldown` function. \r\n\r\nHope this helps.
