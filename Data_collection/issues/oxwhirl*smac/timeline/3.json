@esquires,\r\n\r\nMy sincere apologies for the late reply. Could you please specify which OS are you using? I'm certain that the older versions of pysc2 did not have a graphical component for SC2 on Linux. If there are any changes on their side and SC2 GUI can be turned on, I'll add the features in SMAC as well. Otherwise, the GUI should work fine on MacOS.\r\n\r\nThe replays should indeed appear in $SC2PATH/Replays directory. However, the random_agents script does not generate any replays.
