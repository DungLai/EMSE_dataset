Changing it should have a big impact on the policy.\r\n\r\n@keenranger what you can do is you can `import time` and put a `time.sleep(ms)` in the `step()` function of the StarCraft2Env. This is probably the fastest way watching the agents' performance. Alternatively, you can safe a replay and then rewatch it.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/601403138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3147182434,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE0NzE4MjQzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/3147182434","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-19T20:33:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3147182445,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE0NzE4MjQ0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/3147182445","actor":{"login":"keenranger","id":18392918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzkyOTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18392918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger","html_url":"https://github.com/keenranger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-19T20:33:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3147182450,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNDcxODI0NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/3147182450","actor":{"login":"keenranger","id":18392918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzkyOTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18392918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger","html_url":"https://github.com/keenranger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenranger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-19T20:33:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3147182458,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE0NzE4MjQ1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/3147182458","actor":{"login":"GJHall","id":22969068,"node_i
