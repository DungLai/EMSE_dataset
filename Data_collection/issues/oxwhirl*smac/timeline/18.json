So the allies are actually outnumbered. \r\n\r\nWhat is the exact command that you run? I can't see how this could be the case. W/o the training, agents cannot win most of the time, especially on a hard map such as 27m_vs_30m.\r\n\r\nYou can create your own custom maps and adjust the size of the opponent's army. As stated in the paper and documentation, the difficulty (e.g. sc_pb.VeryHard) doesn't have much effect on the opponent's policy on these maps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/548356867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2769955735,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc2OTk1NTczNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/2769955735","actor":{"login":"cu-rie","id":29081373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDgxMzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29081373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie","html_url":"https://github.com/cu-rie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cu-rie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-05T03:17:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
