The reason for this is that we don’t use regular SC2 units but rather slightly changed versions of them (which I name x_RL in the SC2 Editor) for allies. Basically, the default SC2 units have certain features which we wanted to disable for our RL agents. For instance, when a SC2 unit is under attack, it automatically starts attacking the units that is shooting at it. We wanted the RL agents to start shooting once they understand that it is necessary. What we’ve basically done is we copied the SC2 units in the Editor, changed 3 fields in their characteristics, and named it Unitname_RL (there is a paragraph about this at the Appendix of the SMAC paper). All of the SMAC maps feature such units for the ally team.
