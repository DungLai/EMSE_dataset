the SMAC paper I graphed the median and the 25-75% interval.\r\nEach run logs at slightly different timesteps, so you might need to do a small amount of linear interpolation between points in order to get the median (or mean) for the same timestep across runs (scipy has a function for this).\r\n\r\nThe data you're graphing is from the SMAC paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04043) which has a slightly different starcraft setup compared to the original QMIX paper (which that figure is from), and we also use a slightly different architecture for the mixing network that leads to much better
