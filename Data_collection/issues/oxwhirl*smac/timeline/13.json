was able to run the map but with few changes.\r\n\r\n1. For some reason the trigger that is supposed to create the Dark Templar was not doing see. No Dark Templar was being spawned. I'm not sure why this is the case. I've modified it to created a Colossus and it works now. Feel free to change this and try out new things.\r\n\r\n2. I've divided the spawn area into two spawn areas, one for the allied units and one for the enemy.\r\n\r\n3. I've also made some changes to the code, but I'm not sure if they were causing the error on your side. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I've created a new branch called `add_new_units` and pushed the changes in https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/commit/872739834211fa79be75f158b49619e65378f12c.

I tried to create a Colossus instead of a Dark Templar in my original map with the modification in the code as yours, and it works as well. \r\n\r\n2. The problem should be to do with the Dark Templar. It is invisible by default, and we need the Buff of the Overseer named \"Detector\" to see it. That's the reason why you may think the Dark Templar failed to spawn. Sorry for the late notification.\r\n\r\n3. Currently, SMAC may not work well with the invisible units. I only find the Dark Templar has this ability, and the Terrain Ghost needs to be upgraded to get this.
