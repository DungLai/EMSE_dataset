I'm aware of the issue and will fix it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, you can use an older version of SC2 by passing corresponding version to SMAC, e.g., `env = StarCraft2Env(map_name=\"3s5z\", game_version=\"4.6.2\")`.\r\n\r\n To check which versions of SC2 you have installed, check the `Versions` directory in SC2 dir. For instance, I have `Base60321 Base67926 Base69232 Base71663 Base74071` installed. You can use https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/master/pysc2/run_configs/lib.py to map these base numbers to StarCraft II versions.\r\n\r\n
