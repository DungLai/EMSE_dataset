I would've needed the exact last actions in order to sample the reward from the true \"payoff matrix\" (in game theory speak) but since the exact reward function is given I don't need them. That leads me to another task of getting all available actions for enemies, which may be simpler.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/662552082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nfitch3","id":15696626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Njk2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15696626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3","html_url":"https://github.com/nfitch3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfitch3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3576580322,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU3NjU4MDMyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/3576580322","actor":{"login":"douglasrizzo","id":2209364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDkzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2209364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo","html_url":"https://github.com/douglasrizzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-22T16:24:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3576580325,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1NzY1ODAzMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/3576580325","actor":{"login":"douglasrizzo","id":2209364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDkzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2209364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo","html_url":"https://github.com/douglasrizzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-22T16:24:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/662791941","html_url":"https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/issues/50#issuecomment-662791941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/50","id":662791941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mjc5MTk0MQ==","user":{"login":"douglasrizzo","id":2209364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDkzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2209364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo","html_url":"https://github.com/douglasrizzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-23T02:39:42Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T02:39:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nfitch3

few months ago, I talked in #28 about the possibility of providing the state as structured data, so that users can distinguish individual features from individual units and use them for their own purposes.\r\nIn this PR, I have implemented this by creating a method that provides the state as a Python dict, isolating allied and enemy unit types and features as well as the last actions of allied units. Basically, everything that was provided in the original state, but in a `dict`. The original `get_state()` method simply calls the new `get_state_dict()` method and organizes the information as was done previously.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have devised a way of providing the names of features in lists which are created when the environment is initialized and returned either as class attributes or in `get_env_info()`. These lists are created dynamically (e.g. depending on whether the user has chosen for previous actions to be present in the state, or if units have shields or not, these feature names are either present or not in the lists).\r\n\r\nI myself have been using these modifications for a few months, so I hope they are welcome.\r\n\r\nI also believe this partially addresses #50.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/667523597","html_url":"https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/issues/50#issuecomment-667523597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/50","id":667523597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzUyMzU5Nw==","user":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-01T12:22:36Z","updated_at":"2020-08-01T12:22:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Unfortunately, the actions of the enemies are not available to us via the sc2-proto.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/667523597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3611786284,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzYxMTc4NjI4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/3611786284","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-01T12:23:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
