Unfortunately, the older maps from the QMIX paper are incompatible with the current codebase (smac & pymarl). \r\n\r\nNonetheless, you can always create your own maps using the StarCraft 2 Editor by modifying the released .SC2Map files. I'd suggest taking a look at one of them (e.g., 3s_5z) and then adding the Colossus unit to it. This would require you to create a new \"Colossus RL\" unit (check out the second to last paragraph from [here](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/blob/master/docs/smac.md#environment-settings) for difference between \"RL\" and regular units). You would also need to make few changes in the starcraft.py file.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you are willing to do this. I'm happy to help if you have any questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/489738781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2321898190,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMyMTg5ODE5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/2321898190","actor":{"login":"saizhang0218","id":7425490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7425490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218","html_url":"https://github.com/saizhang0218","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-06T19:09:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2321898192,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMjE4OTgxOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/2321898192","actor":{"login":"saizhang0218","id":7425490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7425490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218","html_url":"https://github.com/saizhang0218","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saizhang0218/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-06T19:09:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T19:33:05Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T19:33:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/pymarl/issues/14","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/pymarl","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/pymarl/issues/14/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/pymarl/issues/14/comments","events_url":"https://api.githu
