Are you using the same conda environment for both SMAC and PySC2? SMAC's environment rendering code is completely decoupled from that of PySC2 (it's a completely different piece of code). So if you're not using PySC2's rendering with SMAC (which isn't used anywhere in SMAC), you could just have pygame>2.0.0 in smac conda environment? The thing is that pygame>2.0.0 is much faster compared to previous versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/886656983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/886721257","html_url":"https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/issues/79#issuecomment-886721257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/79","id":886721257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCdEVLM402krp","user":{"login":"douglasrizzo","id":2209364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDkzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2209364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo","html_url":"https://github.com/douglasrizzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-26T13:50:49Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T13:50:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The specific problem I had was that I was unable to watch replays, as taught in the SMAC README (https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac#watching-a-replay) right after installing SMAC.
