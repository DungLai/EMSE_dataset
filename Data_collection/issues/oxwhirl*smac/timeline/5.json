Thanks for your interest in our work.\r\n\r\nI believe these are from the *get_obs_agent* function which returns observations of agent i. The observation of each agent includes information about the allied units (ally_feats), enemy units (enemy_feats), features relating to moving, such as whether the agent can go left, right, etc (move_feats), and information about the agent itself (own_feats), such as the agent's health or type. Basically, *feats* is short for *features*.\r\n\r\nIn the end of the function these 4 features vectors are flattened and concatenated yielding the observation of agent i.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/481631731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2265592493,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI2NTU5MjQ5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/2265592493","actor":{"login":"TimeBreaker","id":22141799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTQxNzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22141799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker","html_url":"https://github.com/TimeBreaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-10T10:18:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2265592494,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNjU1OTI0OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/2265592494","actor":{"login":"TimeBreaker","id":22141799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTQxNzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22141799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker","html_url":"https://github.com/TimeBreaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimeBreaker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-10T10:18:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2265983431,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNjU5ODM0MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/2265983431","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-10T12:52:57Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/481995772","html_url":"https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/issues/5#issuecomment
