The problem is that the code is trying to get a color option that is higher that what exists in the color pallet. In line 304, there is an if statement \"if self.clip:\" that will clip the values in the variable 'plane' so that this error won't happen. It looks like self.clip was never set to True so the code doesn't actually clip it. My solution was to just set clip to True so that the values are clipped and the indexError does not occur. Not sure if this is the best fix or not but it worked for me. I don't see why you wouldn't always want to clip anyways to prevent this error from happening.

there. I am working with [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac), a package that has pysc2 as a dependency. It introduces a few custom maps specialized in multi-agent RL.

If you can share some steps-by-steps guidelines to do video recording, it would be very nice. Or you can make a PR to SMAC, I think it is a very good enhancement for
