One could just write a dictionary/function that returns appropriate strings given these unit ids. Happy to accept the PR if this is something you want to add. :)\r\n\r\nHello, thanks for your excellent work.\r\n\r\nI have created an empty map and design several new RL units but not create the units in the map, and I want to create the RL unit after loading the  empty map in the smac as follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd = d_pb.DebugCommand(\r\n                    create_unit=d_pb.DebugCreateUnit(\r\n                        unit_type=unit_type,\r\n                        owner=owner,\r\n                        pos=pos,\r\n                        quantity=quantity))\r\nself._controller.debug(cmd)\r\n```\r\nHow can I get the unit_type of the uncreated RL unit？\r\n\r\nHope to receive your reply.

Then when you create a new unit using the SC2 Editor (you'd need to do this manually in advance), that unit receives the a new id equal to x+1. If you create 10 new units, they will receive ids from x+1 to x+10 sorted alphabetically using unit name. \r\n\r\nFor build version 75689 (4.10.0), x = 1969. For build version 82893 (5.0.5), x = 2004. For other versions, you'd need to create a new unit using SC2 Editor, print its unit_type and identify the exact number.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\nFeel free to reopen the issue if there are further questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/967035440/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5609091272,"node_id":"CE_lADOCdEVLM429OPRzwAAAAFOU_DI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/5609091272","actor":{"login":"samvelyan","id":9724413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9724413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan","html_url":"https://github.com/samvelyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samvelyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-12T11:38:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5609091296,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCdEVLM429OPRzwAAAAFOU_Dg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/5609091296","actor":{"login":"liushunyu","id":30792664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzkyNjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30792664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu","html_url":"https://github.com/liushunyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-12T11:38:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5609091300,"node_id":"SE_lADOCdEVLM429OPRzwAAAAFOU_Dk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/events/5609091300","actor":{"login":"liushunyu","id":30792664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzkyNjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30792664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu","html_url":"https://github.com/liushunyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liushunyu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-12T11:38:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/comments/967145271","html_url":"https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/issues/73#issuecomment-967145271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/73","id":96714527
