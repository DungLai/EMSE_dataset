I haven't played with the fog options a lot, so cannot comment on that unfortunately.\r\n\r\n@ReinholdM, you can add different points and change the unit spawn locations in the `Triggers` menu, as @Duke-Allen described. If you open any SMAC map, you'll see that we're spawning units on a fixed Point. Usually everyone is being spawned on the same group Point. However, you can change the triggers and spawn individual units at different locations (you just have to create those points on the map in advance). \r\n\r\nHope this is helpful!
