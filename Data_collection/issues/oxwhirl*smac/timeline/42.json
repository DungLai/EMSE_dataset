Since I'm new to Ray/Rllib I started with the \"TwoStepGame\" example the libary provides as an example on there github repo (https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/twostep_game.py), trying to understand how to use it. Since for the start this example was a little bit to complex for me I adjusted it to make a example that is as simple as possible. Problem: Qmix doesn't seem to learn, means the resulting reward pretty much matches the expected value of a random policy.\r\n\r\nLet me explain the idea of my very simple experiment. We have 2 agents. Every agent can make 3 actions (`Discrete(3)`). If he makes the action 0 he gets a reward of 0.5 if not 0. So this should be a very simple task, since the best policy is just taking action 0.\r\n\r\nHere is my implementation:\r\n\r\n<!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false -->\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-python -->\r\n\r\n    from gym.spaces import Tuple, MultiDiscrete, Dict, Discrete\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n\r\n    import ray\r\n    from ray import tune\r\n    from ray.tune import register_env, grid_search\r\n    from ray.rllib.env.multi_agent_env import MultiAgentEnv\r\n    from ray.rllib.agents.qmix.qmix_policy import ENV_STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n    class TwoStepGame(MultiAgentEnv):\r\n        action_space = Discrete(3)\r\n\r\n        def __init__(self, env_config):\r\n            self.counter = 0\r\n\r\n        def reset(self):\r\n            return {0: {'obs': np.array([0]), 'state': np.array([0])},\r\n                    1: {'obs': np.array([0]), 'state': np.array([0])}}\r\n\r\n        def step(self, action_dict):\r\n            self.counter += 1\r\n            move1 = action_dict[0]\r\n            move2 = action_dict[1]\r\n            reward_1 = 0\r\n            reward_2 = 0\r\n            if move1 == 0:\r\n                reward_1 = 0.5\r\n            if move2 == 0:\r\n                reward_2 = 0.5\r\n\r\n            obs = {0: {'obs': np.array([0]), 'state': np.array([0])},\r\n                   1: {'obs': np.array([0]), 'state': np.array([0])}}\r\n            done = False\r\n            if self.counter > 100:\r\n                self.counter = 0\r\n                done = True\r\n\r\n            return obs, {0: reward_1, 1: reward_2}, {\"__all__\": done}, {}\r\n\r\n\r\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n\r\n        grouping = {\"group_1\": [0, 1]}\r\n\r\n        obs_space = Tuple([\r\n            Dict({\r\n                \"obs\": MultiDiscrete([2]),\r\n                ENV_STATE: MultiDiscrete([3])\r\n            }),\r\n            Dict({\r\n                \"obs\": MultiDiscrete([2]),\r\n                ENV_STATE: MultiDiscrete([3])\r\n            }),\r\n        ])\r\n\r\n        act_space = Tuple([\r\n            TwoStepGame.action_space,\r\n            TwoStepGame.action_space,\r\n        ])\r\n\r\n        register_env(\"grouped_twostep\",\r\n            lambda config: TwoStepGame(config).with_agent_groups(\r\n                grouping, obs_space=obs_space, act_space=act_space))\r\n\r\n        config = {\r\n            \"mixer\": grid_search([\"qmix\"]),\r\n            \"env_config\": {\r\n                \"separate_state_space\": True,\r\n                \"one_hot_state_encoding\": True\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ray.init(num_cpus=1)\r\n        tune.run(\r\n            \"QMIX\",\r\n            stop={\r\n                \"timesteps_total\": 100000,\r\n            },\r\n            config=dict(config, **{\r\n                \"env\": \"grouped_twostep\",\r\n            }),\r\n        )\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- end snippet -->\r\n\r\n\r\nand here is the result of the output when I run it for 100 000 timesteps\r\n\r\n<!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false -->\r\n\r\n    +----------------------------+------------+-------+---------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+\r\n    | Trial name                 | status     | loc   | mixer   |   iter |   total time (s) |     ts |   reward |\r\n    |----------------------------+------------+-------+---------+--------+------------------+--------+----------|\r\n    | QMIX_grouped_twostep_00000 | TERMINATED |       | qmix    |    100 |          276.796 | 101000 |   33.505 |\r\n    +----------------------------+------------+-------+---------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Process finished with exit code 0\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- end snippet -->\r\n\r\nAs you can see the policy seems to be random since the expected value is 1/3 and the resulting reward is 33.505 (because I reset the enviroment every 100 timesteps).\r\nMy Question: What do i not understand? There must be something wrong with my configuration or maybe my understanding of how rllib works. But since the best policy is very very simpel (just always take action 0) it seems to me like this algorithm cannot learn.\r\n\r\n\r\nsoftware | version\r\n--- | ---\r\nray |0.8.4\r\npython | 3.6.9\r\ntensorflow | 1.14.0\r\nOS |  Ubuntu (running in a VM on a Windows OS) Release 18.04\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ray-project/ray/issues/8384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ray-project/ray/issues/8384/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
