One key difference between the default PyMARL implementation and rllib implementation of QMIX for SMAC is that PyMARL uses the true overall global state but rllib only uses the per-agent observation as the global state in the monotonic mixing network. So you'd need to modify the default implementation and extract the true global state from the environment so that the mixing network can use it.
