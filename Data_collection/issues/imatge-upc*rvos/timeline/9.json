We have generated the masks and these have been always evaluated in the official evaluation server, from either DAVIS or YouTube-VOS. However, you can implement it based on the evaluation code available in DAVIS in Matlab and Python in the following website: https://davischallenge.org/davis2017/code.html\r\nIf you want to use the official evaluation servers, you need to use the code ```src/prepare_results_submission.py```(for YouTube-VOS) or ```src/prepare_results_submission_davis.py```for DAVIS, which generates a folder that once compressed can be sent to the evaluation servers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/comments/485808581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"carlesventura","id":7792351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTIzNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7792351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura","html_url":"https://github.com/carlesventura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlesventura/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/comments/486579084","html_url":"https://github.com/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/9#issuecomment-486579084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/9","id":486579084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjU3OTA4NA==","user":{"login":"z-lan","id":45734673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzM0Njcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45734673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan","html_url":"https://github.com/z-lan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/z-lan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T08:52:25Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T08:52:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see.
