I notice that in Table 4 of your paper, both J and F of OSNM are much lower than those reported in OSMN (37.7 vs 52.5 for J mean, 44.9 vs 57.1 for F mean). I wonder whether these \"J\" and \"F\" in your Table 4 mean \"J mean\" and \"F mean\".  If yes, why are they so much lower than these reported in original paper? \r\nThe fowllowing are results on DAVIS-2017 from your paper and OSMN.\r\n### Your results:\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17945632/54587129-1ddc4e00-4a5a-11e9-8d10-b6d059c4cd0a.png)\r\n### OSMN results:\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17945632/54586922-65aea580-4a59-11e9-917a-0be0df03ca4f.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"agirbau","id":23292221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjkyMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23292221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau","html_url":"https://github.com/agirbau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirbau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
