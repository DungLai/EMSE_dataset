Thank you for sharing the code.\r\nI was wondering if you'd be kind enough and explain to me/point me to the code on how starting_frame is set.\r\n\r\nI was trying to train my own data (the format of which is similar to YoutubeVOS, not all video sequences start from 00000.jpg, some start from 00001.jpg). When I try to train it, I sometimes get FileNotFound error potentially due to this index mixup. But I have a hard time understanding how starting_frame is set when the youtube dataset is made.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know. Thank you so much for your help.
