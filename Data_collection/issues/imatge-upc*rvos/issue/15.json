Are there any other settings or tricks during training and testing? I found data argumentation is used in training while not in testing, and I absolutely did as the public settings. The models are trained for 50 epochs  on a single TitanX GPU (batch_size=4, clips=5). The following is the retrained results:\r\n\r\nretrain-RVOS-T:  33.87,   18.37,  38.62,  22.23\r\n\r\nretrain-RVOS-S: 38.52,    18.72,    41.70,     22.59\r\n\r\nretrain-RVOS-ST:  41.56,      21.46,     45.00,     24.52 \r\n\r\nBesides I also used the public zero shot youtube model for youtube-vos testing, I got the following scores:\r\npub-RVOS-ST:   43.39, \t21.10,    45.30,     24.32.\r\n\r\nIt seems the inferior retrain results are not due to the test settings, but I do not know why, can you help me?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imatge-upc/rvos/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
