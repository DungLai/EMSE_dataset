Can I control the number of next points I get in each iteration of manual loop? I can see there is [batch_size argument](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/blob/37473dd20b53f2f871bc82ff2358d483e4b43970/emukit/bayesian_optimization/loops/bayesian_optimization_loop.py#L34) in the GitHub code but it doesn't seem available in the version installed with pip. \r\n\r\n2. Is external objective evaluation mode [introduced for BO](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amzn/emukit/blob/master/notebooks/Emukit-tutorial-bayesian-optimization-external-objective-evaluation.ipynb) supported in Experimental Design as well? \r\n\r\nThank you.
