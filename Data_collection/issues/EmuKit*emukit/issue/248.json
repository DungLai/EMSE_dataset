However, I have a couple of issues with this loop.\r\n\r\nFirst, when I initialize the loop with two gpy models and try to run it with \"run_loop\", I found the error \"Y_constraint not found in results object\". Tracing back to the function, I am wondering is there anything wrong with the create_loop_state function called in UnknownConstraintBayesianOptimizationLoop constructor.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since run_loop only takes the objective function as a input, it can only update the objective model. However, from my understanding for the https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5607 paper, the constraint model should also be updated with each iteration when a new constrained value calculated, but I don't see a implementation on this. Therefore, I am wondering that whether this part has not be implemented yet or I misunderstood it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
