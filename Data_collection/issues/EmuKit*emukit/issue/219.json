Both are used essentially as just input generator utilities, and aren't used anywhere inside the library. We cannot even argue them to be a core part of emukit itself, as, like said above, they are just thin wrappers around something else.\r\n\r\nI am going to argue that there is nothing they actually contribute to emukit. We already have random elsewhere, and Latin is a small bit of a well-design library pyDOE which our users may use if they so wish. We can even point them to it in the docs. So I suggest we remove these, and leave experimental_design package like that:\r\n\r\nexperimental_design\r\n|_ interfaces\r\n|_ acquisitions\r\n|_ experimental_design_loop.py\r\n\r\nessentially removing the whole model free/model based dichotomy from the library.","closed_by":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
