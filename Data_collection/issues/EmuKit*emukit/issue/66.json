When writting the blogs for the methods it is very important that we send an clear message of how the library should be used. For the examples involving loops (BO, ED, BQ) this is what I propose:\r\n\r\n- In all the cards in the landing page we explain the idea of the method that each card links to and we add a simple example with code.\r\n- We use the same objective function and the same pattern in all the examples.\r\n- All the examples use specific methods-loops and have the same structure.\r\n\r\n1. Definition of the objective function (same in all examples)\r\n2. Definition of the model (same in all examples)\r\n3. Definition of the elements specific of each method (this changes across examples).\r\n4. Creation of the loop (also specific).\r\n5. Run the loop and show results (same).\r\n\r\nThe code for 1, 2, and 5 should be the same in all the examples. \r\n\r\nSensitivity analysis will also use 1 and 2 but as there is no loop the results with be directly shown (specific call to 5).\r\n\r\nThe multi-fidelity are just models that we offer. The way to go here is to use do 1 and 2 for some example and then repeat 3-5 for one of the other applications (ED?).\r\n\r\nIt is important that we don't use any class from the /examples folder (like GPBayesianOptimization) as the idea with this blogpost is to show the modularity of the library and be clear about the core structure. We can have a separate card for examples and how to wrap things up.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javiergonzalezh","id":6853363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6853363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh","html_url":"https://github.com/javiergonzalezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
