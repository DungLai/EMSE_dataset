These are, among others:\r\n- Some latex formulas are not rendered correctly\r\n- For some classes, the parameter descriptions are not rendered at all as the docstring is split. The parameter descriptions need to be moved to the right place. Example:\r\n\r\n  This will *not* render the description of `my_param`:\r\n  ```\r\n  class MyCass:\r\n      \"\"\"This is my class.\"\"\"\r\n  \r\n      def __init__(self, my_parameter):\r\n          \"\"\"\r\n          :param my_parameter: Description of parameter.\r\n          \"\"\"\r\n  ```\r\n  This will :\r\n  ```\r\n  class MyCass:\r\n      \"\"\"This is my class.\r\n\r\n    :param my_parameter: Description of parameter.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n  \r\n      def __init__(self, my_parameter):\r\n        ...\r\n  ```\r\n- `:raises: ExcetionType` are partially not documented.\r\n- `.. note::` and `.. seealso::` is not used even though a note is present in the docstring.\r\n- Sentences are incomplete, e.g., dots `.` are missing, or they start without a capital letter. \r\n- There are inconsistencies in naming. For example sometimes the number of points are called `num_points` and sometimes `n_points`, or the number of input dimensions are sometimes called `num_dim` and sometimes `input_dim`. This is confusing to users.\r\n- Some docstrings do not exist or are incomplete\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nAnother thing that might be worth thinking about is to clean up the import structure and pulling some imports one level up (this may minorly break some code as imports change). For example instead of `from emukit.quadrature.loop.specific_loop import SpecificLoop` we should only have `from emukit.quadrature.loop import SpecificLoop`. It's more user friendly and the docs are cleaner.\r\n\r\nWe should probably go through the modules one by one and see if the issues are resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nModules docs that have been corrected\r\n\r\n- [ ] bayesian optimization\r\n- [ ] benchmarking\r\n- [ ] core\r\n- [ ] examples\r\n- [ ] experimental design\r\n- [ ] model wrappers\r\n    * [x] quadrature wrappers #413\r\n    * [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] multi fidelity\r\n- [x] quadrature #412\r\n- [ ] samplers\r\n- [ ] sensitivity\r\n- [ ] test functions\r\n    * [x] quadrature test functions #412\r\n    * [ ] ...\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
