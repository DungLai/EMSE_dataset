I'm trying to do BO Experimental Design, and have defined my parameter space as the following:\r\n\r\nparameter_space = ParameterSpace([DiscreteParameter('x1',np.linspace(0,1,11)),\r\n                                 DiscreteParameter('x2',np.linspace(0,1,11)),\r\n                                 DiscreteParameter('x3',np.linspace(0,1,11)),\r\n                                 DiscreteParameter('x4',np.linspace(0,1,11)),\r\n                                 DiscreteParameter('x5',np.linspace(0,1,11)),\r\n                                 DiscreteParameter('x6',np.linspace(0,1,11))])\r\n\r\nEssentially, a 6 column matrix with each [[0,0.1,0.2...1]] in spacing of 0.1.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to constrain this to have summation of x1 to x6 == 1. That is, only select x_new values to output a single vector but with the columns (x1 to x6) adding up to 1, rejecting any vector that does not meet this criteria.\r\n\r\nIs this possible to implement? I have looked into the constraint libraries but have come up short. If not using constraints, is their a way to explicitly define that space (it will be a shape(2121,6) matrix in the end). My understanding is that a matrix cannot be used, but only a 1d or 2d (n,1) array can be used.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
