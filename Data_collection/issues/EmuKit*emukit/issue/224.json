However, for example if the Branin or the Hartmann_3d benchmarks are used which have 3 fidelities the` X[1]` and `Y[1]` would correspond to the second fidelity. So, i think it would be `X[-1] `and` Y[-1]` as inputs for  `HighFidelityGp`.\r\n\r\n2\\ In `benchmarking_examples.ipynb `the inputs and outputs fidelities are given as lists which are later transformed using `convert_xy_lists_to_arrays` inside` baseline_model_wrappers.py` which merges the lists and adds a column with discrete values to `X` to distinguish the fidelities . However, in the sampling used in benchmarking_examples.ipynb with latin.get_samples a column is already added to the `X` of each fidelity corresponding to the InformationSourceParameter of the function. So i think there is no need in this case for this parameter since the sampling is used for each fidelity within its own list. \r\nActually we obtain `X` for two fidelities as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nX\r\n[array([[ 0.79166667,  0.29166667,  1.        ],\r\n       [ 0.95833333,  0.875     ,  1.        ],\r\n       [ 0.70833333,  0.625     ,  0.        ],\r\n       [ 0.125     ,  0.125     ,  0.        ],\r\n       [ 0.29166667,  0.45833333,  0.        ],\r\n       [ 0.45833333,  0.79166667,  1.        ],\r\n       [ 0.20833333,  0.54166667,  1.        ],\r\n       [ 0.375     ,  0.95833333,  0.        ],\r\n       [ 0.875     ,  0.20833333,  1.        ],\r\n       [ 0.04166667,  0.375     ,  0.        ],\r\n       [ 0.54166667,  0.70833333,  0.        ],\r\n       [ 0.625     ,  0.04166667,  1.        ]]), array([[ 0.5,  0.9,  0. ],\r\n       [ 0.1,  0.7,  1. ],\r\n       [ 0.9,  0.3,  0. ],\r\n       [ 0.7,  0.5,  1. ],\r\n       [ 0.3,  0.1,  0. ]])]\r\n```\r\nIt seems to me that here the last column does not give any additional information. And the information about which fidelity  is already in the list. Moreover, this can create modeling problem, because when using a model the function `convert_xy_lists_to_arrays` is used which will create the column corresponding to each fidelity hence having an `X` with four columns while the input dimension is only 2. Then the three first columns will be used for modeling the interactions within a fidelity  (including the third one).\r\n\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"marpulli","id":33632490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjMyNDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33632490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli","html_url":"https://github.com/marpulli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
