However, there are many cases, for example EIperSec, Fabolas, MTBO, .... , where one has two models: one for the objective function and one for the cost of evaluating the objective function.\r\nIt would be fairly straightforward to bootstrap from the already existing BayesianOptimizationLoop module to implement these methods. However, a cost sensitive loops seems to be a fundamental problem that might be also interesting for Bayesian quadrature or Experimental Design and I am wondering whether it makes sense to implement a general CostSensitiveOuterLoop class instead?
