I wonder if something like [this](https://gist.github.com/rvvincelli/6e72ab554f03c35e093fdfb1048be34f) is acceptable? The real question is what is the best way to keep track of the iterations, so the `t` variable; in this example we just override the `beta` property at each iteration, as `update_parameters` is the update hook called at the beginning of each iteration.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know!
