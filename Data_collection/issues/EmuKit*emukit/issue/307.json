I try to install the current version of emukit (0.4.7).\r\n\r\nI've have tried to install it multiple times, if you want to see the details or you need more information to my setup I've created a more detailed [gist](https://gist.github.com/johannesgiersdorf/217946aa1b0a1e03a38d509605cf312e). I have reproduced the bug as a sort of summary.\r\n\r\n# How to reproduce the bug\r\nWhat I wanted to do: I tried to install emukit via pip with the command ```pip install emukit``` that is suggested by the [README](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/blob/master/README.md) and the [Docs](https://emukit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)\r\n\r\nFirst I create a virtual environment and activate it (I use venv because the first install attempt did not  work out of the box, so I did not want to mess up my system and the [python packaging tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) suggested to do so)\r\n```\r\npython -m venv ./venv\r\nsource venv/bin/activate\r\n```\r\nThen I upgrade ```pip``` and install ```wheel``` (because the output of pip in previous attempts suggested to do so)\r\n```\r\npip install --upgrade pip\r\npip install wheel\r\n```\r\nThen I try to install emukit via ```pip```. For the bug report I logged ```stdout``` ```stderr```.\r\n```\r\npip install emukit 1>install_f.txt  2>error_install_f.txt\r\n```\r\nThe files containing the full output are attached. \r\n[error_install_f.txt](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/files/4742395/error_install_f.txt)\r\n[install_f.txt](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/files/4742396/install_f.txt)\r\n\r\nThe error occurs when pip is trying to install ```scipy==1.1.0``` (the fact that pip is trying to install exactly this version of ```scipy``` even if a newer is already installed even though emukit doesn't seem to [depend](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/blob/master/requirements/requirements.txt) on exactly this version I find odd).\r\nThe whole error is a very long. \r\n```\r\nError: Rank mismatch between actual argument at (1) and actual argument at (2) (scalar and rank-1)\r\n  21     scipy/sparse/linalg/eigen/arpack/ARPACK/SRC/znaitr.f:737:39:\r\n```\r\nErrors similar to the above line led me to assume it could be related to scipy/scipy#11611\r\n\r\nI have also tried to install ```numpy```, ```gpy``` and ```scipy``` before installing emukit. For details see [gist](https://gist.github.com/johannesgiersdorf/217946aa1b0a1e03a38d509605cf312e). \r\n\r\n# Version of python, pip and gcc \r\n```\r\n$ python -V\r\nPython 3.8.3\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ gcc -v\r\nUsing built-in specs.\r\nCOLLECT_GCC=gcc\r\nCOLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.1.0/lto-wrapper\r\nTarget: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\r\nConfigured with: /build/gcc/src/gcc/configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib --libexecdir=/usr/lib --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info --with-bugurl=https://bugs.archlinux.org/ --enable-languages=c,c++,ada,fortran,go,lto,objc,obj-c++,d --with-isl --with-linker-hash-style=gnu --with-system-zlib --enable-__cxa_atexit --enable-cet=auto --enable-checking=release --enable-clocale=gnu --enable-default-pie --enable-default-ssp --enable-gnu-indirect-function --enable-gnu-unique-object --enable-install-libiberty --enable-linker-build-id --enable-lto --enable-multilib --enable-plugin --enable-shared --enable-threads=posix --disable-libssp --disable-libstdcxx-pch --disable-libunwind-exceptions --disable-werror gdc_include_dir=/usr/include/dlang/gdc\r\nThread model: posix\r\nSupported LTO compression algorithms: zlib zstd\r\ngcc version 10.1.0 (GCC) \r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ pip -V   \r\npip 20.1.1 from /home/<username>/Documents/uni/bayesian-quadrature/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip list                     \r\nPackage    Version\r\n---------- -------\r\nnumpy      1.18.5\r\npip        20.1.1\r\nsetuptools 41.2.0\r\nwheel      0.34.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI appreciate any and all help.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/307/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
