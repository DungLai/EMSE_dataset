For the hyper-parameters of the multi-fidelity model, does emukit find them with the log-likelihood of the whole data (cheap and expensive samples) in one step or does it, as in the paper of Kennedy and O'Hagan (2000), first find the hyperparameters of the cheap kernel with the cheap data, then the scale and the hyperparameters of the error kernel with the difference between the expensive and cheap outputs at common points ? Is the Markov property automatically respected with the optimization of the multi-fidelity model in emukit ?\r\n\r\n2. I saw that in the notebook with multi-fidelity and bayesian optimization, you constrained the lengthscales between 0.01 and 0.5. Why did you do that ? Is it to avoid local optima of the likelihood for large lengthscales or is it because it may not make much sense to have large lengthscales for a domain size of 1 ? Would you have some tips on these constraints according to the domain size of the function ? \r\n\r\n3. If there are constraints on the lengthscales, are there cases where constraints on the variance (for the RBF kernels for example) should be applied ? Sometimes with multi-fidelity (or even with single fidelity), I have variance of an order of magnitude of millions and I am wondering if that makes a lot of sense to have such high variance. \r\n\r\n4. I also saw that in the notebook with multi-fidelity and bayesian optimization you added a noise of 0.1 to avoid overfitting. However, in the notebook with only the multi-fidelity, this noise is fixed to 0. So, how can you a priori know if some noise is needed ? By the way, correct me if I am wrong, but GPy automatically add a noise variance of 1e-8 (the jitter) to avoid ill-conditonned matrix, right ?\r\n\r\n5. Finally, do you think that working with the multi-fidelity, the observations should be normalized with a mean 0 and standard deviation of 1 for each fidelity or should they be kept in their original forms ?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nAnthony Larroque  ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/435/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
