Based on recent conversations I propose this approach:\r\n\r\n* On OuterLoop level we should be dealing in ModelUpdater, CandPointCalc and so on.\r\n* On concrete method level we should be dealing in problem specific terms: acquisition, update step size, etc.\r\n* If concrete method does not suit user needs, it should be clear how to create own implementation of the OuterLoop. In fact, users should be encouraged to do that.\r\n\r\nThere are few places in the code base where we currently don't follow this approach, and if everyone agrees with this proposal, we should identify and fix those places.
