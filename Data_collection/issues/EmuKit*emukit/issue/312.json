However in emukit.core.loop.user_function.py, the extra outputs have to be np.ndarrays of at least 2d and so the dictionary of extra_outputs that is returned is of the form {'key0': array([2.1]), 'key1': array([2.]), 'key2': array([1.])}. \r\n\r\nBy using this dictionary as context, when multiple context values are present, the expend_vector method in core.optimization.context_manager.py fails with a broadcast error because the context_values is no longer 1d. \r\n\r\nThis is not really an issue, as we can simply process the extra_outputs after getting them from the user_function_result to make them simple values instead of arrays. But I wanted to ask if the requirements for extra_outputs to be 2d numpy arrays is due to some functionality I am missing?\r\nI was expecting the extra_outputs to be directly compatible with context_manager when used as context? \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your answer,\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/312/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
