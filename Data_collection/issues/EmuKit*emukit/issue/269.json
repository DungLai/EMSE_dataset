It is more about my lack of knowledge rather than a software issue, so if you would like it posted else where let me know :)\r\n\r\nI have been playing around with Bayesian Quadrature in emukit (and using GPy to build my emulator). I have two questions\r\n\r\n**(1) Extending to High Dimensions with 'ARD' kernels.**\r\n\r\nI follow your worked example for the 1D_Hennig function. This works great! For my application I have a 4 dimesnional input space, so I have build a GP model in GPy\r\n\r\n```\r\nkernel = GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=4,ARD=True)\r\nm = GPy.models.GPRegression(X,Y,kernel)\r\nm.optimize(messages=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try and do BQ I get an error\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/emukit/quadrature/kernels/quadrature_rbf.py in qKq(self)\r\n     74         erf_term = erf(diff_bounds_scaled) * diff_bounds_scaled * np.sqrt(np.pi)\r\n     75 \r\n---> 76         return np.float(prefac * (exp_term + erf_term).prod())\r\n     77 \r\n     78     # the following methods are gradients of a quadrature kernel\r\n\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is becuase I am using ARD Squared Exponential Kernel. Is there a way around this? With some digging in your code base I can't see an example or a different class to use. Or do I need to hack it, by rescaling my problem in each of the dimensions? Then retraining an isotropic kernel?\r\n\r\n**(2) BQ for more complex integral.**\r\n\r\nIn the application I am looking at I actually want to do a more complex integral so if f(x) is my integrand which is expensive to compute, I also have a functional r(x) ( in my case a multivariant Gaussian) which is fast to compute, I want to do BQ on \r\n\r\nI = \\int f(x)r(x)dx\r\n\r\nThis is the setting laid out by O'Hagan in his BQ paper. Is there an example of this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nTim Dodwell\r\nTuring & Exeter","closed_by":{"login":"mmahsereci","id":42842079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQyMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42842079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci","html_url":"https://github.com/mmahsereci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
