I tested with Branin function. I suspect it is because the Negative LCB is possible to produce negative values, while the local penalization function requires positive values from acquisition functions. (I'm surprised the code can still run though.)\r\n\r\nI wonder if some implementation of \"softplus\" as implemented in GPyOpt can solve this problem. If not, could you please provide some suggestions? Thank you. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
