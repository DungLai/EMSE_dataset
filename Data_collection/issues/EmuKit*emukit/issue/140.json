For these reasons I would like to see if we could somehow get rid of that dependency being required.\r\n\r\nWe depend on GPy and GPyOpt in following places:\r\n1. Model free designs\r\nIt is possible to even copy over relevant code pieces from GPyOpt and get rid of that dependency.\r\n2. Optimizer\r\nSame thing, we could copy, or re-impelement\r\n3. Multi-fidelity\r\nThis is harder, but we could consider multi-fidelity as an extra bit of the package. People could successfully run decision loops in Emukit without multi-fidelity feature.\r\n\r\nNote that 1 and 2 help us remove GPyOpt as a dependency at all.\r\n\r\nOpinions welcome.","closed_by":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
