Currently they are only multiplied with the density (without the square) , see [here](https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/blob/main/emukit/quadrature/acquisitions/uncertainty_sampling.py#L43). \r\n\r\nThe default should be with the square, and optionally without it, but the change might break someones code. Not sure how many people use the BQ uncertainty sampling acquisition function though. \r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n1. change the default to square, and optionally non-square (is better but might break someones code)\r\n2. leave default at non-square, and optionally square (not the common default, does not break code)\r\n\r\nI would still opt for 1.
