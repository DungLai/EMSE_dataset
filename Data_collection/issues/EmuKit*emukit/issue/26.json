If the evaluation is cost/budget sensitive e.g., in multi-fidelity/source models or models where the input location determines the evaluation cost, then we might want to check after point calculation, too. Alternatively the point calculator could be smarter and only return points which are still below budget, but that is harder to do.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
