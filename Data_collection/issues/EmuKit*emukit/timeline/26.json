One is the stoping condition itself, which is well defined, and the other one is how the decisions about the next points to collect are affected by that. \r\n\r\nIf we think about a simple case of making non-myopic decisions just using the remaining evaluation budget (no cost) what we need to do is to pass the state of the loop into the acquisition and handle the logic of the decision inside. \r\n\r\nThe case of having costs is harder because the stopping condition needs to know if given the current state (knowledge about the cost) the acquisition is going make a decision that is feasible within the given budget (otherwise we'll incur into a cost violation). Following the discussion in issue #25 this could be handled in the customizable part of the `candidate_point_calculator` and include the stoping logic there.
