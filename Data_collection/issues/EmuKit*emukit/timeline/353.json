I'd be happy to make a PR with this change!\r\n\r\nI was wondering, what would be the best way to go about this on the model-wrapping API front? A model that would be compatible with this approximation should be able to predict without noise. This call could be made to the wrapper with an additional keyword arg: `emukit_model.predict(X, with_noise=False)`, but since this is not the standard API of `IModel`, what's the best way to specify that a model's predict function has this signature? I'm thinking a new interface like `IModelWithNoise` (or a similar name) would work, but I don't know if that's too small of a difference to have a separate interface class for it. It'd be great to hear your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nAs for whether to use this heuristic for dealing with noise, I was thinking of adding a flag in the `ExpectedImprovement`'s `__init__` function. If you think a separate acquisition would be a better solution, let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/789934943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BrunoKM","id":22356384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU2Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22356384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM","html_url":"https://github.com/BrunoKM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrunoKM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/789954869","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/353#issuecomment-789954869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/353","id":789954869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4OTk1NDg2OQ==","user":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-03T18:23:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T18:23:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yes, separate interface is the way to go.
