These are some answers to your questions:\r\n\r\n- I am not yet aware of anyone using the library for engineering optimization but there is no specific restriction that should stop you from doing that.\r\n- I also recommend to start with Matern52 but if you have some knowledge about the physics of your problem you should try to encode that in the covariance function. If you can elaborate a bit more on the specifics of your problem we can provide some references.\r\n- That's correct. You can spend your time doing MCMC on the hyper-parameters of your model and I recommend you to do that. The IntegratedExpectedImprovement is a new feature that should totally help you to do that.\r\n\r\nOne question: do you have access to a cheaper turbulent flow simulation. If you had you could try to do some multi-fidelity optimization.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/486995428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"javiergonzalezh","id":6853363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6853363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh","html_url":"https://github.com/javiergonzalezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2302585421,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMwMjU4NTQyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2302585421","actor":{"login":"javiergonzalezh","id":6853363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6853363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh","html_url":"https://github.com/javiergonzalezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T09:36:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2302585426,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMwMjU4NTQyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2302585426","actor":{"login":"polivucci","id":29206484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjA2NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29206484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci","html_url":"https://github.com/polivucci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T09:36:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2302585428,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMDI1ODU0Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2302585428","actor":{"login":"polivucci","id":29206484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjA2NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29206484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci","html_url":"https://github.com/polivucci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T09:36:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2302586199,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyMzAyNTg2MTk5

@javiergonzalezh ,\r\n\r\nthanks a lot for your answer.\r\n\r\nI have seen the multi-fidelity notebook and I think it is of great interest for fluid simulations as it is common practice to use a cheaper model whenever possible and then step up for the more promising cases. For my specific problem however, the cost of a simulation is not impossibly high so it makes sense to stick to the high-fidelity solver for now.\r\n\r\nAlso I know no straightforward way of guessing a dependence structure neither for the mean nor for the covariance. The only thing I know is that K is most likely anisotropic and ARD is needed.\r\nThe exact function is bounded on the domain considered, but I can't say much on its smoothness.\r\n\r\nBased on your suggestions, it seems a good start can be Matern52 (ARD) with IntegratedExpectedImprovement acquisition.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point for me is how many initial data to provide before starting to evaluate the acquisition function. I'm using the Latin Hypercube sampling and a rule of thumb I knew was 3*n_variables. Not sure however for Bayesian Optimization and with so little information about the underlying function.\r\n\r\nmany thanks for the

(a clone of `IntegratedExpectedImprovement` ) that accepts two GP models, one for the objective and one for the constraints, and returns the acquisition as defined in the paper. The acquisition is just the product of the standard EI on the target function times the probability of satisfying the constraints (for which the standard PoI can be easily adapted).\r\n\r\nHowever I am no sure of how to define a Bayesian Loop that can handle two (or more) models and handle them consistently.

Thanks for the update.\r\n\r\nThis is not something we have right out of the box at the moment, but it should be very easy to adapt Emukit for this use case.\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at our bayes opt loop [here](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/blob/master/emukit/bayesian_optimization/loops/bayesian_optimization_loop.py), it isn't super sophisiticated. Basically it just instantiates a bunch of parameters and passes them to OuterLoop. At the moment it creates one model updater, however OuterLoop can accept a list of them and handle it just fine.\r\n\r\nSo all you need to do, besides using your acquisition, which sounds like it works already, is to create two model updaters, one per model. You can copy over existing bayes opt loop, rewrite the line that creates those updates, and that should do it. As a matter of fact, [cost sensitive bayes opt loop](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/blob/master/emukit/bayesian_optimization/loops/cost_sensitive_bayesian_optimization_loop.py) which we already have, does exactly that.\r\n\r\nHope it

@apaleyes and @javiergonzalezh,\r\n\r\nI've found some time to adjust the code, I hope it makes sense.\r\nHopefully you have some remarks on better/smarter ways to implement this.\r\n\r\n1) BO loop: I used a modified version of the `CostSensitiveBayesianOptimizationLoop` which I called `ConstrainedBayesianOptimizationLoop`.\r\nThe only differences are the use of the constraint instead of the cost and the acquisition function that is different.\r\nI did not change anything in `loop_state`, I simply used the already available `cost` variable to store the constraint evaluations. Not sure how easily this can be generalised to more than one constraint (not strictly needed by me at the moment).\r\n\r\n2) Integrated Acquisition: I have used `IntegratedHyperParameterAcquisition` straight away with no change. Since by default it runs MCMC using the evaluator of a single-model acquisition, `IntegratedHyperParameterAcquisition` had to be applied individually to the objective and the constraint evauators  (obj and constr being independent).\r\nIn summary, I defined `ConstrainedExpectedImprovement` such that:\r\n```\r\nacquisition_objective = IntegratedHyperParameterAcquisition(model_obj,ExpectedImprovement)\r\nacquisition_constraint = IntegratedHyperParameterAcquisition(model_constr,ProbabilityOfFeasibility)\r\nacquisition = ConstrainedExpectedImprovement(acquisition_objective,acquisition_constraint)\r\n```\r\nwhere inside `ConstrainedExpectedImprovement` I defined:\r\n```\r\ndef evaluate(self, x: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\r\n   return acquisition_objective.evaluate(x) * acquisition_constraint.evaluate(x)\r\n```\r\nand likewise w/ gradients.\r\n`ConstrainedBayesianOptimizationLoop` takes in `acquisition` together with the two models.\r\n \r\nI have run some Branin-Hoo tests and it seems to work as expected.\r\nNot yet tested for batch_size>1.\r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\nPO","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/497959250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"polivucci","id":29206484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjA2NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29206484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci","html_url":"https://github.com/polivucci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polivucci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2382789127,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4Mjc4OTEyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2382789127","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T16:37:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2382789128,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODI3ODkxMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2382789128","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T16:37:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2382789129,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4Mjc4OTEyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2382789129","actor":{"login":"javiergonzalezh","id":6853363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6853363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh","html_url":"https://github.com/javiergonzalezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T16:37:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2382789130,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODI3ODkxMzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2382789130","actor":{"login":"javiergon

makes a lot of sense to me. \r\n\r\nSomething you can do to simplify your code is to define your acquisition as the product of EI and the constraint. If you do ```acquisition = acquisition_objective * acquisition_constraint``` everything should work as we have an internal algebra for acquisition objects. This way you don't have to hard code  the ```ConstrainedExpectedImprovement``` and you don't have to worry about the gradients of the new acquisition that you are building.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a
