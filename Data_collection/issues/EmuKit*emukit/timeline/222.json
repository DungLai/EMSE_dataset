Can you provide some details about what you are trying to do? Having an specific example will help us to identify better what is missing.\r\n\r\nAlso, have you try to start with a wrapper for GPflow like the [one we have for GPy](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/blob/master/emukit/model_wrappers/gpy_model_wrappers.py)? This will give you direct access to all the stuff already implemented.
