When you are creating the model, it's just plain GPRegression from GPy, with all default parameters. This includes default prior values for lengthscale, variance and noise, all set to 1 in GPy by default I believe. Usually this isn't a problem, but in your case this is completely out of scale of actual inputs and outputs. When I am playing with different combinations of prior values for these, the result is very different fits.\r\n\r\nThe simplest thing to try would be to normalize your data to [0,1]. Setting priors might also be worth it, but it's much harder to pick good ones, and probably won't be necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/1054888885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/1055114722","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/403#issuecomment-1055114722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/403","id":1055114722,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMd5484-48Xi","user":{"login":"iRove108","id":12959037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108","html_url":"https://github.com/iRove108","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRove108/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-01T07:37:28Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T07:55:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, thank you so much for that—I really appreciate the help!
