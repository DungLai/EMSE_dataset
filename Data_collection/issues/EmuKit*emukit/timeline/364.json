When I set this to False, tests pass.\r\n\r\nThe problem though is that 1.9.9 and lower wouldn't recognize this parameter at all, so we cannot just make a change in Emukit saying `include_likelihood=False` each time we call the function. The options I see now:\r\n 1. Require GPy>=1.10.0 \r\n 2. Require GPy<=1.9.9 (poor I think)\r\n 3. Dynamically figure out if we can pass the parameter (very poor)\r\n 4. call `_raw_posterior_covariance_between_points`. This would be ugly as the method is marked as private, but really it was public before, so this can be debated.\r\n\r\nI guess I am leaning towards option 1. @ekalosak
