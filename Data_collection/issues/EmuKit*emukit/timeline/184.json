So when users come to Emukit, it is expected that they have already done necessary preparations in order to be able to create a model. For one, it is assumed that they have already dealt with encoding their categorical features. Emukit needs to know what encoding is used by the model, hence the Encoding class, and a few most common implementations.\r\n\r\nEmukit essentially takes both objective and model as library inputs. But it is reasonable to expect that these two don't take input in the same form, especially when there are categoricals in there. Emukit tries to be as non-opinionated as possible about how people tackled that bit while building a model.\r\n\r\nIt is briefly touched upon in [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amzn/emukit/blob/master/notebooks/Emukit-Categorical-with-Tensorflow.ipynb), but we could have probably done a better job explaining this. Is there anything that you, as a user, would find most helpful?\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that there is a way for the library to cover this question better, but at the moment I don't see one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/482062493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/482492114","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/184#issuecomment-482492114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/184","id":482492114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjQ5MjExNA==","user":{"login":"dekuenstle","id":734721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/734721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle","html_url":"https://github.com/dekuenstle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-12T08:45:19Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T08:45:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your detailed answer. \r\nThe `emukit_friendly_objective_function` in the linked notebook is a good example.  \r\nSo basically emukit expects both the model and the objective to use the same encoding, all transformations are up to the user. I think the explainations in the library are fine for this, I just confused myself by the terms used in GPyOpt (objective/model encoding and objective function). \r\nThe user has to define it's config space in emukit anyway. I think it would therefore help for a end-to-end experience (bring objective and model, define the space and loop, emukit deals with the rest), if emukit would provide more utility to encode/decode the data. E.g. as user_function-wrappers and/or methods of the space and parameters.
