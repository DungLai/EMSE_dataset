This is leftover from GPyOpt where things like local penalization were implemented in a such a way that you were no longer optimizing an acquisition object but just an arbitrary python function. I'm not sure if we will need to do that in emukit.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of passing in either `f` or `f_df` but we will still have to do some magic in the optimizers as the interface to scipy optimizers are inconsistent - the current lbfgs optimizer wants `f_df` whereas the trust region optimizer wants `f` and `df` separately.
