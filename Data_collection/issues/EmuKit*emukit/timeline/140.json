I don't really know, but the code in the docs should at least run without GPy if we remove it as a dependency. The \"intro\" notebooks should also run. \r\n\r\nI'd consider the intro notebooks to be:\r\n- Emukit-tutorial-basic-use-of-the-library\r\n- Emukit-tutorial-intro\r\n\r\nand maybe the BayesOpt intro. I think it is fine in general for notebooks to have other dependencies (we have one that depends on tensorflow for instance).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/497775376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marpulli","id":33632490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjMyNDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33632490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli","html_url":"https://github.com/marpulli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/497790051","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/140#issuecomment-497790051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/140","id":497790051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Nzc5MDA1MQ==","user":{"login":"mmahsereci","id":42842079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQyMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42842079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci","html_url":"https://github.com/mmahsereci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-31T17:15:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T17:15:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I guess for notebooks it makes sense how you say.
