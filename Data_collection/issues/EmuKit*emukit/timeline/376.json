Have a look at the multi-fidelity deep GP example implemented in Emukit: https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/tree/main/emukit/examples/multi_fidelity_dgp\r\n\r\nIt is built with GPFlow 1.x and provides an Emukit-compatible model. I don't now how much data it is able to process though, but worth a try. The Cutajar et al. paper that this implementation was created for reportedly run experiments on  800 000 low fidelity points.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/860084588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5159121715,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTE1OTEyMTcxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/5159121715","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-14T21:46:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
