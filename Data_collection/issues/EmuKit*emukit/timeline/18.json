We would like to have as few cost specific parts as possible. Here are some ideas:\r\n- We would pass in a list of `ModelUpdater`s to the `OuterLoop`. For the cost model case it would call `update()` on both model updaters. It should be able to deal with either one or a list of them. We would need to be able to tell a `ModelUpdater` whether it should use `Y` or `cost` as the training targets.\r\n- The `UserFunctionWithCost` would change depending on what exactly the cost is, so we might want to leave this to the user for now, but if there are common cases (such as timing the function evaluation), we could provide this functionality.\r\n- We can probably just add a `cost` field to the `UserFunctionResult` with a default value of `None`.\r\n- We need to add `cost` as a property of `LoopState`.\r\n\r\nI agree about not needing any new interface for the acquisitions. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/427436637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marpulli","id":33632490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjMyNDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33632490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli","html_url":"https://github.com/marpulli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/427549349","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/18#issuecomment-427549349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/18","id":427549349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzU0OTM0OQ==","user":{"login":"aaronkl","id":5735696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU2OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5735696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-06T06:04:44Z","updated_at":"2018-10-06T06:04:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds good to me.
