Here are my two cents on the issue:\r\n\r\n1. I think you're right that `GPBayesianOptimization` essentially ignores `normalize_Y` and uses the default value set in GPy.  I believe that `GPBayesianOptimization` was intended as a high-level wrapper that requires minimal inputs from the user.  I agree that `normalize_Y` should be included in `_model_choser(self)`.  (Or it should be removed from the kwargs in `GPBayesianOptimization`.)  \r\n\r\n2. I tend to prefer `BayesianOptimization` because it offers more flexibility in terms of model definition.  `BayesianOptimization` uses whatever model is passed to it, and does not override the value of `normalize_Y` (I think). \r\n\r\n3. The normalization problem also appears in `ExperimentalDesignLoop`, which also requires the user to provide their own `model`.  I believe that the Quadrature loops operate the same way.  I haven't checked the Multi-fidelity or Sensitivity analysis models.  \r\n\r\n4.  Many of the examples in the Tutorials use a step-by-step approach to show the basic concept of each method.  This includes custom (\"upstream\") model definition and acquisition plots.  I suspect that anybody who wants to do a bit of experimentation will stumble on the gradient issue.\r\n\r\n5.  I mentioned in an earlier post that GPyOpt suffers from the same problem.  After some more digging, it appears that that is not the case.  From what I can tell, the models in GPyOpt only \"see\" normalized data (for instance, see ``_update_model``), so that the snippet in the Original Post won't raise any error, regardless of the value of `normalizer`.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to correct if I missed anything.  Thanks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/575137398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ablancha","id":16860305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODYwMzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16860305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha","html_url":"https://github.com/ablancha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/575583148","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/279#issuecomment-575583148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/279","id":575583148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTU4MzE0OA==","user":{"login":"AnthonyLarroque","id":44471624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDcxNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44471624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque","html_url":"https://github.com/AnthonyLarroque","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-17T11:09:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T11:09:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Antoine,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your answers !\r\n\r\nTo answer some of your comments:\r\n\r\n2. Thank for the advice, you are right. I am currently working with GP so I was using GPBayesianOptimization and modified this class a little bit to include more features about the GaussianProcess or the acquisition functions. But if I am planning to use more complex models, I will probably use BayesianOptimization. I also might do a pull request if the emukit developers are interested for the GPBayesianOptimization ? These new features include the possibility to change the jitter, beta, batch_size, or the kernel of the GP for examples.\r\n\r\n3. For the sensitivity and multi-fidelity, I am not sure. The user is also required to provide the model but I do not know how the predictive_gradients are really used in that cases. \r\n\r\n4.  I did not see the option normalizer=True set in any tutorials so as long as people are following the tutorials and do not touch the normalizer, I think they should be fine if the normalizer is set by default to None in their GPy versions. But yes, that may be a problem if they change it.\r\n\r\n5. I agree with you. The models in GPyOpt seem to normalize directly the Y if the normalize_Y is set to True without setting the normalizer for the GPy model.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAnthony Larroque \r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/575583148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AnthonyLarroque","id":44471624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDcxNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44471624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque","html_url":"https://github.com/AnthonyLarroque","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyLarroque/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/575654749","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/279#issuecomment-575654749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/279","id":575654749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTY1NDc0OQ==","user":{"login":"ablancha","id":16860305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODYwMzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16860305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha","html_url":"https://github.com/ablancha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ablancha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-17T14:46:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T14:46:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, Anthony.
