I think we could fairly easily implement such as local search method as following:\r\n\r\n1. get a starting configuration and the maximum number of steps as input\r\n2. compute the neighborhood of the starting configuration by flipping each element while keeping all other elements of the configuration fix\r\n3. for each neighbor compute the acquisition value\r\n4. if we reached the maximum number of steps or we haven't improved upon our starting point return the starting point  otherwise replace the starting point with the best neighbor and repeat with step 2.\r\n\r\nThe only somewhat challenging part here is to compute the neighbors. For categorical parameters we could simply encode them first as a one-hot-encoding vector and randomly replace one 0 by 1. For ordinal or integer parameters we would need to change it to the next higher / lower value.\r\nSo I guess we could use `emukit.core.encoding` for that, we would just need another function that transforms them back into a Parameter object.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/466083549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aaronkl","id":5735696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU2OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5735696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2262192736,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI2MjE5MjczNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2262192736","actor":{"login":"dekuenstle","id":734721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/734721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle","html_url":"https://github.com/dekuenstle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-09T09:20:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
