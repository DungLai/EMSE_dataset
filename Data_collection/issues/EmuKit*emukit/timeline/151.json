David,\r\n\r\nThanks for opening this issue! \r\n\r\nI think the confusion comes from the fact that we minimize the negative of the acquisition function and the optimum value returned by `self.acquisition_optimizer.optimize(acquisition, context)` [here](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/blob/7e9d3ca212e9149a399911c482adf15514168872/emukit/core/optimization/multi_source_acquisition_optimizer.py#L64) is actually the negative of the acquisition value at the optimum.\r\n\r\nWe then take the minimum of the negative acquisition values in order to find the maximum of the non-negative acquisition values. \r\n\r\nI agree that this is confusing and we should change `self.acquisition_optimizer.optimize(acquisition, context)` to return the acquisition value at the optimum rather than the negative acquisition value at the optimum.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMark","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/452649189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marpulli","id":33632490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjMyNDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33632490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli","html_url":"https://github.com/marpulli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marpulli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/452680476","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/151#issuecomment-452680476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/151","id":452680476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjY4MDQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"dekuenstle","id":734721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/734721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle","html_url":"https://github.com/dekuenstle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekuenstle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-09T12:31:13Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T12:31:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Mark,\r\nthanks for the explanation.\r\nAs a quickfix, the docstrings of the return value could also be changed to `:return: ... *negative* acquisition value at optimum)` as an alternative to changing
