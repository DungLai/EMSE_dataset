solution @apaleyes posted is maybe not the most optimal one due to it being rather slow. The solution is based on sequential sampling from the posterior and conditioning the future samples on the already drawn ones. The solution is very general and would suit for all GP models (not only the ones with Gaussian observation model). There are faster approximate strategies for Thompson sampling if the observation model is Gaussian. \r\n\r\nMy implementation doesn't fully follow the existing API. The main reason for this is the need to \"reset\" the Thompson sampling algorithm between iterations so it needs a separate reset-functionality. I don't know if it would be possible to solve this issue following the current API? However, all Thompson sampling algorithms would need this kind of functionality as they are essentially based on randomness. I think that all acquisition strategies that currently exist in emukit are deterministic, so this hasn't been thought when implementing the API.
