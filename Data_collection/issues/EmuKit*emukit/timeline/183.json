Absolutely, it would be great having these points implemented in Emukit. This is a possible way to do it  but I am sure that @mmahsereci and @apaleyes have some interesting ideas too.\r\n\r\n1 and 2 are quite generic so they can go into the main library. 1 seems easy and can be implemented as an acquisition. 2 would be, indeed, very nice to have, as this would allow to compare Monte Carlo methods with Bayesian quadrature (BQ). This [CR](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/pull/176) from @mmahsereci  already creates the abstraction for BQ although only the uniform measure is implemented so far. Using a similar abstraction for Monte Carlo would be nice. Using numpy distributions should fine, I think.\r\n\r\nFor 3, I recommend to use the [examples](https://github.com/amzn/emukit/tree/master/emukit/examples) folder at it is a bit more specific and we don't know yet how it fits with the rest of the library. We can always integrate it later.\r\n\r\n@mmahsereci @apaleyes do you think that this make sense?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/480607849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"javiergonzalezh","id":6853363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6853363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh","html_url":"https://github.com/javiergonzalezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2258039621,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI1ODAzOTYyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2258039621","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-07T16:35:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2258039622,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNTgwMzk2MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2258039622","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-07T16:35:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2258039623,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI1ODAzOTYyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2258039623","actor":{"login":"mmahsereci","id":42842079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQyMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42842079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci","html_url":"https://github.com/mmahsereci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-07T16:35:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2258039624,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNTgwMzk2MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/2258039624","actor":{"log

Yes, that is correct - the GP mean represents the so-called performance function (g(x)) of the system. We integrate the indicator function (g(x)<0) with Monte Carlo simulation. There is a big community who wish to solve problems of this form, but currently most available methods are only implemented in MATLAB/legacy code/closed source (see proceedings of ICOSSAR, ICVRAM, ESREL conferences, for nice applications).\r\n\r\n2. The probability of misclassification acquisition function is used because it has been shown to be a good way to accurately learn the indicator function. It is generally accepted in the community that if the indicator function is known and can be evaluated cheaply, via a surrogate, then in most cases a brute force monte carlo simulation will yield a satisfactory solution (see e.g. first order reliability method or importance sampling for intuition). Other researchers have defined more \"well motivated\" acquisition functions which behave in a similar way.\r\n\r\nFor context, g(x) is usually expensive to evaluate - in many cases it can take days for each evaluation. Also for most systems in practice, the failure rate is usually very small so a huge number of samples are required for standard MC simulation without a GP emulator. \r\n\r\nAnother advantage of using a GP emulator is that one can then solve the [\"Reliability Based Design Optimisation\" problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3667.pdf).\r\n\r\nI hope this explains why I am interested in an implementation!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/481653127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JCSadeghi","id":23333857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzMzODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23333857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi","html_url":"https://github.com/JCSadeghi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCSadeghi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/481731099","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/183#issuecomment-481731099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/183","id":481731099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTczMTA5OQ==","user":{"login":"mmahsereci","id":42842079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQyMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42842079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci","html_url":"https://github.com/mmahsereci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T15:08:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T15:08:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, that explains.
