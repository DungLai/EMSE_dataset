At first my thought was that we want very few, to show others \"how it's done\" while keeping the library clean and compact. From that perspective GPyWrapper should suffice, and if we want to benchmark against other libs, we can create wrappers for whatever we want without worrying about them going into core library.\r\n\r\nBut other point here would be that the more wrappers we have, the more people coming from various backgrounds can use emukit smoothly.

I'll elaborate a bit more on why I opened the issue. \r\n\r\nI want to have wrappers for GPflow and and GPyTorch is because I would like to write a notebook to explicitly show how you can change the modeling back-end and reuse other parts of the library, in BO for instance. This is one of the core features that the library promises but we don't have an explicit example at the moment.\r\n\r\nI guess that very specific wrappers should't go into the main library and can stay in the examples folder, but I don't see a big issue with having other generic wrappers as the one we have for GPy as soon as the interfaces are respected.
