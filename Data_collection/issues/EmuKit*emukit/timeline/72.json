Before starting moving things around let me know if you agree with this:\r\n\r\n**Notebooks folder:**\r\nWe can rename it as tutorials (which is more informative) and it should contain notebooks that illustrate different features of the library. These may be long tutorials or a short illustration of a new feature. These are stand alone notebooks that don't require any extra file and fully sit on Emukit components (apart from the creation of the model). The goal of the tutorials is *to learn how to use Emukit.*\r\n\r\n**Examples folder:**\r\nEach example lives in a separated folder and may call some extra files. I see examples of two types:\r\n\r\n- Elaborated notebooks (what we call tasks) that tell a narrative about a *problem/question* studied with the elements of Emukit. An example of this is the analysis of the properties of a simulator using emukit components.\r\n\r\n- The implementation of new *methods*, that use emukit components. These can live in a .py file, should have tests and ideally should be delivered together with a small illustrative notebook. These can be, for instance, the implementation of a method of a research paper. In some cases, we may consider incorporated these to the core of the library if they can be reused.\r\n \r\nDoes it make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/437180906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"javiergonzalezh","id":6853363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6853363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh","html_url":"https://github.com/javiergonzalezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javiergonzalezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/437364146","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/72#issuecomment-437364146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/72","id":437364146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzM2NDE0Ng==","user":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T13:47:24Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T13:47:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"That sounds like an excellent plan, thanks Javier. The only technical difficulty here would be testing examples. Right now we put all those tests in integration tests folder, and that is probably fine. But we could also consider keeping tests of a specific example next to the example itself.
