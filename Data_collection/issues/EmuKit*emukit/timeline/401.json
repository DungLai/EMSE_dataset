We support those, here is the [doc link](https://emukit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/emukit.core.html#emukit.core.constraints.LinearInequalityConstraint). Note that when your lower and upper bounds are the same, this turns into equality constraint, which is what you are after.\r\n\r\nAlso, here is an example of how to do constraints in Emukit. It talks about non-linear ones, but the idea is the same, you just use a different, simpler, class.\r\nhttps://nbviewer.org/github/emukit/emukit/blob/main/notebooks/Emukit-tutorial-constrained-optimization.ipynb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/1039084507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/1039402322","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/401#issuecomment-1039402322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/401","id":1039402322,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMd548499AVS","user":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-14T18:16:04Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T18:16:04Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Oh, by the way, while using constraints please be aware of an annoying bug #291 which might impact your code","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/1039402322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
