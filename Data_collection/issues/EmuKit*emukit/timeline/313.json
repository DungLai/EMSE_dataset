Hence your workaround works in that case. For another (custom) model updater that does not use the loop state object it may not work.\r\n\r\nI am curious, where do you need that functionality? I.e., that you replace the data of the model. I am asking because the active learning loop is usually used precisely to collect the data. if you replace it in the middle, you could have just started with that other data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/663005257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmahsereci","id":42842079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQyMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42842079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci","html_url":"https://github.com/mmahsereci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmahsereci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3579954338,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU3OTk1NDMzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/3579954338","actor":{"login":"ekalosak","id":6068321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjgzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6068321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalosak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-23T13:25:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3579954342,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1Nzk5NTQzNDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/events/3579954342","actor":{"login":"ekalosak","id":6068321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjgzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6068321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalosak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-23T13:25:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/663189061","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/313#issuecomment-663189061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/313","id":663189061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzE4OTA2MQ==","user":{"login":"ekalosak","id":6068321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjgzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6068321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalosak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-23T19:24:39Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T20:24:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To address your curiosity: consider an experiment in which we have imprecise knowledge about the allowable discrete elements of the objective function's domain. What's more, we don't get the precise point in the domain associated with a particular experiment until some time after the primary experiment is performed.\r\n\r\nAn example might be a combinatorial material science application where certain a priori unknown configurations of material properties are impossible to fabricate, some desired properties are only possible approximately, etc. Our goal is to improve conductive properties, e.g., and the conductivity is easy to test so we get our measurements post-fabrication quickly. However, measuring the actual fabricated properties is difficult, takes time, and comes in batches because we sent samples in batches to an external lab. Note that these material properties are part of the design space, not the objective functions's co-domain.\r\n\r\nIt might be attractive to suggest multi-fidelity optimization, but doubling the number of free parameters seems problematic when we're shooting for sample-efficiency.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr** the X data are generated with incomplete information about the allowable domain, so it's useful to be able to adjust the model data as we go when more precise information about the actually implemented X data becomes available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/663189061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ekalosak","id":6068321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjgzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6068321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalosak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/663203370","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/313#issuecomment-663203370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/313","id":663203370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzIwMzM3MA==","user":{"login":"ekalosak","id":6068321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjgzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6068321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalosak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-23T19:59:04Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T20:18:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To not get too off-track: does it make sense to have the `model.set_data()` be the definitive source of data?
