am also struggling on the implementation of the acquisition function. Following the work of Hernandez2014, the Gaussian process prior for f can be approximated by the inner product of a vector of random features and `\\theta`, where the prior of `\\theta` is a standard multivariate normal distribution. In the experiments of PBO, the length of the vector seems to be unknown. More importantly, `\\theta` is randomly drawn in a posterior, where based on my derivations, `P(\\theta| Dt)` is proportional to `P(\\theta)*P(Dt|\\theta)`, which is also proportional to `P(\\theta)P(y|X,\\theta)`. The final form of the posterior is `C*P(\\theta)*sigmoid(y1*\\phi(x1)^T*\\theta)*...*sigmoid(yn*\\phi(xn)^T*\\theta)`, where `C` is a normalization factor. Sampling from such a posterior of \\theta seems to be computationally hard especially when` \\theta` is high-dimensional (e.g. 1000 in Hernandez2014). I am not sure where my thoughts went wrong. I would really appreciate if there is any help.\r\n\r\nSorry for the bad editing. I really hope Github could add the feature of editing mathematical formulas for efficient discussions. :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJinnian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/656224968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DominickZhang","id":16048179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDQ4MTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16048179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang","html_url":"https://github.com/DominickZhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominickZhang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
