This particular loop is built with Probability Of Feasibility acquisition, which assumes `c(x) <= 0`, see here: https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/blob/main/emukit/bayesian_optimization/acquisitions/probability_of_feasibility.py#L18\r\n\r\nI do agree though the documentation shall be much clearer, we'll look into improving the docs of UnknownConstraintBO classes.
