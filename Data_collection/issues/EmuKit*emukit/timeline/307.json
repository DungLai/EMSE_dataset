issue is with there not being a pre-built wheel for scipy v1.1.0. Or pip not picking it. \r\n\r\nThis fails:\r\n`pip install numpy scipy==1.1.0`\r\n\r\nThis succeeds:\r\n\r\n`pip install numpy scipy==1.4.0`\r\n\r\nIf we insist on installing the earlier version, we need to have C libraries needed to build the wheel installed - this worked for my env:\r\n`yum install lapack-devel.x86_64 blas-devel.x86_64`\r\n`pip install numpy scipy==1.1.0`\r\n\r\nOr, potentially, one one of the .whl [here](https://pypi.org/simple/scipy/) might be suitable - and pip is wrong for deciding it isn't - in which case one can download it manually. I didn't try that because it wouldn't be a reasonable fix to suggest.\r\n\r\nWe can look into this further; changing `scipy==1.1.0` to `scipy>=1.1.0` in the meantime seems reasonable as it would solve the issue for many.\r\n\r\nAs to install order: here's my educated guess at what's happening. Pip tries to follow the following:\r\n\r\n1. Build all wheels (numpy -> scipy -> ....)\r\n    For numpy, no build is needed - a pre-built wheel is available (and was downloaded before, see line \"Using cached numpy-1.18.5-cp38-cp38-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\"). For scipy, for some reason, none of the[ pre-built wheels](https://pypi.org/simple/scipy/) for v1.1.0 will do, so pip downloads the tarball and attempts to build it.\r\n\r\n2. Install all wheels (numpy -> scipy -> ....) OR run setup.py install if a wheel build failed\r\n\r\nWe see two errors in the logs:\r\n\r\n1. Scipy wheel can't be built without numpy - and numpy hasn't been installed yet, because we're still at step 1! If numpy is installed (I checked this), we fail to build the wheel still because of missing C libraries, in my case, lapack-devel.x86_64 blas-devel.x86_64 . \r\n\r\nBut that's okay because there's still the option of setup.py install . So the installation proceeds to step 2, installs numpy (this is what the somewhat ambiguous \"Installing collected packages: numpy [...]\" line says), attempts setup.py install of scipy because no wheel was built, and..\r\n\r\n2. Fails because of missing C libraries.\r\n\r\nThe only difference for 1.4.0 is that there is a pre-built wheel available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/657588830/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MashaNaslidnyk","id":25847874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODQ3ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25847874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk","html_url":"https://github.com/MashaNaslidnyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MashaNaslidnyk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/657795799","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/307#issuecomment-657795799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/307","id":657795799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Nzc5NTc5OQ==","user":{"login":"apaleyes","id":2852301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes","html_url":"https://github.com/apaleyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apaleyes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T21:11:14Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T21:11:14Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Amazing deep dive, thanks a ton @MashaNaslidnyk !

sure there's a better way to put that, sorry. Let me try to explain - hopefully the sources are more well written and illustrative if I fall short. \r\n\r\nWe currently rely on version numbers maintained by humans to indicate which source code & pre-built wheels to install. This is dangerous for a number of reasons[1] - most relevantly because builds become nondeterministic. One specific example of the issue of nondeterministic builds is that supporting pre-built wheels can be introduced or removed without changing the semantic version tag.\r\n\r\nHaving, hopefully, motivated the need for a better solution - one such solution is to add the SHA265 checksum (what I referred to as \"hash\") of the source code to the requirements.txt. This is a popular solution for deterministic builds in the Haskell, Debian, and production R communities - it's gaining steam in the Python community[2,3] as one of the patches in the patchwork-quilt solution to Dependency Hell in the Python ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIt might be overkill here, but I bring it up to point out the risk of being free with dependency tagging - it might make issues like the present one _worse_ rather than better going forward.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n1. https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2019/05/20/improving-pip-compile-generate-hashes/\r\n2. https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4732\r\n3. https://discuss.python.org/t/draft-pep-recording-the-source-hash-of-installed-distribution/4660\r\n\r\n**tl;dr see the following excerpt lifted from [1]**\r\n<img width=\"562\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-14 at 11 15 12 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6068321/87462336-a1fa0380-c5c4-11ea-9201-189e542e380a.png\">","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/658339405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ekalosak","id":6068321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjgzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6068321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalosak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalosak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/comments/666379986","html_url":"https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/issues/307#issuecomment-666379986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EmuKit/emukit/issues/307","id":666379986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NjM3OTk4Ng==","user":{"login":"ZackArnold","id":22964949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTY0OTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22964949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold","html_url":"https://github.com/ZackArnold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZackArnold/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-30T13:55:49Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T15:16:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is there any plan for the next release that will include a solution to this scipy dependency issue?
