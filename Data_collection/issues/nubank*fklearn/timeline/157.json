The only caveat from my experience is that it takes more time to generate the lock file and you will need to generate the equivalent requirements file if you do not want to install poetry in your docker images or servers. If you do want to use poetry with docker (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53835198/integrating-python-poetry-with-docker). \r\n\r\nPip-tools can also generate hashed dependencies, but I believe they chose not to use it. Poetry looks promising and would definitely replace some scripts of this project, but if maintainers are happy the way it is, I don't see any reason to change.
