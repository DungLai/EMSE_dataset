I think you could slice the columns relevant for the encoding and do sth like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n@curry\r\ndef add_encoding(df, encoding_fn, relevant_cols):\r\n    slice = df[relevant_cols]\r\n    to_concat = [df, encoding_fn(slice)]\r\n    return pd.concat(to_concat, axis=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nso if you want do to several encodings as a pipeline:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nstandard_encoding_fns = [sth sthelse]\r\nconcat_encoding_fns = [add_encoding(encoding_fn=f, relevant_cols=relevant_cols) for f in standard_encoding_fns]\r\npipeline_fn =
