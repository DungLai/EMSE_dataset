But we can take a look of how can we make pipelines more friendly to other frameworks, and maybe even write something to take care of make this integration fklearn <> ONNX more easy(maybe another project?)\r\n\r\nBy the docs/code isn't fully clear but in our day-to-day ops, we represent models in two ways:\r\n- Saving the predict_fn that the pipelines output as a pickle(what restrict which types of models we can deploy)\r\n- Using the `_fkml_` to describe the pipe and \"translate\" it to other languages/frameworks https://github.com/nubank/fklearn/blob/master/src/fklearn/training/pipeline.py#L96\r\n\r\nBut sounds as a good opportunity to make it easier to deploy the trained models\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/comments/572645249/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"caique-lima","id":8700954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDA5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8700954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima","html_url":"https://github.com/caique-lima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2935647909,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkzNTY0NzkwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/events/2935647909","actor":{"login":"mglowacki100","id":6077538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6077538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100","html_url":"https://github.com/mglowacki100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T16:40:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2935647913,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MzU2NDc5MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/events/2935647913","actor":{"login":"mglowacki100","id":6077538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6077538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100","html_url":"https://github.com/mglowacki100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T16:40:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/comments/574358064","html_url":"https://github.com/nubank/fklearn/issues/114#issuecomment-574358064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/114","id":574358064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDM1ODA2NA==","user":{"login":"mglowacki100","id":6077538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6077538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100","html_url":"https://github.com/mglowacki100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mglowacki100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T20:27:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T20:27:4
