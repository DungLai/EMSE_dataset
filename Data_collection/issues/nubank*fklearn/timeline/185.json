Personally I'm really open to things like the ones you proposed if they still allow people to easily install the library using a `pip install fklearn` and don't require them to change a lot the dev environment.\r\n\r\n> Github actions instead of CircleCI sounds viable? or in case that doesn't make sense at all, and in that case, do you have currently a code quality workflow checking all the points, linting, formatting, code complexity, docstrings, and typing? Are you open to considering options to avoid using custom shell scripts?\r\n\r\nAbout this last one I would say that it is worth the investment only if Github actions brings something that CircleCI doesn't support as of today. Talking about what we provide, we do have codecoverage, lint, formatting and typing (most of them defined [here](https://github.com/nubank/fklearn/tree/master/scripts)). And the same thing I said about the Github actions can be applied here, I wouldn't invest time to have exactly the same experience using other tools, but if it is something that can improve the experience we can plan to migrate some stuff.\r\n\r\nFeel free to propose something related to `pyproject.toml` and/or `Poetry` and we can keep discussing. I would be happy to review the PRs and guide you on how we think about the project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/comments/1018894182/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"caique-lima","id":8700954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDA5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8700954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima","html_url":"https://github.com/caique-lima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/comments/1018894793","html_url":"https://github.com/nubank/fklearn/issues/185#issuecomment-1018894793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/185","id":1018894793,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCk64ls48uxnJ","user":{"login":"caique-lima","id":8700954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDA5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8700954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima","html_url":"https://github.com/caique-lima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T21:59:21Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T21:59:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I forgot to talk about different Python versions, I would be also really happy to improve the release/test flow for different versions.
