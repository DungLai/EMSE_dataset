We're always trying to improve the package usability!\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something, but to me this seems to be really similar to just implement a new learner from scratch, the only advantage is that with the proposed `custom_data_transformer` we guarantee the returns(`p`, `p(df)` and `log`), don't need to add the `@curry` decorator.\r\n\r\nPlus in this example I don't see why we need `sum_two_features_update_features`, because we already know which column will appear in the output so we just need to add it to the features list. I think this case is a little different from the one hot encoding, because we already know which columns will be outputted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/comments/498775189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"caique-lima","id":8700954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDA5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8700954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima","html_url":"https://github.com/caique-lima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2388966937,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4ODk2NjkzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/events/2388966937","actor":{"login":"vultor33","id":16596383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk2Mzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16596383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33","html_url":"https://github.com/vultor33","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T17:50:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2388966939,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODg5NjY5Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/events/2388966939","actor":{"login":"vultor33","id":16596383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk2Mzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16596383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33","html_url":"https://github.com/vultor33","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T17:50:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/comments/499068217","html_url":"https://github.com/nubank/fklearn/issues/69#issuecomment-499068217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/69","id":499068217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTA2ODIxNw==","user":{"login":"vultor33","id":16596383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk2Mzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16596383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33","html_url":"https://github.com/vultor33","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vultor33/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T12:47:52Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T12:48:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You
