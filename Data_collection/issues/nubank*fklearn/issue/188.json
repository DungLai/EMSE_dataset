I mean, we already have flake8 to check whether the code follows some PEP8 recommendations, but I want to be sure before adding extra elements or something that could break the current approach?\r\n\r\nI know that we have [this section](https://fklearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#code-standards) and that we are following [this guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Imports_formatting#313-imports-formatting) and PEP8, so I just want to be sure that we are in the same channel.\r\n\r\nAlso if we don't want to start adding a lot of manual/custom rules, we can work directly with an unopinionated framework like [black](https://github.com/psf/black), which usually follows everything in the PEP8 (except for the double quotes).\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
