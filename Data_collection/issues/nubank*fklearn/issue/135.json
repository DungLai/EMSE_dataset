However, according to pip's _“first found wins”_ installation strategy, **_pandas 0.24.2_** (i.e., the newest version satisfying constraint **_>=0.24.1,<0.25_**) is the actually installed version.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first found package version **_pandas 0.24.2_** just satisfies the later dependency constraint （**_pandas >=0.21_**), such installed version is very close to the upper bound of the version constraint of Pandas specified by **_statsmodels 0.11.1_**. \r\n\r\nOnce **_statsmodels_** upgrades，its newest version will be installed. Therefore, it will easily cause a dependency conflict (build failure), if the upgraded **_statsmodels_** version introduces a higher version of **_Pandas_**, violating its another version constraint **_>=0.24.1,<0.25_**.\r\n\r\nAccording to the release history of **_statsmodels_**, it habitually upgrates **_Pandas_** in its recent releases. For instance, **_statsmodels v0.10.0rc1_** upgrated Pandas’s constraint from **_>=0.15 to >=0.18_**, **_statsmodels v0.10.0rc2_** upgrated Pandas’s constraint from **_>=0.18 to >=0.19_**, and **_statsmodels v0.11.0rc1_** upgrated Pandas’s constraint from **_>=0.19 to >=0.21_**. \r\n\r\nAs such, it is a warm warning of a potential dependency conflict issue for fklearn.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependency tree\r\n```\r\nfklearn  - 1.18.0\r\n| +- cloudpickle(install version:0.8.1 version range:>=0.8.0,<0.9.0)\r\n| +- joblib(install version:0.13.2 version range:>=0.13.2,<0.14.0)\r\n| +- numpy(install version:1.16.6 version range:>=1.16.4,<1.17.0)\r\n| +- pandas(install version:0.24.2 version range:>=0.24.1,<0.25)\r\n| +- scikit-learn(install version:0.21.3 version range:>=0.21.2,<0.22.0)\r\n| +- statsmodels(install version:0.11.1 version range:>=0.9.0,<1)\r\n| | +- numpy(install version:1.16.6 version range:>=1.14)\r\n| | +- pandas(install version:0.24.2 version range:>=0.21)\r\n| | +- patsy(install version:0.5.1 version range:>=0.5)\r\n| | | +- numpy(install version:1.16.6 version range:>=1.4)\r\n| | | +- six(install version:1.14.0 version range:*)\r\n| | +- scipy(install version:1.2.3 version range:>=1.0)\r\n| +- toolz(install version:0.10.0 version range:>=0.9.0,<1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\nBest,\r\nNeolith\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/135/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
