My idea is to use extra requirements, this way we can have something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install fklearn[xgboost]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we only install the common packages + xgboost, instead of install everything.\r\nWe should also include a `fklearn[all]` to install everything\r\n\r\n### Will this change a current behavior? How?\r\n\r\nYes, standalone install will not work with most models.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nThis needs to be well documented in order to avoid a bad user experience\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caique-lima","id":8700954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDA5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8700954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima","html_url":"https://github.com/caique-lima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/84/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
