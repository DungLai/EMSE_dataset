Instructions\r\n\r\nThe specified date inteval code in splitting.py could lead to errors.\r\nPath: .\\fklearn\\src\\fklearn\\preprocessing\\splitting.py\r\n\r\n### Code sample\r\n\r\nIn splitting.py we have:\r\n\r\n    train_period = dataset[\r\n        (dataset[time_column] >= train_start_date) & (dataset[time_column] < train_end_date)]\r\n    outime_inspace_hdout = dataset[\r\n        (dataset[time_column] >= train_end_date) & (dataset[time_column] < holdout_end_date)]\r\n\r\n### Problem description\r\n\r\nWe can see from source that \"holdout_end_date\" won't be included in \"outime_inspace_hdout\" dataset.\r\nThis could mislead users. \r\nFor example, in yours regression.ipynb notebook, the date \"2016-12-31\" had completely vanished when data was splitted.\r\n\r\nAlso, looking to the source, \"train_end_date\" won't be included in \"train_period\" dateset.\r\nIt is not wrong, but is not what we would expect.\r\n\r\n### Possible solutions\r\n\r\nI would suggest to redefine this limits:\r\n\r\n    train_period = dataset[\r\n        (dataset[time_column] >= train_start_date) & (dataset[time_column] <= train_end_date)]\r\n    outime_inspace_hdout = dataset[\r\n        (dataset[time_column] > train_end_date) & (dataset[time_column] <= holdout_end_date)]\r\n\r\nIn the same file (splitting.py), the function \"time_split_dataset\" have similar behaviour.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
