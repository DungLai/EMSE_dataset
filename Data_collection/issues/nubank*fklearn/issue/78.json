However, it'd be great to start adopting a coding style more in line with what other great python packages are doing. \r\n\r\nLooking at the source code for example, here you assert that the function's input args are correct\r\nhttps://github.com/nubank/fklearn/blob/f9a42d38db8d7b78371e05c49d497f3b858ffd13/src/fklearn/training/transformation.py#L834\r\n\r\nHowever a better widespread practice is to raiseErrors for these cases.  \r\nhttps://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#244-decision\r\n\r\n```\r\nMake use of built-in exception classes when it makes sense. \r\nFor example, raise a ValueError if you were passed a negative number but were expecting a positive one. \r\nDo not use assert statements for validating argument values of a public API. \r\nassert is used to ensure internal correctness, not to enforce correct usage nor to indicate that some unexpected event occurred. \r\nIf an exception is desired in the latter cases, use a raise statement.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore in general, this feature request can be extended to adopt a more widespread code-style, such as the one in the aforementioned pyguide.\r\n\r\n### Will this change a current behavior? How?\r\nSome fair amount of code would change, mostly in error/exceptions handling. \r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\ncc @darlansf1 ","closed_by":{"login":"caique-lima","id":8700954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDA5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8700954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima","html_url":"https://github.com/caique-lima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caique-lima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/78/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/78/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
