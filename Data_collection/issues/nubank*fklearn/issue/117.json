One possible solution is to add a `fit_params` into the LightGBM function in FkLearn for increased flexibility.\r\n- This improvement would have to be done for both classification and regression.\r\n\r\n### Will this change a current behavior? How?\r\nWe would be able to configure the fit function using FkLearn.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nhttps://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pythonapi/lightgbm.LGBMClassifier.html#lightgbm.LGBMClassifier.fit\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
