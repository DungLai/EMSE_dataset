It's possible to pass \"categorical_feature\" via \"extra_params\" but an error is raised because lgbm_classification_learner uses df.values (numpy array) instead of the original pandas dataframe. \r\n\r\nTo avoid this behavior, I remove the .values and it worked\r\n\r\nWhy is it using \"df.values\"? Because of the performance?\r\n\r\nIf you agree with the solution of removing \".values\" I could do a PR.","closed_by":{"login":"fabiofabris","id":5780420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODA0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5780420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris","html_url":"https://github.com/fabiofabris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiofabris/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
