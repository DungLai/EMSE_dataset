Building a parallel evaluator would improve its performance.\r\n\r\n### Will this change a current behavior? How?\r\nNo. This feature would only make it faster when running on multicore machines\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nNeeds to be careful when running it together with other parallel methods as it may create a deadlock\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
