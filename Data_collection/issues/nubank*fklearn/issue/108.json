This leads to a problem where, if I have multiple learners in my pipeline, the final `object` depends only on the order of the learners inside the pipeline, and I lose the objects of the first learners.\r\nE.g.: My pipeline is (logistic_regression, isotonic_calibration). Since the `build_pipeline` function will merge the logs of the two objects, the final `object` will have only the isotonic calibration, and I lose the logistic_regression object.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAccess all learner objects of the pipeline, not just the last one.\r\n\r\n### Possible solutions\r\nPut the learner `object` inside the dictionary of the logs:\r\n```python\r\n    log = {'logistic_classification_learner': {\r\n        'features': features,\r\n        'target': target,\r\n        'parameters': merged_params,\r\n        'prediction_column': prediction_column,\r\n        'package': \"sklearn\",\r\n        'package_version': sk_version,\r\n        'feature_importance': dict(zip(features, clf.coef_.flatten())),\r\n        'training_samples': len(df),\r\n        'object': clf}\r\n        }\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
