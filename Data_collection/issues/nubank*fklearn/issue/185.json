And which ones seems valuable for the project itself, I mean, things like the following:\r\n\r\n- pyproject.toml file for centralized configurations (this includes mypy, flake8, isort, or maybe black(?) in the same config file).\r\n- Poetry as the default deps and venvs manager(?)\r\n- Github actions instead of CircleCI sounds viable? or in case that doesn't make sense at all, and in that case, do you have currently a code quality workflow checking all the points, linting, formatting, code complexity, docstrings, and typing? Are you open to considering options to avoid using custom shell scripts?\r\n\r\nSorry if this is dumb or something, but I saw the gitter room a little inactive and I don't know if some of those points can be a real deal or if I'm saying things that other persons had proposed.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance folks ðŸ’œ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/185/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
