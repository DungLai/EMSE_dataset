Instructions\r\nThere is some missing information and duplicated lines on splitting.py documentation.\r\nPath: .\\fklearn\\src\\fklearn\\preprocessing\\splitting.py\r\n\r\n### Describe the documentation issue\r\n\r\nIt is in space_time_split_dataset function:\r\n```\r\n    Returns\r\n    ----------\r\n    train_set : pandas.DataFrame\r\n        The in ID sample and in time training set.\r\n\r\n    intime_outspace_hdout : pandas.DataFrame\r\n        The out of ID sample and in time hold out set.  #duplicated line\r\n\r\n    outime_inspace_hdout : pandas.DataFrame\r\n         The

rows with selected ID and in specified timestamps are included\r\n\r\n    outime_inspace_hdout : pandas.DataFrame\r\n        Samples with timestamp >= train_end_date and timestamp <
