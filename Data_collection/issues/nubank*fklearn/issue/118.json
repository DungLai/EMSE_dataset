One possible solution is to add a `fit_params` into the CatBoost function in FkLearn for increased flexibility.\r\n- This improvement would have to be done for both classification and regression.\r\n\r\nThis is important especially for CatBoost because the parameter that allows it to treat categorical features byitself is inside the `fit` method, and this is the main differential in this library.\r\n\r\n### Will this change a current behavior? How?\r\nWe would be able to configure the fit function using FkLearn.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nhttps://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/python-reference_catboost_fit.html\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nubank/fklearn/issues/118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
