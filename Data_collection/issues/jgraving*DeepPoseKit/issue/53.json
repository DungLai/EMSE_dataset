I simply did:\r\n\r\naugmenter = FlipAxis(generator, axis=1)\r\nflip_image, flip_keypoints = augmenter(images=image, keypoints=keypoints)\r\n\r\nI noticed that if I change the parent class of FlipAxis from iaa.Flipud to iaa.Fliplr, then I only get images flipping left-right, regardless of axis specified. I didn't investigate any further than that and I'm not really familiar with the imgaug library. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
