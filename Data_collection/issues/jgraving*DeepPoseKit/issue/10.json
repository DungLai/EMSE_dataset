I reached 40 Epochs until CoLab disconnected, and I would like to use the last best model (which was saved) to continue training. I have looked but can't find advice for how to do this, but it would be really useful, especially for those of us using CoLab rather than a machine with a GPU.\r\n\r\nIs this possible? If so, what would I need to load?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDavid","closed_by":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
