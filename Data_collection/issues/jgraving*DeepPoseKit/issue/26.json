It would be great to have optional MaxPooling2D layer(s) at the input of DPK, which would downsample the input and cause the inference to be (way) faster. The output coordinates would need to be scaled up, etc. I think many would really benefit from the increased speed. What do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRick","closed_by":{"login":"richard-warren","id":31221441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIxNDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31221441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren","html_url":"https://github.com/richard-warren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
