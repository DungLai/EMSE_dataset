In deeplabcut there are no skeletons, so maybe the user would provide the h5 deeplabcut labeled data, the frames and the csv of the skeleton. I would like to help to develop code around this but would like to hear your feedback first. I have a bunch of data that would love to try asap with deepposekit.\r\n\r\n[Pura vida,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Costa_Rica#Pura_vida)","closed_by":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
