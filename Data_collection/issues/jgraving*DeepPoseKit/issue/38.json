I am using images of the size 360x640 but when I ran the training I stumbled on the \"multiple of 2\" problem. So now I decided to resize my already annotated images and also adapt the keypoints locations using the resize ratio. I am doing something like this : \r\n\r\n```\r\nlst = list(data_generator)\r\nnew_lst = []\r\n\r\nfor e in lst:\r\n    le = list(e)\r\n    le[0] = cv2.resize(np.squeeze(le[0]), (512, 256))\r\n    le[0] = np.expand_dims(le[0], axis=0)\r\n    le[0] = np.expand_dims(le[0], axis=3)\r\n    le[1][:,0] = le[1][:,0] * 512 / 640\r\n    le[1][:,1] = le[1][:,1] * 256 / 360\r\n    \r\n    te = tuple(le)\r\n    new_lst.append(te)\r\n    \r\nnew_tuple = tuple(new_lst)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut because the data_generator object is of typle DataGenerator I can't simple put : \r\n`data_generator = new_tuple` although it looks very much like a tuple.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions on how I can rescale my images and keypoints after I already finished the annotation part?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
