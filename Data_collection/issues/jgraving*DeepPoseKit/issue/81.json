However, seems some layers aren't support by these libraries (for example, the library keras2onnx doesn't support some layers on deepPOseKIt). \r\n\r\nIs there any libraries or scripts I can use to convert the .h5 file generate by DeepPoseKit to TensorRT or ONNX? I need to run it through Nvidia's deepstream, which doesn't support .h5 model well. \r\n\r\nIf I cannot convert it to onnx or tensortRT, is that possible to convert it to other models like Caffe model so I can run it through Nvidia's deepstream?
