Unfortunately I am already working with the \"base\" class `VideoCapture` from OpenCV and cannot simply implement your `VideoReader` into my existing framework (as far as I can tell). \r\n\r\nWhile your code suggests that any model exported and loaded needs the `VideoReader` for prediction, I assume it is a function that will pass the frames directly, with the \"pure\" `predict()` function somewhere deep within. Even though `batch-size = 1` is possible to set and the `VideoReader` is only passing frames without altering them (if `gray = False`), I was not able to pass frames directly to `model.predict()`. I did not find the code for your `model.predict()` yet. When passing a single frame from `VideoCapture.read()` to `model.predict(frame)`, I get a dimension error (I can post it in more detail if you'd like) which I assume means that simply passing it a frame does not work.\r\n\r\nSo my question is: Is there a way to directly access the `model.predict` function within each loaded model and pass it a single frame.\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW I am using your (fly) data repository for testing now, thank you for providing it!","closed_by":{"login":"JensBlack","id":44863941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODYzOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44863941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack","html_url":"https://github.com/JensBlack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensBlack/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/64/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/64/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
