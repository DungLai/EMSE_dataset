I am using the example Notebook. But I am a little bit confused. \r\nThe notebook says that DeepPoseKit only supports image resolutions that can be repeatedly divided by 2. DeepPoseKit does not support my image resolution (1280*720). It suggests to crop or resize the images manuallyâ€”my question is how I can keep the coordinates of annotated labels if I crop or resize the images. \r\nThanks for the help. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gokcergun","id":7740778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7740778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun","html_url":"https://github.com/gokcergun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokcergun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
