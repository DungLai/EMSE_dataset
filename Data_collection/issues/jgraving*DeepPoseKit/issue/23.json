What is the expected behavior of DataGenerator for annotations set to NaN in the annotations h5 file? I use my own labeling GUI and set to NaN all features that are not present within a frame. However, the DataGenerator spits out very large negative numbers (-999999) rather than nan for the annotations set to nan in the annotation h5 file. Is this correct, and will the keras generator spit out all-zero target maps for these features?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRick","closed_by":{"login":"richard-warren","id":31221441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIxNDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31221441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren","html_url":"https://github.com/richard-warren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richard-warren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
