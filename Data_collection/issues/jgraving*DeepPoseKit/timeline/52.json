is just a suggestion for a possible fix for the draw_graph function. The first thing it does is restrict edge_confidence to the indices where lines != -1 (that is, it restricts edge_confidence to the output layers corresponding to non-parent keypoints). I think this should work for all graphs - but maybe I've overlooked something. It at least works for the graph I described in issue #52. The second thing it does is check to see if the keypoints don't exist, in which case a line is not drawn.

for the great package! What is the expected behavior of DataGenerator for annotations set to NaN in the annotations h5 file? I use my own labeling GUI and set to NaN all features that are not present within a frame. However, the DataGenerator spits out very large negative numbers (-999999) rather than nan for the annotations set to nan in the annotation h5 file. Is this correct, and will the keras generator spit out all-zero target maps for these features?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRick","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
