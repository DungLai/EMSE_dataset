However, I'm a bit confused by your feature request, so I'd appreciate if you could provide more details.\r\n\r\nDuring model training and when annotating images, the image data are dynamically loaded into memory as single images or in small training batches from the HDF5 file—which is stored on the disk, not in memory—so there should be no problems with the data fitting into memory. See https://github.com/jgraving/deepposekit/blob/master/deepposekit/io/DataGenerator.py#L80 for more details.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use an existing dataset, we have preliminary code for converting to the deepposekit format, but we are still working to make this easier. You can find examples here: https://github.com/jgraving/deepposekit-contrib/tree/master/notebooks\r\n\r\nThat being said, the DataGenerator class could certainly be modified to support other data formats, but it's unclear to me how useful this would be vs. converting data to the existing HDF5 format.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/518176702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/518333501","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/3#issuecomment-518333501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/3","id":518333501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODMzMzUwMQ==","user":{"login":"lambdaloop","id":460805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDgwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/460805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop","html_url":"https://github.com/lambdaloop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-05T17:51:52Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T17:51:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah I see, thank you for clarifying! \r\n\r\nYes, that makes sense. I didn't realize that it was opening the HDF5 file each time to read a couple images and not loading into memory.\r\n\r\nThat said, I still think this would be a useful feature. Many existing datasets (e.g. MPII Human Pose, COCO keypoints) consist of folders with images so it would be more convenient to generate a small HDF5 file which has annotations with paths to all the images, rather than generate a huge HDF5 file with all the image data. It also makes it easier to inspect the images.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/518333501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lambdaloop","id":460805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDgwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/460805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop","html_url":"https://github.com/lambdaloop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambdaloop/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2639933173,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2Mzk5MzMxNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/events/2639933173","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-17T13:38:52Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/536517776","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/3#issuecomment-536517776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/3","id":536517776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjUxNzc3Ng==","user":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T11:20:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T11:20:02Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"We've now added a (experimental) data generator for loading DeepLabCut data (see here for example: https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/blob/master/examples/deeplacut_data_example.ipynb).
