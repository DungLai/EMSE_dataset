There are two things you need to do. First, make sure `optimizer=True` for the `ModelCheckpoint` callback. Saving and loading the model with the optimizer intact will take longer, but you need this information to resume training. \r\nE.g.: \r\n```python\r\nmodel_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(\r\n    HOME + \"/deepposekit-data/datasets/fly/best_model_densenet.h5\",\r\n    monitor=\"val_loss\",\r\n    verbose=1,\r\n    save_best_only=True,\r\n    optimizer=True,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, when loading the model with `load_model` make sure to pass the same `datapath` and `augmenter` arguments from when you defined your `TrainingGenerator`. E.g.:\r\n```python\r\nfrom deepposekit.models import load_model\r\n\r\nmodel = load_model(\r\n    HOME + \"/deepposekit-data/datasets/fly/best_model_densenet.h5\",\r\n    datapath=annotations[0],\r\n    augmenter=augmenter\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDepending on the complexity of the model it may take awhile to load with the optimizer. You should then be able to resume training with `model.fit`, but let me know if you run into trouble.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/532702358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2658661175,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2NTg2NjExNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/events/2658661175","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-24T16:05:36Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/534628804","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/10#issuecomment-534628804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/10","id":534628804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDYyODgwNA==","user":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T16:05:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T16:05:39Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I'll close this for now.
