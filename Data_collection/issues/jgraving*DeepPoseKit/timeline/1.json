I think the easiest way to proceed on your specific issue is for me to write some generic code for how to implement a h5file from scratch using a randomly generated dataset. I'll upload this to the repo and you can use it to develop a function for converting DLC data to DPK.\r\n\r\nI also think the best way to manage contributed code for now is to create separate a contrib module similar to what TF and Keras did during early development. This allows for rapid development of new ideas that may not be fully functional without impacting the functionality of the core codebase. Then as the contributed code becomes more stable and widely used it can be moved to the core package. I'll put this together ASAP.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/498532695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/504001019","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/1#issuecomment-504001019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/1","id":504001019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDAwMTAxOQ==","user":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T12:11:11Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T12:11:11Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I've created a repo at https://github.com/jgraving/deepposekit-contrib for user contributions.
