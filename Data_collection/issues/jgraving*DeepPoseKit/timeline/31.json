see. @jgraving could you please clarify that Windows support for DeepPoseKit is not of your interest so I won't spend my time publishing fixes for that and won't spend your time reviewing them? Doing Ubuntu-only project is completely OK, you is the author anyway, but according to your top README.md there is some Windows support. The problem is that these instructions are misleading and deadly outdated, so anyone who will try to use DeepPoseKit on Windows will be quite disappointing. The examples/Jupyter notebooks are full of Linux-specific stuff. And the 5 minutes loading time is just one of the problems. \r\nIt would be better if you remove all mentions of Windows from repository and state clearly \"This is for Linux only\" if you don't have time/intent of dealing with it.\r\nP.S. you don't have control over `tf.keras.models.load_model` but you do have control over what is pushed into

not a paid software developer, and it is not my job to provide support for this or any software. Any time I spend on this project is a donation of my free time, so I don't appreciate the hostile tone of your message (whether you intended it as hostile or not). Support for Windows is limited because I don't use Windows, not because I have no interest in supporting it. There are multiple people in our group successfully using DeepPoseKit on Windows, but they have not complained of any major issues. The included notebooks are meant to be examples of how to use the code, not coverage for all use cases.\r\n\r\nThe README also says that contributions from the community are welcome, so if you have comments or suggestions for how to improve the code for Windows then please open an issue or PR to do so. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'm unsure what you would like me to do in this case. The issue you opened here seems to be out of my control, as all the code used within `deepposekit.models.load_model` is standard to TF/Keras for saving/loading Keras models and there is no reason it should take an extraordinarily long time to run. If you've found a fix for the problem then you should open a PR.

I'm sorry if my comment looks hostile for you. It is probably was my overreaction to immediate closing of this issue. To my knowledge the common practice in collaborative open source software development is to wait if anyone else has information regarding the issue (as you can see this is exactly what happened) and/or let person who opened the issue to take responsibility and close it by him/herself.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm being paid for adapting DeepPoseKit for our needs. So I offered improvements (see my PR) and ask for the help in the area I'm currently not familiar with. The disadvantage is that we need DeepPoseKit to be used on Windows. So I have to choose - try to adapt DeepPoseKit in the way compatible with both Windows and Ubuntu, or make a hard fork. I prefer the former way so I just wanted to understand which way do you prefer.\r\n\r\n> There are multiple people in our group successfully using DeepPoseKit on Windows, but they have not complained of any major issues.\r\n\r\nThat looks wonderful if all these users update their environments regularly. What I see really often in scientific programming field is \"project installed once by user A, - environment never get updated, - few month later conda/pip packages get updated at the upstream, - user B try to install the same thing, - newer packages get installed, - everything exploded due to version mismatch. In the worst case BS like Docker if used as the “solution”.\r\n\r\n> The included notebooks are meant to be examples of how to use the code, not coverage for all use cases.\r\n\r\nThe examples of how to use the code is not enough for painless multi-platform development. First thing **new** user need to do is to make sure that his/her new environment is correct and the code is producing expected output. For that - a testing suite (a set of plain Python scripts used for testing environment after upstream updates and/or making big changes in the local project code) is absolutely necessary.

week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/557544867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2823351764,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyODIzMzUxNzY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/events/2823351764","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-22T14:07:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2823353432,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4MjMzNTM0MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/events/2823353432","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-22T14:07:56Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/558447083","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/31#issuecomment-558447083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/31","id":558447083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODQ0NzA4Mw==","user":{"login":"DenisPolygalov","id":18456799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDU2Nzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18456799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov","html_url":"https://github.com/DenisPolygalov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T03:49:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T03:49:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did some search on what `compile` flag actually does, maybe it will be useful for someone. The documentation says:\r\n\r\n>  If an optimizer was found as part of the saved model, the model is already compiled. Otherwise, the model is uncompiled and a warning will be displayed. When compile is set to False, the compilation is omitted without any warning.\r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/load_model\r\n\r\nThe DeepPoseKit-Data/datasets/fly/annotation_data_release.h5 contain model that is already compiled. As far as I understand the compilation of the model actually occurs during/after the model training.\r\n\r\nIt seems like when executed on Linux - TensorFlow detects that the model to be loaded is already compiled and omit compilation automatically. On Windows however, the model will be compiled in any case. So this is not a bug of DeepPoseKit _per se,_ but rather ambiguous behavior of TensorFlow.\r\n\r\nEnforcing compile=False on Windows (as in my PR) is **safe as long as the model to be loaded was already compiled in advance.** \r\n\r\nHere are also people encountering similar issue:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/53636759/keras-importing-load-model-takes-too-long\r\n\r\nNote that the loading method described above is not directly applicable to DeepPoseKit because: \r\n```\r\n    model_json = model.to_json()\r\nAttributeError: 'StackedDenseNet' object has no attribute 'to_json'\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/558447083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DenisPolygalov","id":18456799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDU2Nzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18456799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov","html_url":"https://github.com/DenisPolygalov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisPolygalov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/565048194","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/31#issuecomment-565048194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/31","id":565048194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTA0ODE5NA==","user":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T15:13:30Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T15:13:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Fixed
