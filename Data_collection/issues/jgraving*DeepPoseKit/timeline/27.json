You could run into accuracy problems if certain keypoints are only rarely visible, so it might be worth adding an online hard keypoint mining (OHKM) loss function at some point to dynamically reweight rare keypoints during training.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/586897295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/587062616","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/27#issuecomment-587062616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/27","id":587062616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NzA2MjYxNg==","user":{"login":"Selmaan","id":5429274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjkyNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5429274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan","html_url":"https://github.com/Selmaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Selmaan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-17T16:06:13Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T16:06:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this!\r\n\r\nI verified that it works, in the annotator (but not downstream training). I'm not sure I totally understand the concern around training. As I understand, 'non visible' points now have their location set to NaN. I could imagine two ways of handling this at training time. (1), the network is trained to predict 0 confidence values across the entire image, (2) The loss for non-visible points is masked out, so that it has no contribution to training. I agree that if implemented as (1) I'm not sure what will happen during training. I had assumed that (2) was the idea here, to simply ignore elements of the loss (keypoint and associated graph components) related to the non-visible point. If implemented as (2), I don't understand why this would cause instability during training?\r\n\r\nAs an aside, something that is an issue at least on windows computers, is that installing DPK with pip causes the opencv version to be changed to opencv-python-headless. I think that's the wrong version, and it causes lots of errors, and it has to be manually uninstalled and opencv-python needs to be manually installed afterwards.

Currently scenario (1) is used at training time as the network has to be optimized to predict zeros when the keypoint isn't visible so the low confidence score can be used to filter non-visible points during inference. However, the graph/skeleton drawing function hasn't been updated to deal with the NaNs, which is why I'd recommend disabling this in the `TrainingGenerator`. \r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be any instability during training with the loss function or optimizer. My comment was pointing out that if non-visible keypoints are predicted as all zeros then the predicted keypoint coordinates will basically be a random coordinate in the image (with low confidence) and the euclidean error metric shown during training may not be a reliable indicator of performance. This metric needs to be updated to only include euclidean error for keypoints above a confidence threshold (e.g. p >= 0.1).\r\n\r\nMy other comment was if specific types of keypoints are only rarely visible within the training set, then the network might just learn to always predict values close to zero, which is why online hard keypoints mining loss is useful, as it detects average error for each keypoint within a training batch and dynamically reweights the top-k highest error keypoints. \r\n\r\nI'll take a look later this week to see if I can implement the changes I described. I'll also look into your comment about the dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/587104034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-18T09:36:32Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T09:36:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/42","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/42/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/42/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/42/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/42","id":566762787,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NjY3NjI3ODc=","number":42,"title":"Fix

This was done for two reasons 1) imgaug doesn't support NaN values for keypoints (or didn't at the time, but perhaps this has been updated), and 2) a large negative value was used so that even after augmentation the keypoint would be outside the coordinate range of the image in order to produce an all zero confidence map. Now that I look at the code perhaps this should be done within the `TrainingGenerator` rather than the `BaseGenerator`. However, would affect visualizations within the examples which would need to be updated to deal with the NaNs as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n> It seems like this could be done using the ground truth visibility rather than implementing a confidence threshold?\r\n\r\nYeah, that's a good point, you're right. I was wrong. Not sure what I was thinking before.

implemented these changes, plus two minor additions.\r\n\r\nFirst, for keypoints which are supposed to be not-visible, it seemed reasonable to replace their confience score with 1 minus the confidence score, for the purposes of reporting online during training, since the target confidence for these points is 0. Euclidean errors however should be masked out, since they are not defined for non-visible keypoints. These changes only affect values printed to command line during training, but not logged values to disk. This is fine, because the keypoint errors logged to disk includes NaN values for non-visible keypoints\r\n\r\nSecond, in debugging these changes, I noticed that the logger callback appeared to be broken. Instead of adding a new entry for each epoch, it appears to have a first entry with all zeros, and a second entry with only the most recent values. This looked like a single line got misplaced outside a conditional statement, and I tested that logger works correctly after making this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/comments/842022342","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/27#issuecomment-842022342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/27","id":842022342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjAyMjM0Mg==","user":{"login":"rubeea","id":11279062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjc5MDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11279062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea","html_url":"https://github.com/rubeea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubeea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T06:08:49Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T06:08:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jgraving Hi, is it possible to annotate multiple object instances with keypoints in the annotator?
