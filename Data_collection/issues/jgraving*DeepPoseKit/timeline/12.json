As @eduramiba pointed out 2.0 is still a bit buggy. The code seems to be most stable with tensorflow 1.14 (`pip install tensorflow~=1.14` or `pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14`). Also is tensorflow printing out anything in your jupyter notebook terminal session? Could you also post a screenshot of your nvidia-smi?
