In this case the minimum receptive field is 2**6 * (3, 3) = (192, 192), which is actually much larger due to stacked 3x3 convolutions and a 7x7 convolution in the first layer of the network. The receptive field may actually be too large, which can also be a problem as the network loses some of its translation invariance in the deepest part of the network.\r\n\r\nI would first try adjusting `n_transitions` to be smaller. The default is -1, which downsamples the images as many times as possible (6 in this case). However, you may need to increase the `growth_rate` or `n_stacks` to increase the number of parameters. Another way to alleviate this problem may be to apply more aggressive augmentation for translating (and perhaps rotating) the image, as this forces the deepest features to preserve translation invariance.\r\n\r\nIf you're using a custom data generator, it may also be useful to set your posture graph to connect the corresponding body parts in the top and bottom of the image. This explicitly forces the network to learn the relationships between them. Adding these confidence maps should be relatively inexpensive for running inference.   \r\n\r\nThe `pretrained` option is also experimental and hasn't been thoroughly benchmarked yet, so there may be a bug how this part of the model is implemented. It might be worth trying `pretrained=False` if you haven't already.

update: I took your suggestions and 1) turned off pre-training and 2) used more severe augmentation (in particular, increasing the resizing to range from .6->1.4).
