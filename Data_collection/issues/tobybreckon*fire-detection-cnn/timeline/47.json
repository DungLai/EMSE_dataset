Install the required packages for virtualenv on Linux Ubuntu 18.10 and then ...\r\n\r\n```\r\nvirtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ./venv/tf-1.1.5-gpu\r\nsource

can post a pull request for a set of TF 2.0 fixes (but as far as I can tell the complexity of such a fix  is way beyond the TF 1.x -> TF 2.x translation scripts
