But I would like to expand the issue because All calculator executes on the image which using CPU and I very confuse when I knew it\r\n\r\nThe network runs on the GPU presently for classification. If you which to also perform the superpixels part on a GPU, I would suggest using GSLIC for this part instead - https://github.com/carlren/gSLICr or similar.\r\n\r\n> I have a question? How do I detect fire on the image (a type of Bounding box ???)\r\n\r\nThis network does not perform that by default - but the superpixels approach can do this by combining it with the Douglas-Pecker contour algorithm and taking the min/max bounds of the contour - see the pinned PAQ issue post for details.\r\n\r\nFor more details of what the code does - please read the accompanying research paper.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/comments/552820336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/comments/553283261","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/33#issuecomment-553283261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/33","id":553283261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzI4MzI2MQ==","user":{"login":"NguyenThaiHoc1","id":22360388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzYwMzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22360388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1","html_url":"https://github.com/NguyenThaiHoc1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NguyenThaiHoc1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T07:55:29Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T07:55:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank professor for response !
