(93% as described).\r\n\r\nYes, and we have independently repeated this in a later paper based on the same code base - https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09010\r\n\r\nDifferent authors, different hardware environment, same dataset, same training optimization ... same results.\r\n\r\nThere is always some randomisation in CNN training due to the random initialisation of weights and the stochastic nature of backpropagation. I note so you are using a different operating system environment to that originally used, which will of course have a a difference in the the underlying GPU software stack.\r\n\r\n> Did you use other image processing or augmentation parameters? \r\n\r\nNo but I note that as per the FAQ we did **not** normalise our pixel values to the range 0 to 1 and we used BGR channel ordering, the OpenCV default, rather than RGB channel ordering for the training - this will vary depending on the data loader in use.\r\n\r\n> Is it effective if I use this model to classify whether a small flame in a picture, such as a active gas stove in a kitchen?\r\n\r\nYes this should be possible. I would suggest training on examples of this type of flame, potentially using transfer learning have a pretrained on the dataset provided.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/comments/595055856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3099862432,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA5OTg2MjQzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/events/3099862432","actor":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-05T06:43:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/comments/595786916","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/45#issuecomment-595786916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/45","id":595786916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTc4NjkxNg==","user":{"login":"Bao150297","id":44353216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzUzMjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44353216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297","html_url":"https://github.com/Bao150297","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bao150297/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-06T14:16:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T14:17:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I noted that you has implement a new network based on ResNet architecture, but seem that the download link for the new paper is no longer.
