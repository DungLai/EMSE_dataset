@791188299 - did this work?\r\nremove dropout layer  it still work correctly\r\nrerun conversion to .pb file no problem\r\nretry conversion with MMdnn ,it gets  an errors about LRN layer parameter when makeing net . \r\nignore that parameter, successful convert to caffe .the test results with firenet are correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/comments/490310297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"791188299","id":50126320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTI2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50126320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299","html_url":"https://github.com/791188299","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2325896945,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMyNTg5Njk0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/events/2325896945","actor":{"login":"791188299","id":50126320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTI2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50126320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299","html_url":"https://github.com/791188299","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-08T01:17:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2325896947,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMjU4OTY5NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/events/2325896947","actor":{"login":"791188299","id":50126320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTI2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50126320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299","html_url":"https://github.com/791188299","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/791188299/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-08T01:17:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/comments/490357522","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/15#issuecomment-490357522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/15","id":490357522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDM1NzUyMg==","user":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T05:54:10Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T05:54
