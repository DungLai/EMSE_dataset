It communicates everything very clearly and was a joy to read. The findings will be definitely very useful in my own research. I have a few questions I'd like to ask.\r\n\r\nQ1: Given that classes 'fire' and 'no fire' are mutually exclusive; what is the rationale for using two separate outputs? Does it have some benefits over having a single output [0-1] and thresholding it appropriately?\r\n\r\nQ2: Could you tell me how do you sample the validation set? I found that the usual technique of randomly sampling 10-20% of the training set doesn't really work for me. Such a random subset of the training set contains images very similar to the ones remaining in the training set and isn't a good measure of out-of-sample error. \r\n\r\nQ3: (This might also help answer Q2). My understanding is that you don't use the entire dataset of 365,702 images, but only a subset of 23,408 images. Could you elaborate how do you pick the 6.4% of images you use?","closed_by":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
