I have some questions:\r\n- Did you use the same optimizer in `fireNet.py` file to produce that result? (93% as described).\r\n- Did you use other image processing or augmentation parameters? If the answer is yes, can you provide it?\r\n- Is it effective if I use this model to classify whether a small flame in a picture, such as a active gas stove in a kitchen? (of course the same data will appear in the training set)\r\nThank in advance.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
