Direct download URL are provided in [README](https://github.com/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/).\r\n\r\n**Known issue (late Sept. 2019, now fixed):**  the file on the server may be moved to a cache due to popularity of the download. The server issues an http redirect but the scripts (prior to recent update) did not follow these http directive. Now fixed with the addition of ``-L`` to the curl command in the download script. Solution: ``git pull`` to get latest version of the repo, then retry download script command - see [README](https://github.com/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/). If using the direct URL specified, make sure your download tool also follows http redirect directives (most browsers do this automatically).","closed_by":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
