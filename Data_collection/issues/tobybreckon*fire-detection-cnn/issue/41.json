I'm working on a smart fire fighting sprinkler that would direct water exactly to the burning area after the detection of fire and I'm using raspberry pi for the processing of the frames. I was wondering if this project can be further edited to have a a bounding box or a contour surrounding the exact location of fire in the frames detected in real-time, not exactly as the output of the \"superpixel-inceptionV1OnFire.py\". Any suggestions or pieces of advice is appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"tobybreckon","id":3429179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon","html_url":"https://github.com/tobybreckon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobybreckon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobybreckon/fire-detection-cnn/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
