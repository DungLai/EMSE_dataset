After commented out the dropout layer, I got the tensorflow pb file and the opencv dnn test worked well. Then, I converted the .pb file to mxnet models with MMdnn successfully. But the predictions is inconsistent  the opencv dnn test. Before prediction, the image the resized to 224*224. I want to know whether data preprocessing is required.
