I'm trying to train the model on CIFAR-10 first, but I found that the setting of the training process on CIFAR-10 is similar to ImageNet, which requires a latent vector z and a class label y as inputs. But in most papers, CIFAR-10 is mainly used for unsupervised GAN, which only takes a latent vector z. Therefore, is there a way to train the model on CIFAR-10 in an unsupervised manner? \r\n\r\nBy the way, when I directly run the training script of training on CIFAR-10, the log shows that the FID score sometimes turns to NaN. What's the reason behind it?\r\n\r\nThanks you very much!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"songyh10","id":4233990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzM5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4233990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10","html_url":"https://github.com/songyh10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
