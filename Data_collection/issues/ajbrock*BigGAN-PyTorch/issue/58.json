But in get_data_loaders function in utils, it seems like 'train_transform' was not applied and I could not find appropriate image preprocessing/transformation applied anywhere upstream or downstream in the data-feeding pipeline if using hdf5. Would you care to explain why 'train_transform'  was not applied if using dataset format hdf5? Or if it was applied, would you point out exactly where it was applied? Thanks very much!
