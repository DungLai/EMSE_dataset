But considering the cost of time, we hope to train biggan on TPU, so we use a version of tensorflow code that looks close to yours(**https://github.com/Octavian-ai/BigGAN-TPU-TensorFlow**). But many of the attempts turned out to be bad. Can you continue to release the official biggan code of TPU version?\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nconfig:\r\nImagenet2012\r\ntf-1.12.2\r\nGCP v3-8 pod\r\ntraining for up to 300k steps\r\n\r\nSome failed results:\r\n100k:\r\n![100k samples](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41911374/67184786-17aab780-f417-11e9-819e-4426d4f19cd0.png)\r\n180k:\r\n![180k samples](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41911374/67184797-1d080200-f417-11e9-98e6-21195a01c2c4.png)\r\n300k:\r\n![300k samples](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41911374/67184803-2002f280-f417-11e9-93e4-0dea2fbe2ec1.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
