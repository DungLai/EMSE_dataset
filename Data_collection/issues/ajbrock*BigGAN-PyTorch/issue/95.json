I was wondering if anyone has previously tried training BigGAN for generating images conditioned on the text description. If we just change the `nn.Embedding` to `nn.Linear` in place of class condition embedding then will it work. If anyone can share some pointers regarding modifying BigGAN for text-to-image then it would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/95/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/95/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
