It has finished 134k iterations and here is the log file. \r\n<img width=\"1381\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-16 at 9 33 58 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31877208/57863220-516bf800-77bf-11e9-9031-0399d221e6bd.png\">\r\n\r\nCompare with the log file that you released, I got the worse results. I kept all the parameters as same as your default settings. The training is on 8xV100. Do you have any suggestion to make it better? Or what should I check to get a similar result as yours?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
