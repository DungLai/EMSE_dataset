In such dataset, we only have about 50 images per class.\r\nI have tried to run BigGAN on the birds dataset, however, the result doesn't look very nice (worse than baseline models)... since BigGAN is a large model, does it need a large dataset to perform well?","closed_by":{"login":"ajbrock","id":7751273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7751273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
