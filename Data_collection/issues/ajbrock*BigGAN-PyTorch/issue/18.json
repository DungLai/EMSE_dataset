I tried to use the discriminator for 128 models and I think it is a conditional discriminator. Is there any chance to convert it to an unconditional discriminator? Please correct me if I misunderstand anything about it. \r\nThank so much!","closed_by":{"login":"ajbrock","id":7751273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7751273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
