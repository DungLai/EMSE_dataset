I have modified num_classess and made sure that the checkpoint can be loaded into the model, but when I run it, it gave me this Error. I cannot figure out what else config maybe left out. Do I need to modify the number of classes of inception_v3 model? \r\n\r\n\r\n1/488 (  0.00%) Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"../train.py\", line 228, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"../train.py\", line 224, in main\r\n    run(config)\r\n  File \"../train.py\", line 184, in run\r\n    metrics = train(x, y)\r\n  File \"/cache/code/BigGAN-PyTorch/train_fns.py\", line 58, in train\r\n    D.optim.step()\r\n  File \"/root/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/optim/adam.py\", line 93, in step\r\n    exp_avg.mul_(beta1).add_(1 - beta1, grad)\r\nRuntimeError: The size of tensor a (1000) must match the size of tensor b (10) at non-singleton dimension 0","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
