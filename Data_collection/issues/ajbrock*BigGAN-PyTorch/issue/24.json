It requires a specific setup where we use `torch.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(...)` instead of `nn.DataParallel(...)` and launch a separate process for each GPU.\r\n\r\nI wrote a small step-by-step here: [https://github.com/dougsouza/pytorch-sync-batchnorm-example](https://github.com/dougsouza/pytorch-sync-batchnorm-example).\r\n\r\nIn my experiments SyncBatchnorm worked well. Also, using  `torch.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(...)` with one process per GPU provides a huge speed up in training. The gain of adding more GPUs is almost linear, it performs a lot faster than `nn.DataParallel(...)`. I believe you could reduce training time drastically by switching to `torch.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(...)`.\r\n\r\nBTW, thanks for this implementation!","closed_by":{"login":"ajbrock","id":7751273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7751273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
