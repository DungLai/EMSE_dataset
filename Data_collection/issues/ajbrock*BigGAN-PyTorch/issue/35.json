The training is working as expected, but I keep noticing the outputs from the GAN have holes in them. See example below.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it is a matter of training for longer, or rather that the training data is not very clean. But when I tried the same with a different cleaner dataset (for a different class), I still noticed a hole in all the outputs, even after training for longer. \r\n\r\nI am using 4 GPUs, with a batch size of 40 and `--num_G_accumulations 4 --num_D_accumulations 4`.\r\n\r\n**I am wondering if anyone ran in the same issue? and what could be the problem?**\r\n\r\nI included an example below: you can see the hole in the center of the image.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7484421/60254550-11bc2400-98c6-11e9-8b9c-76d094a34b60.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"christegho","id":7484421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODQ0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7484421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho","html_url":"https://github.com/christegho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/35/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
