Thanks for your great work! \r\nI have a question about the hinge loss of the generator(line 28 in losses.py). It seems that this may cause negative loss and it is actually negative on my own task(same loss but not this task). There's also such occasion when the generator loss is negative in WGAN-GP.\r\nHow to explain the negative loss?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/60/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/60/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
