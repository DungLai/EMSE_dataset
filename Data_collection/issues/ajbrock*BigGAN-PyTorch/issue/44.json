Don't know if I understand it correctly, but it seems to me that in function utils.get_data_loaders\r\ntrain_set is a vanilla data loader that read through all the data once, namely one epoch of data.\r\nsampler is a MultiEpochSampler whose length is len(train_set) * num_epoch.\r\nWhile in training, it's a nested loop that iterates through sampler for num_epoch times. In total, the model is trained on num_epoch^2 * len(train_set) images, and the \"real\" epoch is actually num_epoch^2.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's on purpose or a bug.
