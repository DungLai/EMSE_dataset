Should it be self.norm_style? In the definition of groupnorm function in L259, the norm_style could have the format of \"ch_32\" or \"grp_16\", but if this norm_style is the self.norm_style in L322, it could only be a choice of \"bn\", \"ln\", \"in\", or \"gn\". Therefore, I feel quite confused about the function here. Could you give some more explanations?
