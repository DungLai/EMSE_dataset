Is my code correct? Especially the preparation of y_.\r\n2. How to preprocess x? I use imagenet val 2012. \r\n2. How to understand the output of D? I find the value could be positive or negative, I am wondering to know which region means Discriminator think the input is fake/real?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.
