Do anyone know where this discrepancy is cropping in from?\r\n\r\nAlso the `init_weights` function in the BigGAN.py only initializes the weight parameters. One should also initialize the bias parameters.\r\n\r\nFinally I fail to assert which dataset Table1 of the the original paper - `'Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis'` refers to.
