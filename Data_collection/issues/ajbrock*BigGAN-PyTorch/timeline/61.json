However I found that simply wrap the original Pytorch BigGAN into a TPU-enable version seems to be super slow since there're some ops that requires context switching between CPU and TPU(e.g. interpolate2d in `torch-xla-1.6` and `torch-xla-1.7`). This repo https://github.com/giannisdaras/smyrf/tree/master/examples/tpu_biggan trains celebA using small batch size (64 global batch size while global batch size >=512 for imagenet). Also when testing for FID/IS, it turns out that there's something wrong thus leading to idle-TPU situation. \r\nBTW, what do you mean by 'tensorfolks'? If you know other implementations for BigGAN on TPUs, please keep me posted.
