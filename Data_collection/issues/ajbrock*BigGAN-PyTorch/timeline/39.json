Jakub,\r\n\r\nWith the standard `nn.DataParallel` implementation in this code the first GPU does tend to have a slightly higher memory usage for a variety of reasons (I think sampling might still incur a high VRAM cost). It's never been an issue for me during training, though, and I don't think it's ever been more than like a gig of difference. The way the `G_D` module is set up should do a lot to minimize this artifact.\r\n\r\nAlso note that I don't use docker or GCP, I use conda environments on an inter-university server.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust sanity checking, what batch size, image size, `num_accumulations,` and model size (`G_ch`, `D_ch`, and deep vs non-deep) are you using, along with how many V100s, memory per V100, and CUDA/CUDNN/PyTorch versions they're on? There's a lot of variables for this kind of thing. \r\n\r\nAlso, just a general debugging tip, if you're running out of memory, the easiest way to see the limit is to start with a small batch size (1 or 2 per device) and crank it up until things run out.
