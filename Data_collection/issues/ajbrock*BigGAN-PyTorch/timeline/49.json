The reason for NaN FID value could be small number of samples (<2048). You can see two different frechet distance computation methods in inception_utils.py . As default it uses the 'torch' method. So try the 'numpy' method instead of 'torch'. I hope it works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/549129721/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"damlasena","id":53898750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODk4NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53898750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena","html_url":"https://github.com/damlasena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2765904081,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2NTkwNDA4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/events/2765904081","actor":{"login":"doantientai","id":14870898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14870898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai","html_url":"https://github.com/doantientai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-03T12:01:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2765904083,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjU5MDQwODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/events/2765904083","actor":{"login":"doantientai","id":14870898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14870898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai","html_url":"https://github.com/doantientai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-03T12:01:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/549550632","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/49#issuecomment-549550632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/49","id":549550632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTU1MDYzMg==","user":{"login":"doantientai","id":14870898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODcwODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14870898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai","html_url":"https://github.com/doantientai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doantientai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-04T21:16:13Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T08:34:37Z","autho
