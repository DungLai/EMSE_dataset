As that section indicates, BigGAN collapse is not successfully mitigated by any one of a variety of normalization, clipping, or clamping strategies, even though they successfully treat the symptoms of spectral explosion. (Spectral Explosion is also probably an attack from a ghost anime). If you want to try SV clamping for your own experiments, all the tools are provided if you subclass an `SN` layer and implement eq (4).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/602105423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ajbrock","id":7751273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7751273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3152104328,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE1MjEwNDMyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/events/3152104328","actor":{"login":"ajbrock","id":7751273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7751273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-21T21:12:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/602107447","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/57#issuecomment-602107447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/57","id":602107447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjEwNzQ0Nw==","user":{"login":"johntiger1","id":14852840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODUyODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14852840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1","html_url":"https://github.com/johntiger1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johntiger1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-21T21:30:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T21:31:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Wow, thanks for the quick reply!
