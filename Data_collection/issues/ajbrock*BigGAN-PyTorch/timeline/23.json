What's your FID score on cifar10? It is really hard to compare with other papers on the performance of cifar10, as in other papers they use an unsupervised training setting, while here we use a cGAN setting for training.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/504237709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"songyh10","id":4233990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzM5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4233990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10","html_url":"https://github.com/songyh10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2428903647,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQyODkwMzY0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/events/2428903647","actor":{"login":"feifei-Liu","id":37265875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjY1ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37265875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu","html_url":"https://github.com/feifei-Liu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-20T23:45:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2428903648,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0Mjg5MDM2NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/events/2428903648","actor":{"login":"feifei-Liu","id":37265875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjY1ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37265875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu","html_url":"https://github.com/feifei-Liu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifei-Liu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-20T23:45:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/504238351","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/23#issuecomment-504238351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/23","id":504238351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDIzODM1MQ==","user":{"login":"songyh10","id":4233990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzM5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4233990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10","html_url":"https://github.com/songyh10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyh10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T23:49:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T23:49:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

@ajbrock,\r\n\r\nI have been working to run the BigGAN code on another image data set which I created. The data set consists of two classes with 256x256 sized images. I tried to retune the training parameters due to the fact that I am using a single Titan XP (~12 GB RAM). First, I read your suggestions about previous memory issues. Then, I applied following modifications to training arguments:\r\n\r\n1. remove the 'load_in_mem' argument\r\n2. decrease the batch size\r\n3. increase the number of accumulations(num_G_accumulations and num_D_accumulations) to overcome the small batch size problem\r\n4. decrease the channel multipliers(G_ch and D_ch) but still try to keep it in high values\r\n5. add '--which_best FID' argument\r\n6. small modifications showed in the attached script \r\n\r\nYou can compare your parameters with mine [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZfbQeR4Q6aLm43gSMsxWd98lS1cBcg5y/view?usp=sharing) During whole training, my IS and FID values were terrible.
