This will probably be slower but if you're constrained by your harddrive space while training on ImageNet (you'll need space to save model checkpoints as well) it is one way to save disk space.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/513586450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ajbrock","id":7751273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7751273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2498239823,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ5ODIzOTgyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/events/2498239823","actor":{"login":"ajbrock","id":7751273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7751273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-21T20:48:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/513611573","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/38#issuecomment-513611573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/38","id":513611573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzYxMTU3Mw==","user":{"login":"ellismarte","id":10035660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM1NjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10035660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte","html_url":"https://github.com/ellismarte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ellismarte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T01:52:53Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T01:52:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
