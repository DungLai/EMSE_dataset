@christegho, I tried group normalization instead of batch normalization on the code. According to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08494.pdf) GN is more successful than BN for small batch sizes. However, it didn't work, I still take poor results. Do you have any other suggestion to improve the learning for small batch sizes? It's just because I have no option to increase the resources.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/comments/539554013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"damlasena","id":53898750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODk4NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53898750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena","html_url":"https://github.com/damlasena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damlasena/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2695747682,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY5NTc0NzY4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/issues/events/2695747682","actor":{"login":"christegho","id":7484421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODQ0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7484421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho","html_url":"https://github.com/christegho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christegho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-08T14:57:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
