For smaller datasets, I'd recommend using EMA and the BigGAN architectural tricks (shared embeddings, hierarchical latents, truncation and maybe ortho reg) but you probably don't want an actual Big model for this problem. \r\n\r\nLearning from scarce data is an open research question in general, and there's tons of work on low-shot learning (and plenty of generative models trained on CUB-200).
