Could you please confirm?\r\n\r\nRegarding the pytorch error, it arises because the models currently available were saved with pytorch version 0.3.1. You might be trying with a more recent pytorch version? \r\n\r\nLoading a model in pytorch is backward compatible but not forward compatible (see [here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/loading-pre-trained-bninception-in-pytorch-0-4/21966)). A quick fix is to install an older pytorch using one of the wheel files from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/). \r\n\r\nI will update the .pth file to support a more recent pytorch version later this week. But, with pytorch v0.3.1, the test script should work, if you want to try it out right away.\r\n\r\nIf these fixes are satisfactory, could you please close the issue?
