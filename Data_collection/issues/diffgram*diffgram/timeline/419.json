Vitalii:\r\n\r\n1. Right, this one should only show up when the `job.allow_reviews` is true, status = `in_review` and the user viewing it is the assigned reviewer.\r\n2. Yes, it should show it when the reviewer hits the \"complete\" button. In this case the button should be a \"Complete review\" button instead of a \"Complete task\" button. So it should show only if the reviewer is assigned, other users should not be able to add reviews unless added as reviewers.\r\n3. For the reviewer selection, I think we can remove that as now the system is assigning the reviewer automatically. The dialog should just show an approve/reject button, and a text field to add some comments to it. You don't have to worry about the reviewer selection as the system will assign it automatically to the reviewer with less tasks assigned at the current moment.\r\n4. Yes, we can provide a text comment box on the status. You can see the `discussion_comment_new.vue` component to see the current text box we have for comments. Also the `/api/v1/task/<int:task_id>/review` Url accepts the `comment` key on the payload to send the text there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/970500221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5626843996,"node_id":"COE_lADOCM48Rc4-WFeKzwAAAAFPYtNc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/5626843996","actor":{"login":"vitalii-bulyzhyn","id":46309116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzA5MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46309116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn","html_url":"https://github.com/vitalii-bulyzhyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-16T18:06:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5668109573,"node_id":"CE_lADOCM48Rc4-WFeKzwAAAAFR2H0F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/5668109573","actor":{"login":"vitalii-bulyzhyn","id":46309116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzA5MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46309116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn","html_url":"https://github.com/vitalii-bulyzhyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitalii-bulyzhyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-24T16:28:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
