edited my rough code idea to be slightly better - please note that sample is just an idea to illustrate mental idea :)\r\n\r\nA few more notes copy and pasted from discussion:\r\nEspecially for a 10,000+ frame video with a lot of sequences and instances in most frames, then this could make a bigger impact\r\nThe context is that, if there are multiple sequences effected in one save, for videos with many frames with instances, it takes a long time to re-save that many numbers when stored as literal [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... n].\r\n\r\nAgain a +1 for first checking if this keyframe thing is even an issue.\r\n\r\nRelated, segments of keyframes may be a useful direction to think about for UI stuff, and QA feature. Understanding these segments (within a sequence) will likely start to matter more. For example detecting gaps in segments that are unexpected

was doing a bit more research on this issue, and I've found the following insights.\r\n\r\n- I'm doing test updates on tables with more than 2000 items and they are taking 2ms\r\n- The same query seems to take 100s on another occasion.\r\n- This is making me think that the problem is more a locking problem, than a table, or columns size problem.\r\n- So a theory is that: the cache updating takes a lot of time, and after a threshold it times out. This could leave the connection open due to and then other update sequence queries would be waiting for the image preview update to finish since the update could potentially lock the sequence.\r\n\r\nSo maybe a possible solutions is just parallelizing the sequences updates in frontend so that the updates are faster, and the rows unlocked more often.\r\n\r\nWe could try this and then allowing normal saving of sequences again to test it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/906772687/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5235289169,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ1MjM1Mjg5MTY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/5235289169","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T21:23:06Z","assignee":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5396697352,"node_id":"COE_lADOCM48Rc46ZFvCzwAAAAFBqxEI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/5396697352","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T20:39:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5396697750,"node_id":"CE_lADOCM48Rc46ZFvCzwAAAAFBqxKW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/5396697750","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/user
