@MathijsNL,\r\n\r\nGood catch on this one!\r\n\r\nI think what we can do for this is just replace the `\"db\"` string on the command to the ENV variable that includes only the postgres host. \r\n\r\nTo do this I think these ideas can work:\r\n\r\n1. On the `install.py` script. We can modify the function:\r\n```\r\n    def database_config(self):\r\n        local_database = bcolors.inputcolor(\r\n            'Do you want to use the local database? Y/N [Press Enter to use Local DB]: ')\r\n        local_database = local_database.lower()\r\n        if local_database == 'y' or local_database == '':\r\n            self.local_database = True\r\n        else:\r\n            self.local_database = False\r\n            valid = False\r\n            while not valid:\r\n                database_url = bcolors.inputcolor(\r\n                    '\\n\\n >> Please enter the Remote Postgres Database URL\\n    NOTE: The syntax for URL is: \"postgresql+psycopg2://<db_username>:<db_pass>@/<db_name>?host=<db_host>\": ',\r\n                    bcolors.OKBLUE)\r\n\r\n                bcolors.printcolor('Testing DB Connection...', bcolors.WARNING)\r\n                try:\r\n                    # Testing connection\r\n                    engine = create_engine(database_url)\r\n                    conn = engine.connect()\r\n                    conn.close()\r\n                    valid = True\r\n                    self.database_url = database_url\r\n                    bcolors.printcolor('✓ DB connection succesful!', bcolors.OKGREEN)\r\n                    time.sleep(2)\r\n                except Exception as e:\r\n                    bcolors.printcolor(\r\n                        'Connection test failed: Please check that your DB URL has the correct values and try again.',\r\n                        bcolors.FAIL)\r\n                    bcolors.printcolor('Error data: {}'.format(str(e)), bcolors.FAIL)\r\n                    valid = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that we can extract the host_name from the `self.database_url` and save it on a new attribute `self.db_host`.\r\n\r\nThen on the  `populate_env()` function in `install.py` we can add a new line similar to this:\r\n\r\n`            env_file += 'DATABASE_HOST={}\\n'.format(self.db_host)`\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to have the host on a separate env variable.\r\n\r\nWe can the just reference this on the command like this:\r\n`\r\ncommand: [\"/app/db-init.sh\", ${DATABASE_HOST} \"python3\", \"-u\", \"/app/main.py\"]`\r\n\r\nI'm not quire sure if we have to add the double quotes or not to the env variable reference but the would be the main idea. Also for the password. we would have to implement something similar.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on this
