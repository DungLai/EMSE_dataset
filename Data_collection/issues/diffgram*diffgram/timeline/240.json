PR will close #240  I think.\r\n\r\n.bmp, .tif and .tiff files will be supported. Original file will go to raw files and a PNG with compress_level=4 is generated because it feels like a good tradeoff between the required processing power and the space saved. Feel free to adjust this as needed. \r\n\r\nBecause thumbnail would be generated with the native file extension this approach didn't work. All thumbnails will be generated as JPG with quality=95.\r\n\r\nIf a new extension gets requested it can be added to the same list as .bmp, .tif and .tiff as long as imageio can read and write it the same way as the other extensions.\r\n\r\n@PJEstrada I changed the thumbnail extension to JPG because it is a thumbnail and you don't really see the difference with PNG. It is slightly smaller and blazing fast. It is in a separate commit, so you can also get the thumbnails as .PNG.\r\n\r\nHere is a small comparison between a JPG and PNG thumbnail to visualize it\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1612886/154782571-d5488271-174e-4cf5-882d-c24d7427fa0b.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6113110910,"node_id":"CE_lADOCM48Rc458fXizwAAAAFsXqt-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6113110910","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-21T17:17:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
