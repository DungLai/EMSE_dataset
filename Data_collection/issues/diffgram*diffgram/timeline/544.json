This was a mistake because it's a highly interactive concept and does not align well with backend. So we want to move the existing and new interpolation methods to the frontend.\r\n\r\nThe secondary item is that it may be a good opportunity to build it on top of the userscript concepts. Whatever work is required to do that e.g. primitives to easily fetch next frame etc. - is worth it to further that concept. That would also give faster customization options for any missing cases. \r\n \r\nhttps://diffgram.readme.io/docs/userscripts-overview\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1024748055/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anthony-sarkis","id":18080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis","html_url":"https://github.com/anthony-sarkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5974058364,"node_id":"LE_lADOCM48Rc5CokCfzwAAAAFkFOV8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/5974058364","actor":{"login":"anthony-sarkis","id":18080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis","html_url":"https://github.com/anthony-sarkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-28T23:47:19Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"E49EC3"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
