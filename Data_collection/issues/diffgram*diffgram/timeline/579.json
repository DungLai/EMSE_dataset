The only thing I can tell you is that Diffgram does not store any data from your S3 files on its DB. We only store signed URL's to the data. There are some temp files that are stored during upload, but those are deleted right after upload finishes\r\n\r\n The actual raw files always stay on the blob storage backend (either aws, gpc or azure). So if you install diffgram on a private server, this private server will only have access to the files via the signed URLs.

@PJEstrada \r\nThank you very much for that quick answer.\r\n- I think even if diffgram on the private server has access to those URLs, it's the responsibility of the private server(that means, us :) ) , not to get hacked. So that sounds good.\r\n- Since they are presigned urls, I think that means anyone can access them without creds. If Diffgram is installed on a private server, do these presigned urls leave that private server at any point? for e.g. usage metrics that you may collect for feature development. I think the answer is no, but sorry I have to ask :(. It's part of a check.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1033847020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RAbraham","id":214189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham","html_url":"https://github.com/RAbraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6034991714,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCM48Rc5DM8YEzwAAAAFntqpi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6034991714","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-09T14:55:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6034991720,"node_id":"SE_lADOCM48Rc5DM8YEzwAAAAFntqpo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6034991720","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-09T14:55:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1033970136","html_url":"https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/579#issuecomment-1033970136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/579","id":1033970136,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM48Rc49oSHY","user":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-09T16:46:47Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T16:46:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"At this current point there should not be any signed urls being sent out of the diffgram server.
