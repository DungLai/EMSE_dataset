You're right, for now we still don't yet support pagination at the UI level, but if you just select the entire `batch_1/` folder, and unselect the individual files, it should fetch all the items on the folder regardless of not showing them on the UI. \r\n\r\nWe will add a separate issue to support pagination on the file browser for really large folders on the UI.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this works for you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/883022685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
