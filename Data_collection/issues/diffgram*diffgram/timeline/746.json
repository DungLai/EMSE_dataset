You're right, the exposed port should be 8082. It's not conflicting with the other service since the port mapping is exposing the port 8082 and in this case walrus has nothing on port 8080. But I think it's something we'll need to avoid confusions on the docker compose file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1069093595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6250674276,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCM48Rc5FyVoRzwAAAAF0kbhk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6250674276","actor":{"login":"otecfuras","id":11886445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODg2NDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11886445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras","html_url":"https://github.com/otecfuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T12:51:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6250674283,"node_id":"SE_lADOCM48Rc5FyVoRzwAAAAF0kbhr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6250674283","actor":{"login":"otecfuras","id":11886445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODg2NDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11886445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras","html_url":"https://github.com/otecfuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T12:51:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1069133700","html_url":"https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/746#issuecomment-1069133700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/746","id":1069133700,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM48Rc4_ua-E","user":{"login":"otecfuras","id":11886445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODg2NDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11886445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras","html_url":"https://github.com/otecfuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otecfuras/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-16T13:32:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T13:32:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks,
