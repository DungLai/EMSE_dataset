Making it seems to be the most well scoped to this specific need.\r\n\r\n#### From UI perspective: \r\na user could select an existing polygon and do some action  (hotkey, button etc) to \"add more spatial shapes\" or something.  Then it enters a drawing mode where it populates that data. \r\n\r\n#### Selecting:\r\nany spatial aspect of the shape selects that one instance, so that action should be similar. \r\n\r\n#### Editing:\r\npoints may need extra work since to know which \"subshape\", and may be some oddities there to consider.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical view, the key could not exist (or exist with null value) for most cases and then exist when needed.
