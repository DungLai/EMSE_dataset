takeaways for this:\r\n- Currently we are not calling identify_user() for some reason on the eventhub \r\n- identify_user always fails on opensource so we need to send it via an http request to

data.\r\n- We need to provide the install fingerprint on most of the event creations and send it to segment too.\r\n- We need to figure out the main way to bind subsequent events on segment after the
