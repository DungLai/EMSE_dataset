I've been enjoying my first times using Diffgram except for one thing, which is the behavior near the edges of images. I'm trying to put polygonal masks on an image, but when I try to pan to the edge the image glitches out and vibrates, preventing me from seeing the edges well. When I press \"z\" and then move the mouse towards the edge to pan that way, the view starts vibrating/bouncing rapidly and often doesn't end up showing the edge. This happens more when the mouse is moved fast but happens as well when moving slowly.a\r\n\r\nYou also can use the \"zoom-in, zoom-out\" to move around in most of the image, but you can't use this at the end because zooming doesn't work once the mouse is outside of the image frame. If you try to zoom inside the image frame you lose bits along the edge.\r\n\r\nAttached is a screencap video I made of the behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3709527/169611501-ab165e37-94fd-4b55-a5a9-28d9ab7574d3.mp4\r\n\r\nIdeally when panning to an edge the view would smoothly stop and expose the whole image, or even have a little buffer around the image (enableable?) if that makes things easier to view.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/864/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
