wondering if the previous deployed image was already named master?\r\n\r\nThe thing is that k8s updates pods based on a tag name change so for exampl if we have\r\n\r\n`default-service:0.12.81`\r\n\r\nand then we deploy master which is \r\n\r\n`default-service:master`\r\n\r\nK8s will detech a tag name change and redeploy pods.\r\n\r\nHowever if we had previously a `master` tag:\r\n\r\n\r\n`default-service:master`\r\n\r\nAnd we re-tag master with a new codebase. If we deploy again with:\r\n\r\n\r\n`default-service:master`\r\n\r\nK8s will not detech changes even if the tag name now contains new code. This is because the standard is that each tag should be an inmutable artifact/version of the system.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially add something like `master-UUID`, but it might be a bit hard to track this when more and more tags are created. I think best solution is to always default to a tag release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1095168402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
