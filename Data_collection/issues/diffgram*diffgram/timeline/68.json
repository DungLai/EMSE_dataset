DIFFGRAM_STATIC_STORAGE_PROVIDER`. This tells Diffgram what cloud storage provided you are using (gcp, azure, aws).\n\nIf you have it set to `gcp` you will need to set the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FULL_PATH` to the path where your GCP service account JSON file is. So the error might be becuase that value is not set.\n\nIf you are not using GCP, just change the `diffgramSettings. DIFFGRAM_STATIC_STORAGE_PROVIDER` to either azure or aws and make sure to provide the credentials values in the `values.yaml` file.\n\nI think the tutorial fails to explain that, I will make sure to update it to point this out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/846306779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4781657537,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc4MTY1NzUzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/4781657537","actor":{"login":"amrlafi","id":40797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi","html_url":"https://github.com/amrlafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-21T23:21:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4781657540,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3ODE2NTc1NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/4781657540","actor":{"login":"amrlafi","id":40797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi","html_url":"https://github.com/amrlafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-21T23:21:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/846377198","html_url":"https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/68#issuecomment-846377198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/68","id":846377198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjM3NzE5OA==","user":{"login":"amrlafi","id":40797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi","html_url":"https://github.com/amrlafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrlafi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-22T08:52:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T08:52:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
