In order to get to the root cause of this I wanted to ask for a bit more information,\r\n\r\n1, Can you go to the \"Stream Events\" section in the project menu and check if there are any pending/failed stream events?\r\n2. Did you notice any error on the logs during the uploads of the files?\r\n3. Did you turned off the docker containers anytime during the upload?\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we'll work on a force resync on missing files buttton so you can re sync the tasks of the dataset.
