Adds Custom UI Schema Controls\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/78e71d30405c4331a186b3da77ee4c8f\r\n\r\nV1 Has some rough edges\r\nStill WIP for the HTTP end points to save the schema DB\r\nAnd to wire that to tasks etc\r\n\r\nDirectionally this will be a 'great what you see is what you get' way to further customize the UI.\r\nIt will also help support other UI customizations like enable and disable features, alternate styles etc.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/135976329-328cb895-ca4e-4679-b42d-9bec7f9df3c8.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/135976358-620c9cff-40a3-4f17-9ad1-7a5658a18f3f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/135976418-7d489ca8-4011-4de2-8545-4348af97a001.png)\r\n\r\nAlso fixes image sizing in task mode\r\n\r\n## Add Annotator Focused Screen\r\n![annotator focused screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/136126464-68ba3e8a-6bb8-4cc4-87bd-a063ebdc16fb.png)\r\nA lot of this is UI centric. In terms of new functions, the \"Annotate\" button now\r\n1. Crosscuts jobs. Gets next across project. Means the Annotator does not need to know which job they are working on. Also a starting point to build more around QA centric tasks UI.\r\n2. Uses SkipLock to strengthen guarantees. Concept that we may build this into the \"on complete\" / get next during normal annotation. So if the tasks happen to be small, and there are many annotators, there's a collision chance.\r\n3. https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/commit/9e8e49df5c85e2533ae57b4c76108c7151cf9e8c#diff-e0558f300c30e0d7e278609a6fa9363326ff3dc3871d962f7ceb28cc4f7e809eR316\r\nChecks job ids are either in jobs assigned to user or open to all. \r\n\r\nThe nuance here is that it's project wide, but if the job is assigned to me, or is set to to invite only, then it's not eligible.\r\n\r\nTangent:\r\nNote that for status, we are checking that the status == `available`. The assumption here is the status is the more key thing then the user assigned. We could also check there is no user assigned, but then if an admin wants to assign it to someone else, we would have to expressly clear that or something.\r\n\r\n1. Show assigned users on task view\r\n2. Show in progress\r\n![add assigned user icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/136126491-38f0d26b-73c2-4501-8ea5-86c6af2383e0.PNG)\r\n \r\n\r\n### Cleaner and User Customizable Task Home\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/137419817-0311ba29-3407-4da5-9cc8-62c69caf19bd.png)\r\n\r\n1) Now uses regular table\r\n2) Defaults to show more typical user features\r\n3) Shows annotation count from preview \r\n\r\n### Better task assignment\r\nImproves task assignment concept. \r\n1) From Task Detail Page\r\n2) From Complete/Defer in Annotation\r\n\r\nNow those actions will by default assign the task the user gets to themselves.\r\nTask assignment etc still needs some more work. It's a step in the direction of making that more visible and hardening that\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/339/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
