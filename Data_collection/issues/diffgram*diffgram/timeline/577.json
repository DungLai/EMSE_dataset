for sharing! @RAbraham \r\n\r\nSome notes on the services so you can get more context:\r\n\r\n- Diffgram is made up of 5 services: (default, walrus, frontend, db, dispatcher). Each of those runs on a different port. So depending on what ports are conflicting you just have to focus on changing the conflicting services ports.\r\n\r\n- You don't have to change the `expose:` key on the docker compose as that just exposes the port from the docker container into your host system. You can leave those as they are.\r\n\r\nThe rules you have to change are the `ports:` rules:\r\nYou can read more about it here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/\r\n\r\nBasically the syntax tells the following:\r\n\r\n`ports: \"PORT_TO_MAP_ON_YOUR_MACHINE:PORT_ON_THE_CONTAINER\"`\r\n\r\nSo if you want to change the service that is running on `8080`, which is the `default` service you just have to change that service's `ports:` config to something like:\r\n```\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"0.0.0.0:9080:8080\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means: \"Map the service running on 8080 in docker container to port 9080 on my host machine\".\r\n\r\nSince you just changed the `default` service, there's no need to change any other thing on the `.env` file. So you can return the line:\r\n`WALRUS_SERVICE_URL_BASE=http://walrus:9080/` \r\n\r\nback to how it was before. THis only needs to change if you change the ports of the `walrus` service.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this helps :) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1031690191/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6020825088,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCM48Rc5DIGE0zwAAAAFm3oAA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6020825088","actor":{"login":"RAbraham","id":214189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham","html_url":"https://github.com/RAbraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-07T16:53:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6020825096,"node_id":"SE_lADOCM48Rc5DIGE0zwAAAAFm3oAI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6020825096","actor":{"login":"RAbraham","id":214189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham","html_url":"https://github.com/RAbraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-07T16:53:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1031980817","html_url":"https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/577#issuecomment-1031980817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/577","id":1031980817,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM48Rc49gscR","user":{"login":"RAbraham","id":214189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham","html_url":"https://github.com/RAbraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T22:04:46Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T22:04:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That worked!
