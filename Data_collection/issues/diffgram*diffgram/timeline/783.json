I'm not sure if the dispatcher is the one squashing the error codes, or if the error_handlers are (Which I think have been addressed and fixed to an extent).\r\n\r\nHow I look at the dispatcher is as a non-production \"Ingress\" service (similar to the one in our k8s cluster). \r\n\r\nHowever, the dispatcher is not actually used in k8s cluster. In this context we use an NGINX ingress. We just use the dispatcher when using docker-compose (which is more like a non-production installation in my opinion).\r\n\r\nIf we want to make a production level deployment, I think the dispatcher services might need to be replaced with something like a NGINGX service, or any other service that can act as an api gateway for production environments. But I'm not sure if that's something we need to offer out of the box as there are so many options and tools for that that it might be something that is more up to the devops team/IT department of each company/client.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1087666548/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6365035356,"node_id":"LE_lADOCM48Rc5G_ZjczwAAAAF7Yrtc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/events/6365035356","actor":{"login":"anthony-sarkis","id":18080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis","html_url":"https://github.com/anthony-sarkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-04T17:43:18Z","label":{"name":"lowpriority","color":"7F7089"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/comments/1087837128","html_url":"https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/783#issuecomment-1087837128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/783","id":1087837128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM48Rc5A1xPI","user":{"login":"anthony-sarkis","id":18080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis","html_url":"https://github.com/anthony-sarkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-04T17:43:55Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T17:43:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks Pablo I was forgetting about the nginx ingress.\r\n\r\nIn that case this is probably a fairly low priority.
