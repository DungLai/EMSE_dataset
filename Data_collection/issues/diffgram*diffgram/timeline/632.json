PR will take care of almost all the old .format strings and string concats, I didn't count but if we leave the @routes.route() functions out there is at most 10 files with a few exceptions that need

Example:\r\n```\r\nkind = f\"api_enable_{str(input['api_name'])}\",\r\n```\r\nIt probably won't hurt, and it can most likely be removed. Saving for next iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Not converted\r\nAll instances of @routes.route(). Updating them didn't really improve readability.
