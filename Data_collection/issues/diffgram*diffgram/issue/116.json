This achieves a lot of this tickets goal.\r\n\r\nThe current workaround is to manually recreate the Schema,\r\nOr to use the API/SDK\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThe context here is that currently you _can_ attach different labels to different tasks inside a project, so this is generally applicable to users with 10,000+s of tasks (10s of projects and 100s of task sets).\r\n\r\n## Brainstorm\r\nOne approach would be to first implement V1 of the Schema concept (an abstract set like a dataset that contains the various labels, attributes, spatial templates, label specific permissions, etc).\r\n\r\nThen we can more easily work with multiple Schema's in the same project, and also do things like copy or share Schema's between projects. I like the idea of doing this at the schema level since it would be simpler for a user to think about, and simpler to implement probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/116/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
