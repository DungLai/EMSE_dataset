Similar to green on-hover for point.\r\n- Cursor changes, or some other icon? Intent of further delta between which is going to move.\r\n- Make detection radius for keypoint points slightly larger? Assumption that there's lots of space to grab to move whole object, but I don't want to have to be exactly exactly over the point to move the point?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
