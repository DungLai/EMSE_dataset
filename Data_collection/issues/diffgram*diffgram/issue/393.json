This can cause some confusion due to some buttons disappearing and the user not knowing what the current UI schema is. This is specific for the context of the Studio context, where the UI Schema still has not place to be configured.\r\n\r\nSome ideas here:\r\n\r\n1. Maybe we can add a Project leve UI schema, which could be configured in the project settings menu. That would be the schema for the studio. By default it should use no UI Schema.\r\n2. We could just disable UI schema for the studio context.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
