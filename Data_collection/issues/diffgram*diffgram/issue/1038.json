Let us know what you think :)\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nIt's difficult to reason about top level organizational concepts (datasets, tasks, etc.) when there are multiple files that are related to each other directly.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n1) Multiple views that are related to each other (different camera angles for example)\r\n2) Multiple pages of a document\r\n\r\nPeople end up having to twist their heads thinking about, create many things etc.\r\nBesides not being a great product experience it puts unexpected strain on random parts of the system, eg. things that normal should be fine listing 10 or 100 objects suddenly need to scale to smoothly load 10k etc. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe idea is you could define your \"one thing\" as these a collection of media files.\r\nThen you can treat it like a normal file in Diffgram.\r\n\r\nSo instead of having say 20 images, and then grouping it into a task, then having a burdensome volume of datasets/task templates etc, you create 1 Composable file that has 20 children image files,\r\nand the can use the rest of the Organizational objects as normal.\r\n\r\nExample super rough:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/187762123-07c88224-0652-4051-ab9c-46e994d70880.png)\r\n\r\nMay use the current file browser card to show hidden files. \r\ne.g. user closes a file it goes there\r\nor not open files can be added to main screen from there\r\n\r\nThe min/restore/close buttons are oversized on diagram vs expected real size / visibility \r\ndiagram shows many files at once, can start with just two, etc.\r\n\r\n## Further Context\r\nThe context is seeing a lot of people run into concerns trying to setup organizational schemes, when many would be quite easy if they could just define what \"one\" thing was for their context. \r\n\r\nThe main point is that you define what \"one thing\" means.\r\nThis way it removes a lot of the stress around having so many jobs, datasets etc.\r\n\r\nPlease note this is closely related to but different implementation wise from sensor fusion, video, generally having it in a set etc. It's more about creating a first class citizen for a training data specific organizational problem.\r\n\r\nDB relations and other docs see internal\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\nExample considerations\r\n* Creating tasks for each child file automatically, or config for what \"done\" is considered\r\n* Config on reporting\r\nIn general this would assume it will default that completing a Composable file means one task.\r\n\r\nNaming ideas\r\n* Composable\r\n* Compound\r\n* Multi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1038/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1038/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
