Improved UI experiences\r\n2. More User Persona Focused\r\n3. More customization\r\n\r\nThere's likely always a need for the super admin type abstract views. As we learn more about how people do workflow, there's increasingly an opportunity to build focused experiences on top of the building blocks we already have.\r\n\r\nWe have an example of the start of a new Annotator focused screen here https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/pull/339\r\n\r\nTwo other roles that are top of mind\r\n1. QA Role -> https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/363\r\n2. Workflow Manager -> https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/367\r\n\r\nConcrete examples include\r\n1. Status Filters\r\n2. Default Columns on Tables\r\n3. Buttons etc.\r\n\r\nAs we explore this it should naturally present new opportunities to add new functions too.\r\nI'm sure this is something we will need to iterate a lot on but it seems like a good step\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1e-1NNTQcp8Ln4mW3pTByZ3zv1Dc2Qv_eXEHxY5IjdvA/edit\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/368/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
