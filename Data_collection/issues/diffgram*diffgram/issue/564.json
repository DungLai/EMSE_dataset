Here only top line is marked, the bottom line is not. This applies to `n` connected edges. \r\n\r\nOf note here is that it should NOT automatically extend to all child edges. Since in this example if we imagine the box represents the occlusion, the other nodes are still visible. So while we can mark all edges since that's a visual thing, we can't assume that child nodes will also be occluded.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/152606093-6dd08467-4987-4d54-a939-5805a1330007.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
