During the python install.py the database connection seems to be successful, but in the diffgram_default_1 container it shows the following errors:\r\n\r\n**docker logs diffgram_default_1**\r\npsql: could not translate host name \"db\" to address: Name or service not known\r\nPostgres is unavailable - sleeping\r\npsql: could not translate host name \"db\" to address: Name or service not known\r\nPostgres is unavailable - sleeping\r\npsql: could not connect to server: No route to host\r\n        Is the server running on host \"db\" (172.X.X.X) and accepting\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't found where the host name \"db\" gets defined so I can't fix it right now.  I also have no clue why it tries to connect to a 172.X.X.X IP as I haven't filled that in anywhere.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can point me in the right direction.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
