First step might ask, what types of files to include on the job? (video, 3d, text, audio, all) [We might want to default to select all]\r\n2. If text is selected in the options, we can also ask, what type of labeling to perform? Document labeling, Named entity recognition, CSV row labeling, etc.\r\n3. This values should be saved on the job object and would later be used to decide which files should we create tasks for, and how the labeling UI should be displayed when we open a text annotation task.
