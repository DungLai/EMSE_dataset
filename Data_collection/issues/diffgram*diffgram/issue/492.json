Any of the existing frames get deleted so we only have the latest fetched frames in memory. This causes unnecesary fetches in the future if users go back to previous frames that we already fetched. \r\n\r\nWe need to merge the existing frames with the new frames sent by the API on the `get_video_instance_buffer`  and `get_instance_buffer_parallel` functions.\r\n\r\nWhen doing this change, we also have to consider how the interpolation populates the instances, so that it does not break any of the existing functionality.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/492/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
