In this case we might want to disable normal registration flow to all user so that only an admin can manage this workflow.\r\n\r\nSome Ideas:\r\n- Add `ENABLE_SELF_REGISTRATION` env variable to control this.\r\n- Disable self registration only when OIDC integration is on. (Although in some cases users might want to have both the oidc and the diffgram registration)\r\n\r\nLongterm this is also an opportunity to have a more robust feature flag system to trigger features on/off on demand.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/935/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
