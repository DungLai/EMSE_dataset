new marketing WordPress site has a login button.\r\nBut if already logged in then clicking it takes to already logged in page.\r\n\r\nNot sure how since it's a different app, but ideally if the user is already logged in they should either not see the marketing site at all, or be able to click a \"go to app\" type button that takes them to some homepage location in the app\r\n\r\nWe have this all
