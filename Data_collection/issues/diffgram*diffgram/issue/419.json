Before actually completing the task, we need to ask in a popup dialog, who should review this task.\r\n- We can also think of ways of automating the review assignation at the task template wizard level, so annotator don't have to choose who reviews their task. In this case maybe adding support for being able to select a default reviewer or reviewers, so then the system automates the assignation of the reviewer when the task is completed. This one might require a bit of more backend support, but the first bullet I think could be fully supported once the features on https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/pull/406 are merged.\r\n\r\nWhen Already in Review:\r\n- When the reviewer completes the task that is `in_review` status. We open another popup dialog before completion, asking if the reviewer wants to approve the review (Which should complete the task). Or request changes to it. Which should set the status to `requires_changes`.
