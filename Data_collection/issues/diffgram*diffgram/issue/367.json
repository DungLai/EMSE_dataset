Dedicated screen focused on workflow managers\r\n\r\nContext is that we have various reporting options, dashboards, task views etc. But they are all a little abstract. \r\n\r\nBasically, if I'm a Annotation Manager, what do I want to see? What actions do I take most often? etc.\r\n\r\nThe building blocks for this, in reporting, task list etc are all there.\r\n\r\nThis is extension of the other ideas where we have more role focused screens that are built on top of the single abstract screens.\r\n\r\neg here, perhaps the task list would default to not show completed tasks so as to put focus on work in progress \r\nor reporting is more user centric to an annotation manager persona \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
