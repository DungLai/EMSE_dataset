(could be disabled in settings).\r\nThis would help get visibility on it and future isues.\r\n\r\nIf it's too hard to quickly implement pro-actively in the backend saving process, we already have the deleted count I believe on frontend so at least could warn that it's happening. Assumption here is it's flagged from backend, eg that it's a system error somehow. Additionally could run a check on frontend but that could miss edge case of not loading a list etc. \r\n\r\n(Edit: I removed other note as I remembered we already validate that the existing IDs are present and sent from frontend)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Potential gotchas\r\n1) We naturally soft delete instances as part of normal system operations, \r\nand in some cases eg https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/486 there may be many.
