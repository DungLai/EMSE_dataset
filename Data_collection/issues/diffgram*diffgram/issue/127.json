Click a dataset to view Data Explorer of it.\r\nUser goal of visually inspecting information (and further filtering / extraction?). Starting with the work at a certain known stage. eg As a user I want to inspect the output of QA step 2.\r\n\r\n  Ideas: \r\n  open in a full screen panel (like import wizard) \r\n  or a new tab \r\n  or go to it.\r\n\r\n  I like the idea of maintaining context, since a user may want to skim through multiple sets in one session.\r\n\r\n### 2. See file counts at each stage. \r\nThere's a LOT more we could do here, but just start maybe seeing file counts would help better visualize the work in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other ideas?\r\nIf you want something further here on the pipeline context please feel free to add to this issue or create a new issue :)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
