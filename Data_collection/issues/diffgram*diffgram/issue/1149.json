Although it works correctly, this is not the standard in terms of respecting REST standards so might make it difficult for people to understand and use the API, and for use to use automated tooling based on REST standards.\r\n\r\nThere are other similar cases of this in the system, the approach to solve it is:\r\n\r\n1. Change the request methods and parameters (if it has a body) to query params.\r\n2. Change all frontend calls to the new method, and move the call into a single function in API Services section of the code.\r\n3. Change any calls on the SDK to it.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1149/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
