The \"when\" trigger is set to `task_completed` and \"do\" points the URL to a mock endpoint on [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/). \r\n\r\nHowever, after creating a task and marking it complete, I don't see any JSON payload received at the mock endpoint. I've performed a \"hello world\" `curl` POST to the same endpoint to confirm that it is available and receiving correctly. Anything else I can do to debug, like logs associated with the workflow?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any documentation for the expected structure of the JSON payload related to each webhook event?
