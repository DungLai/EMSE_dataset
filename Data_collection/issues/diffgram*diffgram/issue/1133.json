Remove the listeners from the constructor classes of the instances\r\n2. Add functions to add callbacks on event: `instance.on('selected', callback)`\r\n3. Refactor `CanvasMouseCtx` and the `initialize_instance_object()` function to better handle callbacks and event listeners.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1133/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
