Diffgram is for everything humans already know the answer - and need it repeated automatically.\r\n\r\nWe build the bedrock tooling to help the most innovative teams and companies in the world ship state of the art production supervised systems.\r\n\r\n### Open Source Work\r\nMost of your work is [in the open!](https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram) Get satisfaction from seeing your work ship quickly and directly impact the product.\r\n\r\nThis is engaging, serious work that will leave a lasting impression on your career.\r\n\r\n### High Equity\r\nWe offer above market equity as part of the compensation package.\r\n\r\n### High Autonomy\r\nWe are product focused and engineering led. You may get directions as broad as \"build a 3D interface\" or \"make this subsystem 10x faster\". And often that direction will come directly from users, customers, and your own observations.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to directly speak with users, deliver your features end to end, and even share with the world why the feature matters.\r\n\r\nYou will have substantial freedom on design and implementation. Usually the rule of thumb is \"implementer's choice\" , meaning in any case where the benefit of multiple paths is ambiguous, the default is for the implementer to decide.\r\n\r\n### Remote First Team\r\nWe are a remote first team. Work from anywhere in the world. And from nearly any time zone.\r\n\r\nCurrently out team is in CST, PST time zones. However we have customers and users globally so we are actively looking for folks from alternative time zones!\r\n\r\n### The work\r\n\r\n- Requirement gathering and system design\r\n- Implementing complex user experiences\r\n- Discussion with stakeholders and close understanding of product vision\r\n\t\r\n### Requirements\r\n- Have a student mindset - always learning\r\n- Love challenges.\r\n- Have built and maintained a complex  product\r\n- Python, Javascript, Vue JS, Postgres, Flask, Go\r\n- Have done it all for **at least 6 years**\r\n\r\n### Learn more about our hiring process\r\nhttps://diffgram.readme.io/docs/diffgram-hiring-process\r\n\r\n### Apply here\r\nhttps://angel.co/company/diffgram/jobs/802475-full-stack-engineer","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
