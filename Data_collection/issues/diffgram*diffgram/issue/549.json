Further it is unclear that they need to complete the onboarding in order to finish this. This can lead a new user, especially on invited by someone else, to feel like the overall app is not working as expected.\r\n\r\n### Intent\r\nThe user is smoothly redirected to complete the onboard steps if they fall off the golden path\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nhttps://diffgram.com/user/builder/signup\r\n\r\nSome of the things that jump to mind \r\n1) Check current state especially around initial page\r\n2) What page if the user aborts sign up and they come back later?\r\n3) Are all the basic front end links disabled properly if the user has not completed onboarding? \r\n4) What happens if they have a direct link to a project, does it still redirect if not verified?\r\n\r\nThe main context here is that I think we haven't spent enough time in general on these \"secondary\" invites (not first user at a company but the user's invitees). And that all the various upgrades over past while there are likely some new links added that make it easier to accidently bypass that onboarding process.\r\n\r\nSimilar somewhat to\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/545\r\n(Solving that would at least make the errors more visible while clicking around)\r\n\r\nWe do already store some type of keys on store when user logs in, so in theory should be able to use that in a way here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"anthony-sarkis","id":18080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis","html_url":"https://github.com/anthony-sarkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
