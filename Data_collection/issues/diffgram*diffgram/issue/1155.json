Annotation core is our worst legacy file and so it's hard to maintain right now. We are working on this with big refactor. Eventually if it's composable enough, Task can be like a certain annotation implementation, instead of being more a \"mode\" like it is now.\r\n\r\nIn the near term, we could add maybe a few more of the existing tests that run in studio context, and copy them to Task context with small changes. Sort of like a canary in the coal mine if something is off in the task specific context.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
