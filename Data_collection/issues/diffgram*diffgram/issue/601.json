e.g. old annotations from another frame, or having it appear deleted if say annotations weren't loaded.\r\n\r\nAs we iterate on this we need some way that keeps that user promise but also is smoother on the eyes\r\n\r\n### Ideas\r\nWe could show a linear loader in a set place?\r\nThat would give a similar level of user signal, but without such a \"in the face\" flashing perhaps?\r\n\r\nA related concept was the switch to timestamp by default for video instead of loading the \"real\" frames.\r\nIf that works well, then that would bypass at least one of the reasons for the loading screen in the first place.\r\n\r\n(The other main reason, the annotations would still be there, so either way the above would probably still apply)","closed_by":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
