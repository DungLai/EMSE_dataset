It produced 3 instance versions. Apparently during a single save event\r\n2. When I edited it again, 1 of the 3 new versions moved to being restored\r\n3.  The version numbers are duplicated, and sort order of the things seems off.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/147608332-6908c265-8205-4191-8c1a-ea9cb41eb199.jpg\" width=\"400\">\r\n\r\nAs a next step I was looking at the added/deleted. \r\nThe first save cycle worked as expected. But saving it again without changing or reloading caused this unexpected deletion report:\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/147609609-97dea661-7fd7-4275-bfee-3cbae614c637.png)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected, since there were no UI based changes. \r\nThe IDs show up under the removed column. So it seems like it's somehow still trying to remove stuff a second time which is in error.\r\n\r\nSaving a third time results in no added or deleted. And editing or moving one annotation results in the expected add/deleted.\r\n\r\n## Further context & next steps\r\nThis may be part of the reports of annotations being deleted. Although at least so far I have not been able to reproduce the deletion effect reported.\r\n\r\nThe context of the usage is following one object at a time, while the other objects in frame aren't edited.\r\n\r\nGiven we want to continue improve these core aspects of the saving system,\r\nrefactoring, \r\nwriting new tests for these cases etc. \r\nis likely a better use of time then overtly tracing any specific case. It may be time to start writing out some of the more complex test cases here.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/486\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues/484\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/487/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
