Like in android settings menu.\r\n\r\ne.g. typing `new` -> prompts to go to new task, new project, new upload etc...\r\nand can map various words like `upload` `import` etc to import page.\r\n\r\nmaybe there's some open source library we can plugin for this type of thing too\r\n\r\nthis could be a precursor to a more general omni-search type function that includes top level data elements too (e.g. tasks, users etc).  \r\n\r\nLet's consider that broader direction when choosing a library to run it. Also recalling that for local deployments we want to keep major application level dependencies in mind - e.g. may or may not be right ot jump all the way to something like elastic search.
