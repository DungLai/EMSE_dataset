Make sure we are getting the colors of the instance in a centralized matter, currently instance_list component has many parts that deal with the color. We should place them all in a single place.\r\n2. Make sure we are getting the project color map in the project context, and the color map from the task/job in the task context. We should almost never use the label_file.colour as this is just a fallback mechanism.\r\n\r\nSome commits that worked in that direction: https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/pull/271/commits/4277ae1b90ad188ce1ea79195f402b5c4fdc4633\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
