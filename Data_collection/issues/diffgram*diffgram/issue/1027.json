Problem\r\n- UI selector for setting limit not yet implemented \r\n- Pagination is not fully implemented\r\n\r\n### Workaround \r\nUse search filtering, like tags or free text search box\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nWhen using tag ABC + search query ABC then limit applied\r\nusually there is some filtering done, so the 50 is more like \"top 50 result set\" then complete list\r\n\r\nThis is also only an issue when using many jobs with a small amount of work in each. A valid approach but just a little different from the big batches or pipeline contexts.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/master/default/methods/task/task_template/job_list.py#L199\r\nOn that specific page we don't happen to have a selector https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/master/frontend/src/components/task/job/job_list.vue#L676\r\n\r\nSide note, it would be good to pop the date selector filter / other common ones from the input list / task list\r\nmaybe as a follow up or if it's easy when in same part of system\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1027/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
