It would give a better idea of how much work I still have pending overall.\r\n\r\nAlso for the admin's perspective, it could give a better perspective of the workload assignation using the new reports in the task template dashboard.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n1. We still want to keep in mind that we want this process to be somehow automated as for 1000's of task we don't want to have to assign them manually in the UI.\r\n2. Maybe we can think about \"Assignation Algorithms\" for this, like assign to the user with less tasks, for example.\r\n3. We would need to also improve the assignment edition, because if the user ir not happy with the system's assignation, the user should be able to manually unassign and assign other users.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
