Due to that we have to handle different cases in _copyInstance method. When we change this, all _copyInstance method can look like:\r\n`\r\nlet newInstance = instance.get_instance_data();\r\n`\r\n`\r\nlet initializedInstance = new Instance();\r\n`\r\n`\r\ninitializedInstance.populate_from_instance_obj(newInstance);\r\n`\r\n`\r\nreturn initializedInstance;\r\n`\r\n- Second thing is that we coupling this CreateInstanceCommand and annotation_core by using ann_core_ctx and it's methods. We should move all the needed logic to utils (or something like that) and stop calling component's methods inside the class  ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
