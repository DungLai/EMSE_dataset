They have mixed concerns from the annotation context and the creation/edition context. This issue is to propose some improvements to the readability of the code after @vitalii-bulyzhyn works on it and @PJEstrada  discussions.\r\n\r\nKey parts to refactor:\r\n- Move all API calls to the `services/` folder so that they can be reused across different components.\r\n- Make the responsability of the Root component (in this case the attribute wizard) to make any API calls to the backend. The step components should only emit events to keep API endpoint centralized in the wizard component. This is because the attribute_group object is managed by the wizard component and if the child components do API calls or modifications, it can become hard to find them.\r\n- Separate logic in smaller components instead of long if statements. For example: the options creator section, should only appear for certain kinds of attributes. But this code is not wrapped in a separate component.\r\n- Separate components from annotation context and creation /edit context.\r\n- Separate the annotation attributes component into smalle components based on the kind of the attribute. For example, have a `radio_button_attribute.vue`, `tree_view.vue`, `select_attribute.vue`, etc. Instead of a single `attribute.vue` where inside we have a big if statement with all the logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
