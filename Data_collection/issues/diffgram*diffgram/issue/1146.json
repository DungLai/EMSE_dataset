And I set a domain name (example: diffgram.ai.com )to localhost:8085.\r\nThis domain name can be access on internet, it's means anyone can create user and create project.\r\n\r\nQuestion 1: Can I forbid create user function, user only access it by invite ?\r\nQuestion 2: Where can I see all the registered users and manager them( delete or something else) ?\r\nQuestion 3: On project A, I invite a user Jams. On project B, it's seems I can't add Jams to project B. I must invite Jams repeat. Is this normal ?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"feifeizuo","id":6001243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDEyNDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo","html_url":"https://github.com/feifeizuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feifeizuo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
