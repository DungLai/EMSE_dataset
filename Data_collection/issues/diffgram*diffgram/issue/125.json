the context of the process media  failing or halting, I think it can be a good idea to have a process supervisor that checks something like this \r\n\r\n```\r\nif

dies and stops processing items for whatever reason.","closed_by":{"login":"anthony-sarkis","id":18080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis","html_url":"https://github.com/anthony-sarkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/125/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
