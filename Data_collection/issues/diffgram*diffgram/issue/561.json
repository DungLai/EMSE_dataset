Once the first point is selected I can't change it until completing drawing. \r\n\r\nIn practice this makes it very hard for a new user, or a new template, to be reliably positioned the first time around.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/152601557-55a0f1c0-bdbc-4318-8292-59bfa21c0579.png)\r\n\r\n### Intent\r\nThe intent is to make it possible to reasonably place a template with the initial draw.\r\n\r\nHow to make the UI experience of that initial placement more smooth. How do I know where to position the mouse when I first start? \r\n\r\nThe test if this change is successful is if a person can annotate a new type from the original draw, and get it relatively accurate without having to \"edit\" again after. \r\n\r\n## Ideas:\r\n**Snap to a corner in draw mode.** \r\ne.g. admin draws template how they wish, but when annotator starts drawing, it's always from the most extreme edge, say the top left. Basically eating the whitespace that is there unless the user happens to position the template on the left top corner.\r\n\r\n**Move to some other mode of doing it. For example:**\r\nWhen in draw mode, before the user clicks anything there is a \"ghost\" annotation that follows the users mouse position (e.g. centered). That way they can see it before selecting it.\r\nThen through some hotkey, or perhaps when they first click it, it goes to the width/height scaling by default.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/152602657-8c8d50ec-32ec-4141-98c4-85c174226a59.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nlet's maybe revisit how other UIs are doing this too\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PJEstrada","id":6606958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6606958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada","html_url":"https://github.com/PJEstrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PJEstrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
