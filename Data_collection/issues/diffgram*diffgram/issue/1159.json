This index is the base of many interactions on all the instance types. However, in some cases we might have multiple instance being hovered (case of 2 instances on top of each other). In this cases the hovering and selection logic can be more tricky than when having an instance hovered array.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to change `instance_hover_index` into a `instance_hover_index_list` so that we can have multiple instances hovered in parallel.
