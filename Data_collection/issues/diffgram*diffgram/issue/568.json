This also further cements diffgram as the most customizable training data platform.\r\n\r\nOne implementation idea is some kind of `get_hotkey` function that first tries to get it from user settings, else from some default dictionary with the default hotkeys\r\n\r\nImplementation wise this can use the user settings store, so when a user saves it saves to local settings. And when we eventually persist that server side it will be rolled into that.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a fairly common pattern so may be some good material to search on common implementations etc. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/568/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/568/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
