Plus doing all the data validation could take some time to perform:\r\n\r\n-  If we don't download all the 500,000 files to the frontend, then we would need to do API calls to check if the files exists. This could also be possible, but it also seems like a slow approach. But at least here we would reduce the probabilities of crashing the client. We are also depending on the cloud providers API offering a way to asks if a specific list of blobs exists.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
