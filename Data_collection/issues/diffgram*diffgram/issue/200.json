Also [exams](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/exams-introduction) allows each user to annotate and then compare their work against a golden set.\r\n[More on existing Data Quality Features](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/measure-data-quality-annotations-more)\r\n\r\nHowever, we don't specifically have the following features yet:\r\n\r\n1) Generate a \"Score\" based on a \"known good\" reference set on new tasks.\r\nSurface a score in a more \"task manager level\" way. eg \"90% of the 5 known good samples were correct in the new batch\".\r\n\r\nFor example, out of a set of 100 samples, 5 were prior completed and are deemed to be \"correct\". \r\nWhen those 5 get reviewed a second time, score how closely they relate to each other.\r\nCore assumption here is the ability to declare beforehand which were correct.\r\n\r\n2) Select only a subset of the batch to be completed multiple times. Then provide a score similar to the above mentioned example. This is the case where there is no \"known good\" provided before hand.\r\n\r\n**Do you want this feature?** If so please place an emoji on this comment and add a comment describing your use case and more detail\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/200/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
