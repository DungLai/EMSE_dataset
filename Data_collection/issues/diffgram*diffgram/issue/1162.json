Something to do with how chart js loads probably. \r\n\r\n- [ ] TaskTimeTracking related reports have been integrated into Reporting directly, \r\nthis should mostly deprecate AnnotatorPerformanceReport and TimeSpentReport but they have not been removed. See next point\r\n- [ ] Extending the new InitQuery class concept to work with predefined reporting classes, sort of in the direction of the \r\nThe main idea each reporting class defines it's own class specific logic, using InitQuery and new concepts as needed.\r\nSo instead of current state of those classes having a single run() function, they could instead have things like `self.init_query.base`, `apply_filters()`, `format_results`, `define_format` etc.\r\nMore on this in other docs / see Anthony\r\n- [x] Double group by `label` has regressed\r\nMostly on the actual formatting, it just hasn't been updated to new style\r\nDONE https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/pull/1275\r\n\r\n- [ ] Exporting non-time series to CSV\r\n\r\n- [ ] Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] The by user drill down module is missing from Insights panel\r\n- [ ] The difference between the Insights (per job) reporting, and the global reporting feels ill-defined. I think the technical side here doesn't need much work, more just documenting how it flows, like that one's \"pre-filtered\" to a specific view etc\r\n- [ ] Documenting new dedicated reports. We have a variety of newish dedicated reports (like annotator performance, approve/reject etc). These are all good but just need to document them better. Each report maybe has it's own page briefly explaining the purpose behind it, what it includes/doesn't include, etc. It's one of those things that's obvious when we make it, but then time goes by. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to add other ideas on improving reporting and analytics\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/1162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
