Diffgram has currently no UI for supporting this. Adding a audio interface will allow more users to get the benefits of Diffgram's data management existing features, and data ingestion features while expanding the number of use cases where Diffgram can be a supporting tool for the training data generation.\r\n\r\nMotivation (Rationale):\r\nHelp the community of users that work in the Audio ML space by providing an integrated platform for audio annotation training along with all the other benefits in the 9 core pillars of the Diffgram platform.\r\n\r\nSpecifics\r\nSome of the core goals for this improvement\r\n\r\n- Product Research\r\n- Initial architectural decisions for frontend\r\n- Some of the backend architecture is already supported, we just need to add support for uploading main Audio files (WAV, mp3, etc)\r\n- Identify if there are requirements for any extra steps / configurations in the task template wizard or in the label editor settings.\r\n- Define the end goals, development tasks, and user stories to cover for V1 of this Audio interface.\r\n\r\n### Notes & Considerations\r\n- Main focus on frontend as most of the backend architecture will already support ingestion and annotation storage.\r\n- Reference for DIPs: https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/diffgram-improvement-proposals-dip-reference","closed_by":{"login":"anthony-sarkis","id":18080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis","html_url":"https://github.com/anthony-sarkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthony-sarkis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
