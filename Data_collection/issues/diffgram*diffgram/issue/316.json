The new get_next_task() functions and annotator homepage make this more resilient. So, As an Annotator, if for some reason the process breaks, I can restart it or resume from where they left off more easily.\r\n2. The new UI Schema allows admins to control which buttons are appropriate for their use case \r\n3. The stronger auto user assignment concepts will help further clarify who is working on what\r\n\r\n#### Next Steps\r\n\r\n**The main intent here is to build out task Status further.** \r\n\r\nSo if a task is \"complete\" that has a very well defined meaning in the system.\r\nFiguratively, the idea is moving task status from a `string` a `class`.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Better document standard Annotation and QA flows\r\n* [ ] Continue to bring more awareness to the contextual significant of task statuses. e.g. Completed task -> \"What is available to be rendered?\". \r\n* [ ] Idea of more \"Named States\". There's limits to what we can intuit. But we can at least perhaps define a set of valid actions to move to from any given state etc. \r\n\r\n#### Lets keeping bringing more contextual visibility to the UI. \r\n\r\nIf we are hiding a button or disabling a button, let's think about what that looks like in more depth. Should it be `v-if` or `disabled`? Can we add some kind of \"explain\" key to the tooltip then?  For example, maybe the `defer` button has text: \"Disabled becuase status is complete\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe default feel can be magical to the user, but if the user is confused for some reason, then let's make the explanation as non-magical as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
