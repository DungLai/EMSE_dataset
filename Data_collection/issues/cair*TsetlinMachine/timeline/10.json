@olegranmo ,\r\nno I did not pursue this problem any further, as it was related to a data science competition back then in which I tried to utilize Tsetlin Machine in and that ended not long after.\r\nI have another question though, which stemmed from another competition in which I participated very recently. The problem to solve had a very impalanced dataset (about 1:50 ratio between two classes). In retrospect I think that if I applied some form of boosting then Tsetlin Machine would perform better. Did you experiment with boosting for TM? What are your experiences with TM vs. imbalanced data in general?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/comments/724992974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WojciechMigda","id":3889167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3889167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda","html_url":"https://github.com/WojciechMigda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3981139257,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk4MTEzOTI1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/3981139257","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-10T22:00:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3981139262,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5ODExMzkyNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/3981139262","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-10T22:00:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
