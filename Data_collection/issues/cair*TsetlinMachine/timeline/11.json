Thanks for porting to node.js and your keen observation. The signs are in fact designed to be static, and instead the clause adapts to the sign. Those that have sign '+' learn the target class and those that have sign '-' learn what the other classes look like. In other words, the feedback loops modify which literals are in each clause, but not the sign of the clause.\r\n\r\nThe reason that you get different results is probably due to the randomness of the learning. Take the average of 100 executions, and \"if j % 2 == 0:\" and \"if j % 2 != 0\" should be quite similar.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/comments/568308093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2903464962,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkwMzQ2NDk2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/2903464962","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-22T22:26:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/comments/568311006","html_url":"https://github.com/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/11#issuecomment-568311006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/11","id":568311006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODMxMTAwNg==","user":{"login":"superqd","id":1652567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTI1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1652567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd","html_url":"https://github.com/superqd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superqd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-22T23:11:50Z","updated_at":"2019-12-22T23:11:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the response, that makes sense!
