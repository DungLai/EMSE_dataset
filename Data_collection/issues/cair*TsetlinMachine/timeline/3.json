The Multi-Class Tsetlin Machine, described in Section 6.1 in the paper, actually provides more flexible representation of patterns than the basic Tsetlin Machine. This is because it tracks learning of output '0' and '1' in two separate Tsetlin Automata structures  (see Figure 9), which in turn helps handling the large amount of noise in the dataset. This opens up for comparing the output of the two structures by means of the argmax operation (again see Figure 9). That being said, try setting number of clauses to 10, 's' to 3.75,  and increase the threshold 'T' to 25, and you should get similar performance as the Multi-Class Tsetlin Machine. Hope this answered your question!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/comments/392316477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1648154217,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY0ODE1NDIxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/1648154217","actor":{"login":"WojciechMigda","id":3889167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3889167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda","html_url":"https://github.com/WojciechMigda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T09:04:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1648154218,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NDgxNTQyMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/1648154218","actor":{"login":"WojciechMigda","id":3889167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3889167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda","html_url":"https://github.com/WojciechMigda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T09:04:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1648154219,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTY0ODE1NDIxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/1648154219","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T09:04:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
