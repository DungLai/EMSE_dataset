Investigating the ability of the Tsetlin Machine to handle missing data would be very interesting. We have not at this moment worked on this. One simple approach would be to ignore the missing data when calculating the output of a clause, and then skip updating the affected Tsetlin Automata. How this would affect convergence is presently unknown to us.  I definitively encourage exploring this further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/comments/392313388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1648138152,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY0ODEzODE1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/1648138152","actor":{"login":"WojciechMigda","id":3889167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3889167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda","html_url":"https://github.com/WojciechMigda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T08:05:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1648138153,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NDgxMzgxNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/1648138153","actor":{"login":"WojciechMigda","id":3889167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3889167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda","html_url":"https://github.com/WojciechMigda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WojciechMigda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T08:05:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1648138195,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTY0ODEzODE5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/events/1648138195","actor":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T08:06:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
