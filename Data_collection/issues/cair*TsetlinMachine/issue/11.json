In the feedback starting at line **260**, it would seem to imply the checks for the sign polarity would always yield the same values, which would mean the feedbacks calculated on lines **267**, **271**, **279** and **283** would always be the same.  This would seem to imply there is no reason for these feedback loops through the clauses in the first place (lines **261**, **273**).  \r\n\r\nIs that correct?  Is there a reason why these feedbacks are re-checked every time `update` is called?  They would seem never to change to me.\r\n\r\nMy worry is that could cause a subtle bug somehow, as  I'd noticed that changing the initialization of the clause signs on line **86** from `if j % 2 == 0:` to `if j % 2 != 0:` caused a drop in accuracy, which didn't seem right, as it seemed like that would still yield the same number of clauses with each sign.","closed_by":{"login":"olegranmo","id":4214416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4214416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo","html_url":"https://github.com/olegranmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegranmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cair/TsetlinMachine/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
