What if my custom dataset only has keypoints annotated?\r\n\r\n2. If i have the 18 keypoints like shown in the image below,  where can i change the keypoint definitions in this repo to match my usage?  \r\n![pose_estimation_keypoints](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79782049/183330002-bd95bdf1-41b3-4e1f-9611-67606cbfbf2d.png)\r\n\r\n3. And for Validation of the model, are other metrics available like PCK, PCP ([more info](https://github.com/cbsudux/Human-Pose-Estimation-101#evaluation-metrics))? Would i be able to use your validation metrics with just keypoints in my GTs?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @JJLimmm in https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/231#issuecomment-1207600173_","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
