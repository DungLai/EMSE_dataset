I have a few questions,\r\nI want to change the backbone to MobilenetV3.\r\nHowever, there was a problem in implementing it by referring to the training code of the repo.\r\n\r\nFirst, the loss comes out too high.\r\nSecond, after validation, both AP and AR are output at 0.000.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the pretrained model of pytorch at https://download.pytorch.org/models/mobilenet_v3_small-047dcff4.pth\r\nThen, all weights except classifier were grouped into 'state_dict' to create a new pth file.\r\n\r\nAnd I used the code of https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/11bf27e37190b320216c349e39b085fb33aefed1/torchvision/models/mobilenetv3.py.\r\n\r\nAnd I revised the code as below\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42915968/150474282-e2222987-fde1-4e86-886a-bfc33fcf5a52.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42915968/150474326-1796c871-b73c-4e84-8c78-fddc5d3c47d4.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42915968/150474347-d578ec47-f14f-4aab-bb5f-37205e638b34.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42915968/150474600-6b1ae07e-3cf6-473a-823f-9c34176ab989.png)\r\n\r\nAnd I changed the stride from 8 to 16 in the train code and the Val code.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when the learning proceeded, the following results were met.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42915968/150474919-b5c9ca6a-5619-4ebe-928d-297fc1c232d6.png)\r\n\r\nI proceeded the same as Training steps 1, 2, and 3 in readme, and detection.json was also generated normally in val code.\r\n\r\nI don't know where the problem is, but can I tell you what to check?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
