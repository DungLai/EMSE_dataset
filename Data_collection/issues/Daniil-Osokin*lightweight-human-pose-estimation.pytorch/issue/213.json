Since the experimental scenarios are much simpler, I'm currently trying to simplify the code. However, I'm a medical student and quite a newbie in pose estimation, and some parameters and details in `group_keypoints` are quite confusing.\r\n\r\n- What is `pose_entry_size`? As I understand it, it represents the number of keypoints. In my settings, I have 4 keypoints namely head, left ear, right ear, and tail base. But it seems that `pose_entry_size` should be set to 6 instead of 4 according to your code. What are the last 2 entries in `pose_entries`?\r\n- What is `points_per_limb`? I have completely no idea what that is :(\r\n- What's the purpose of `elif part_id == 17 or part_id == 18:...`? I only have 4 keypoints. How should I modify this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"tctco","id":45505657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTA1NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45505657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco","html_url":"https://github.com/tctco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
