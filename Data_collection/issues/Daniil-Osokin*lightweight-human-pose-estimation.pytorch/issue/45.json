There was no mask on other portions which may contain other people.  If this understanding is correct, how does it work on multiple persons?\r\n\r\nI am referring to this [line](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/datasets/coco.py#L36).  I could see keypoints available for only one person in the list.\r\n\r\nI am asking this because, when I ran training with the COCO dataset, I am getting zero detections.  Even when I initiate my model with weights of checkpoint_iter_370000.pth (which works well), just after 5000 iterations (batch size 16), the detections on live demo becomes zero.\r\n\r\nthanks and regards\r\nskbhat","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
