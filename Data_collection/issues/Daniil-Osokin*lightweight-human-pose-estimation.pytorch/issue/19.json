I have a question about the variable `img_scale` used on the following line: https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/1f39919c0b5cfffcb57e1a4c3c99eb16d16aad8d/demo.py#L54\r\n\r\nAccording to its use on the line: https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/a70ef04304b282f40739383fe6c4e7af245e5395/val.py#L32 I would say that the default value should be `1/255` and not `1/256` as it is a cross product to convert the color values from `0 to 255` to `0 to 1`. \r\n\r\nIs it just a confusion regarding the input size of the image or is there something I didn't understand correctly?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your answer,","closed_by":{"login":"LucasVandroux","id":1956886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTY4ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1956886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux","html_url":"https://github.com/LucasVandroux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasVandroux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
