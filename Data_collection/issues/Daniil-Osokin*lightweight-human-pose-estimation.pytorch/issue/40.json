As the dictionary already contains the whole annotation including the segmentation part which was added here https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/3fced2c8fb771a82e26246691de6a3cd9b4e05b9/scripts/prepare_train_labels.py#L104.\r\n\r\nSo, I think that we can directly access the segmentation part by using `annotation['image_id']][0]['segmentation']`.\r\n\r\nI am currently looking at COCO 2017 person keypoints json file.
