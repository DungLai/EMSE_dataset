And in demo.py, I used\r\nmodel_trt.load_state_dict(torch.load('trt.pth')) to load the model. i set the input with (1,3,192,192)\r\nIt works but did not get higher FPS. I think because of fp16. Since I tried both True and also fp16_mode = False. The result of both models is the same. Do you know what should I fix it?\r\nbest regards\r\nchenwei","closed_by":{"login":"zhangchenwei115","id":29484140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg0MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29484140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangchenwei115","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchenwei115/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
