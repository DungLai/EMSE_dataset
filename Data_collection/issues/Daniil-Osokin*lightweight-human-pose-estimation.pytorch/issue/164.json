It seems to me that you manually manage the last two `part_id` but I'm not sure.\r\nShould I leave it as it is even if the number of PAFS (and keypoints) changed or let's say my`BODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS` has length of 30 should I switch it to `elif part_id == 28 or part_id == 29:`?\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","closed_by":{"login":"JunkyByte","id":24314647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzE0NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24314647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte","html_url":"https://github.com/JunkyByte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunkyByte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
