I know you have probably answered this question a million times and I have read your responses 2x that and I am still confused about how properly set these ids. \r\n\r\nHere are my custom ids:\r\n```\r\nBODY_PARTS_KPT_IDS = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]\r\nBODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS = ([0,1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is what the PAF_IDS correspond to? for example:\r\n```\r\nBODY_PARTS_KPT_IDS = [[1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6], [6, 7], [1, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10], [1, 11],\r\n                      [11, 12], [12, 13], [1, 0], [0, 14], [14, 16], [0, 15], [15, 17], [2, 16], [5, 17]]\r\nBODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS = ([12, 13], [20, 21], [14, 15], [16, 17], [22, 23], [24, 25], [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5],\r\n                      [6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11], [28, 29], [30, 31], [34, 35], [32, 33], [36, 37], [18, 19], [26, 27])\r\n```\r\n\r\nlooking at the last element in both ID lists: what does [5, 17] have to do with [26, 27]? There are not even 27 joints? I guess my question is once I have done the first part of training: \r\n`python train.py --train-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/train2017/ --prepared-train-labels prepared_train_annotation.pkl --val-labels val_subset.json --val-images-folder <COCO_HOME>/val2017/ --checkpoint-path <path_to>/mobilenet_sgd_68.848.pth.tar --from-mobilenet`\r\nWhat do I do to get my BODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS?\r\n\r\nSorry to ask, but I am really confused about this.","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
