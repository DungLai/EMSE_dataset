Thanks for your great work! Recently, I am trying to use your network to train a detector for detecting lower limb joints (including feet). I have conducted a complete training on the cocowhlobody dataset. The effect looks good on some images, but it doesn't seem to work on some images. I wonder if there is a problem with the resolution of my network input? My training uses the default 384x384 resolution. Is there any suggestion to improve my detection accuracy?\r\n\r\n**Good example**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56378342/209669590-3ae7b0ae-5394-4b32-b50c-7e0ae026d2fb.png)\r\n\r\n**Bad example**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56378342/209669640-e58dcea4-972d-42ae-8999-e3373bd1c62b.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
