When I use the pre trained model `human-pose-estimation-0001.xml` running the command `./human_pose_estimation_demo -m <path-to-model-dir>/human-pose-estimation-0001.xml -i 0`, it works perfectly fine. But when I try with other pre-trained models, as `human-pose-estimation-0003` or `human-pose-estimation-0004`, I get the following error : \r\n\r\n```\r\n[ ERROR ] <path-to-model-dir>/human-pose-estimation-0002.xml: expected to have 2 outputs\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you know wher it may come from ?\r\nThank you for your answers and have a nice day.
