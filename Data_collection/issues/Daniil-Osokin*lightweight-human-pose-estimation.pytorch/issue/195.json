Then did you have tried that if train 3 stage directly, whats the AP different from training separately?\r\n2. what's the different between 1 and 2? It seems that 2  just load the weight from 1, and not load optimizer,scheduler,etc. Means that just training from iter 1 with trained weight? If is so, Why is it necessary?\r\n\r\nLooking forword to your reply, thx!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
