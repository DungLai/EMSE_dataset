I want implement one if not, there are some problems for me:\r\n\r\n- in terms of preprocessing, you scaled image accroding to height, and padding the lost pixels with zeros. I think it's kind of complicated, if I resize image directly to target size say (256, 456), will it work?\r\n- I managed traced the model and loaded from libtorch, but there are 4 outputs, so I toke the last 2 outputs tensor. I saw the keypoints extract and group method in python, it's very hard implement on C++, does there any snippets could help directly extract all keypoints in instance from the output tensor?\r\n\r\nHope you reply soon.","closed_by":{"login":"jinfagang","id":21303438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzAzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21303438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang","html_url":"https://github.com/jinfagang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
