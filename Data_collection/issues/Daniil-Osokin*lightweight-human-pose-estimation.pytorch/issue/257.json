Thank you for this great work!\r\n\r\nI'm currently trying to implement lightweight openpose to detect some small animals. Suppose I have a video of resolution 1080 x 720 but the animals are all quite tiny (eg. occupying a 60 x 60 space). How should I set the `net_input_size` and `base_height` to achieve better performance?","closed_by":{"login":"tctco","id":45505657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTA1NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45505657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco","html_url":"https://github.com/tctco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tctco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
