Masks are created from segmentations data. The keypoint mask and the paf mask also depend upon the masks and thus the segmentations as well .So should that be excluded from the inputs while training as well?\r\n\r\nis there only two inputs for training purpose- 1)keypoint_map and 2)paf map?","closed_by":{"login":"leftbackn3","id":38549375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ5Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38549375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3","html_url":"https://github.com/leftbackn3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leftbackn3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
