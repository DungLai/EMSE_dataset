I have a question related to the background heatmap. When you create it in [_generate_keypoint_maps ](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/2df5db059db1a043169b65b633d7bb3b8efd13a6/datasets/coco.py#L72) method, you put a value of 1 in positions without keypoints and 1 - the maximum value of all the keypoints heatmaps on each point. I have tried training without a background mask, but usually, with small heatmaps, the model converges in a zero value heatmap because usually, this is the, but I thought about it and I want to know how does it help in training.
