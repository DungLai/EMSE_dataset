If I adjust its depth to 1024（Currently 512）, Whether the number of channels still need to be set to 128? When I use mobilenetv2 or mobilenetv3？Looking forward to your reply.","closed_by":{"login":"augenstern-lwx","id":66723608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzIzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66723608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx","html_url":"https://github.com/augenstern-lwx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/augenstern-lwx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
