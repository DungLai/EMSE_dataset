I tested on RTX 2080Ti GPU and i7 9700, but it was around 15 fps, and CUDA usage was only 10%. I tested this on the python version.\r\n\r\nI'm confusing about it, why it takes lower CUDA usage but gets lower fps. I tried to disable the tracking and smoothing modules, but the CPU usage still spent 100%.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the 3D pose embed version (lightweight-human-pose-estimation-3d-demo.pytorch) also got 100% CPU usage but can exactly obtain 30 fps, which is the upper limit frames rate of my webcam's feed. By the way, I measured the FPS by the python's datetime module instead of OpenCV.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/91/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
