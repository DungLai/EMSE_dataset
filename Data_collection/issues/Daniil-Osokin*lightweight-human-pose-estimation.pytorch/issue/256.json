The information above ,I meet it when I run Step 4. I choose the weight file is checkpoint_iter_40000.pth.  So the Step 4  command line is changed to \r\npython train.py --train-images-folder ./COCO_HOME/train2017/ --prepared-train-labels prepared_train_annotation.pkl --val-labels val_subset.json --val-images-folder ./COCO_HOME./val2017/ --checkpoint-path ./default_checkpoints/checkpoint_iter_40000.pth --weights-only --num-refinement-stages 3\r\nI think that only changing the weight file isn't the cause of the problem, so I hope you can help me to solve it.
