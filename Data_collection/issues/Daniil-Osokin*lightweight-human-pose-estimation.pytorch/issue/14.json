Thank you very much for your work, it's very good. I would like to get the real-time coordinates of each joint and save them in a CSV file. Where is the place in the code I could get them ? \r\n\r\nI already checked in keypoints.py but I don't know how I could clearly identify each joint (left wrist, right wrist, left elbow, right elbow etc etc) and get it's coordinates in real-time.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your feedback, have a nice day :)  ","closed_by":{"login":"mohamdev","id":40664995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjY0OTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40664995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev","html_url":"https://github.com/mohamdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
