I noticed that the keypoints show up on wrong places in the webcam window. \r\n\r\nI suspect it has something to do with the way the keypoint coordinates are rescaled back to the original image size [here.](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/57db93e3b7254acaa0f03bb67950738ff7d7b1a6/demo.py#L102-L103)\r\n\r\nDo you have any insight on what goes wrong?
