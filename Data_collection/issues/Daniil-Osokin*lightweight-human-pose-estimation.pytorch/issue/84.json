I've that your paf-process is very fast, so I want to use it on my project. But my model only inference 15 keypoints (I add centeroid of person as  additional keypoint, remove eyes, and ears).  I change KP_IDX follows my setup. Here is my keypoints sequence : [\"nose\", \"neck\", \"right_shoulder\", \"right_elbow\", \"right_wrist\",\"left_should\", \r\n                     \"left_elbow\", \"left_wrist\", \"right_hip\", \"right_knee\", \"right_ankle\", \"left_hip\", \"left_knee\", \"left_ankle\", \"centeroid\"]\r\nSo I change in https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/modules/keypoints.py#L5-7\r\n```\r\nBODY_PARTS_KPT_IDS = np.aray([[1,3], [1,6], [1,2], [2,3], [2,6],\r\n                        [3,4], [4,5], [6,7], [7,8],[3, 15],\r\n                        [6, 15], [9, 15], [12, 15],[3, 9], [6, 12],\r\n                        [9,12], [9,10], [10,11], [12,13], [13, 14]]) - 1\r\nBODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS = ([0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11], [12, 13], [14, 15], [16, 17],\r\n                      [18, 19], [20, 21], [22, 23], [24, 25], [26, 27], [28, 29], [30, 31], [32, 33], [34, 35], [36, 37], [38, 39])\r\n```\r\nBut when I get the output keypoints.
