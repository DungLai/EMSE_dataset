I have a question about the skeletons tracked by the camera. \r\n\r\nActually I'm doing games on Unity, and I need to recognize each player that is in front of the camera, so I need to affect a skeleton (with an ID) to each player during the whole duration of a game (the game lasts between 2 and 5 minutes). But if the skeletons are refreshed at each frame I won't be able to do that because each skeleton will have a new ID for every new frame. So my questions are :   \r\n\r\nIs it possible to get each skeleton's ID ? Or, are the skeletons refreshed at each frame ? \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your feedback, I wish you a nice day :)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mohamdev","id":40664995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjY0OTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40664995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev","html_url":"https://github.com/mohamdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohamdev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
