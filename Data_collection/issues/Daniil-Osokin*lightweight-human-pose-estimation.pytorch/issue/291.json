Thanks for your great work! I want to train the network on my dataset and I have read the guide you write. But i still have some questions about the `BODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS`. \r\n\r\nAs you say, [BODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/modules/keypoints.py#L7-L8) list defines indices of network output channels which encodes connection between corresponding keypoints pair. \r\n\r\n**It is mean BODY_ PARTS_ PAF_ IDS can be set randomly as long as it is not repeated?**\r\n\r\nFor example, in your code:\r\n\r\nBODY_PARTS_KPT_IDS = [[1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6], [6, 7], [1, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10], [1, 11],\r\n                      [11, 12], [12, 13], [1, 0], [0, 14], [14, 16], [0, 15], [15, 17], [2, 16], [5, 17]]\r\nBODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS = ([12, 13], [20, 21], [14, 15], [16, 17], [22, 23], [24, 25], [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5],\r\n                      [6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11], [28, 29], [30, 31], [34, 35], [32, 33], [36, 37], [18, 19], [26, 27])\r\n\r\n**If i can change the BODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS to**:\r\nBODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS = ([0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11], [12, 13], [14, 15], [16, 17],\r\n                      [18, 19], [20, 21], [22, 23], [24, 25], [26, 27], [28, 29], [30, 31], [32, 33], [34, 35], [36, 37]).\r\n**Dose it will affect the accuracy?**\r\n\r\nIs my understanding of BODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS correct?
