Now I meet some problems in code and hope you can give me  some methods to solve it.\r\nThese days,  I am trying a new keypoints model (eg. openpose contains 18 keypoints), now I want to add some new keypoints base on it , so I hope my model can recongnize 22 keypoints in total, but based on your code, I have changed the essential information about  keypoints list (BODY_PARTS_KPT_IDS) in the code、 the code of PAF list (BODY_PARTS_PAF_IDS) and add some weight parameters about these. \r\nAbout the dataset, we use the dataset which is labeled by our team and change its type same as coco, but the code is still not to go, the wrong infomation as follow: \r\ndatasets/coco.py\", line 120, in _generate_paf_maps\r\n    keypoint_a = label['keypoints'][BODY_PARTS_KPT_IDS[paf_idx][0]]\r\nTypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not float\r\nSince this is a newly defined model about keypoints, I think I must have some mistakes in the process of modifying your code.\r\nI hope you can give me some suggestions about creating new model based on your code, so that I can quickly solve the problem and reproduce my model based on your code.\r\nThank you again! Wish you all the best in your work and happy everyday！\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
