I don't mind if it takes a long time to run.\r\n\r\nA slightly separate question - the reason why I am interested in training myself is because the pre-trained model does not seem to work well with individuals who are lying prone. (e.g. lying on a sofa). I was going to experiment with training the model with all training images rotated 90* CW and CCW to see if this helps. Can you think of a better way to do this that I might be missing?\r\n\r\nThanks very much!","closed_by":{"login":"jsynnott","id":25245311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ1MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25245311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott","html_url":"https://github.com/jsynnott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
