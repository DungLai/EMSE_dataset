work!\r\nIn your training guide, there are 3 different step:\r\n\r\n1. --from-mobilenet\r\n2. --weights-only\r\n3.  --num-refinement-stages 3\r\n\r\nthere are two question:\r\n1. from 2 to 3, i can understand it that you need to train the front refinement stage to get stable output and then to train the rest stage, is it right? Then did you have tried that if train 3 stage directly, whats the AP different from training separately?\r\n2. what's the different between 1 and 2? It seems that 2  just load the weight from 1, and not load optimizer,scheduler,etc. Means that just training from iter 1 with trained weight? If is so, Why is it necessary?\r\n\r\nLooking forword to your reply, thx!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
