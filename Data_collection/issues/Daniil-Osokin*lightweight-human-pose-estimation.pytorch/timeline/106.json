Daniil, thank you for you work, I wanted to check with you if sigmas are correct.\r\n\r\nFrom this issue https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/106 I see you got the values from the coco metrics, for `hip` the value recommended by coco seems to be `0.107 (.107 in the coco page)` while on your code is `1.07` https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/modules/pose.py#L15 is this a typo or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-17T19:47:06Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T19:47:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/259","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/259/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/259/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/259/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/259","id":1209787853,"node_id":"I_kwDOCldfCM5IG-XN","number":259,"title":"Training
