Try to overfit on a small batch of data, e.g. 2-4 images. So limit a dataset to 4 images, make a batch size 4, disable augmentations, and run the training. If loss will decrease rapidly, then everything is ok. You may also visualize predicted heatmaps alongside with input images to check what was learnt and get if training goes well. Higher loss values for stages with randomly initialized weights are ok in comparison to loss values of stages with pre-trained weights.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/1031514071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6019622253,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCldfCM5DGXzJzwAAAAFmzCVt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/6019622253","actor":{"login":"alicera","id":59388989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Mzg4OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59388989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera","html_url":"https://github.com/alicera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-07T14:14:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6019622261,"node_id":"SE_lADOCldfCM5DGXzJzwAAAAFmzCV1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/6019622261","actor":{"login":"alicera","id":59388989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Mzg4OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59388989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera","html_url":"https://github.com/alicera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alicera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-07T14:14:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/1036549877","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/238#issuecomment-1036549877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/238","id":1036549877,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCldfCM49yH71","user":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users
