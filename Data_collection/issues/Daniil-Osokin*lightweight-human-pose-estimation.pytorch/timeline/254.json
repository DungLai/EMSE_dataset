It looks like a code adaptation for the ROS should be performed, e.g. creating a ROS package. I have found [this](https://github.com/ActiveIntelligentSystemsLab/pytorch_enet_ros) example, which uses `LibTorch` to run the network in ROS. Once network can be inferred, you will need a network output post-processing code.
