I would suggest to decrease the batch size. It is ok to reduce actual batch size, but save amount of effective batch size (after which gradients are propagated). It can be done using `--batches-per-iter` parameter, so set batch size which fits to the memory (RAM) and add corresponding number of iterations before updating the gradients, i.e. to have effective batch size 80, you may pass the following arguments to the training script: `--batch-size 20 --batches-per-iter 4`. I have observed, that actual batch size of 8 elements takes ~6 GB memory when training on CPU, so adjust your number accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnd for detecting poses under different angles, you may try just to allow [more rotation augmentation](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/datasets/transformations.py#L89) during training. However if your target is lying people I suggest to use dataset where people in such poses are captured more often, like [MPII Human Pose Dataset](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#download).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/667656010/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/667704584","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/101#issuecomment-667704584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/101","id":667704584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzcwNDU4NA==","user":{"login":"jsynnott","id":25245311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ1MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25245311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott","html_url":"https://github.com/jsynnott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsynnott/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-02T17:49:33Z","updated_at":"2020-08-02T17:49:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Daniil,\r\nThank you so much for that very quick and detailed response - that has been an absolutely fantastic help.
