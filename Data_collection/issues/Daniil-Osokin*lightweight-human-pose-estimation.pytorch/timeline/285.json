Here's my request. I'm a master's student. My research is to enhance the student behavior classification accuracy in the classroom on embedded systems. The point of my research is classification. I need a lightweight skeleton extraction method. After searching, I found that Mr. Daniil's research is the most powerful. So, can I use your lightweight OpenPose research as the lightweight skeleton extraction method in my research? I will introduce Mr. Daniil's method in my research and quote Mr. Daniil's paper and github in my reference. Thank you for your kind cooperation. Have a nice day!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/1264649839/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"littleJeffrey","id":111277793,"node_id":"U_kgDOBqH24Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111277793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey","html_url":"https://github.com/littleJeffrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleJeffrey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7508750726,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCldfCM5TEcvSzwAAAAG_jnGG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/7508750726","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-03T16:01:21Z","rename":{"from":"E-mail
