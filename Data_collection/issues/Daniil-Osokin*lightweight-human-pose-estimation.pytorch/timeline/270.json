In general you may use any ordering. They are also specify the order in which body parts will be [grouped together](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/TRAIN-ON-CUSTOM-DATASET.md#how-persons-keypoints-are-grouped-into-instances). It makes sense to start from the most confident part, e.g. neck, and connect everything to it. You need to assemble somehow keypoints into persons. If you start from left shoulder-elbow part, it will allocate data for the new person. Then if you next proceed with the right  shoulder-elbow (part which is not connected directly with left elbow), it will also allocate data for the new person. You will need to merge two data arrays together into one persons after that. If you instead will start from the neck and add next parts sequentially, where the next part is connected with previous, you will not need to merge different pieces of data for the same person.
