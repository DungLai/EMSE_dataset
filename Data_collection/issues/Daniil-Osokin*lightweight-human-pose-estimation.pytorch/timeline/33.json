And I'm not sure, that libtorch c++ demo will be faster, than our c++ demo with OpenVINO. The network input size can be tweaked for better performance, e.g. set the shortest side to 192, can be done [here](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo/blob/master/demos/human_pose_estimation_demo/src/human_pose_estimator.cpp#L45), set the last parameter to 192. It may be enough for specific case. Answering the questions:\r\n1. The input video aspect ratio matters. If shapes of persons are skewed enough, the model will not work. So resize should be done to preserve aspect ratio (same scale for each axis). Looks like it should work with odd image size. The demo pads to even dimensions for processing with vectorized operations (SIMD).\r\n2. To take the last two tensors is ok, network has 2 stages, the second takes results from the first (the first two output tensors) and refines them. The c++ demo is open, you can find c++ implementation of grouping [here](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo/blob/master/demos/human_pose_estimation_demo/src/peak.cpp#L108).\r\n\r\nAnd please, contribute c++ demo with PyTorch if you will decide to do it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/500786710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/500804186","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/33#issuecomment-500804186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/33","id":500804186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDgwNDE4Ng==","user":{"login":"jinfagang","id":21303438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzAzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21303438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang","html_url":"https://github.com/jinfagang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfagang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T11:40:33Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T11:41:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Daniil-Osokin  thanks for your reply, I already migrate necessary codes from openvino into libtorch cpp demo.
