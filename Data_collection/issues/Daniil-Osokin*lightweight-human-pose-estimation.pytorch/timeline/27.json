For this particular network architecture there is no difference, it is from unfinished experiment. Nets with `ReLU` activations exposed \"dead\" neurons problem, so some percentage of neurons just never works. And the purpose of this work is to do lightweight net, yet maintain baseline accuracy. One of possible ways to reduce network complexity and save original capacity is to get rid of \"dead\" neurons with other activation function, so network can be more narrow (no \"dead\" neurons) but have same capacity (and accuracy). So here we've used `ELU` and the next thing is to reduce number of channels in these layers, but the time is left. I've taken this idea from RMNet paper: [\"Fast and Accurate Person Re-Identification with RMNet\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02465.pdf) by E. Izutov.

I am encountering an issue possibly related to this, and I was wondering if you had run into this problem before, and if so, how you went about fixing it:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a built a CNN that takes in an input image and outputs joint confidence heatmaps. In order to verify that my model works correctly, I first try to overfit **one** training batch of my training dataset. \r\nThe logic behind this is that the model (with its millions of weights) should easily be able to overfit the training sample (i.e. I first test the model on an extremely simple and trivial task to see if it works).\r\n\r\nI trained the network on this same batch for ~15,000 iterations, using the Adam optimizer and standard hyperparameters.\r\n\r\nThe issue I am encountering is this: The heatmap is surprisingly **unable** to overfit the _one training example_! (See below)\r\n\r\n![heatmapdiagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36773880/75411846-845a2500-58d5-11ea-8b4a-ce2c7baffcd6.png)\r\n\r\nIt appears that my model doesn't learn _at all_ and is outputting gibberish!\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, I tried swapping out the activation function from `ReLU` to `LeakyReLU` in light of your comment. \r\n\r\nAfter doing so, it appears that the model is at least able to (generally) guess where the joints are, but it is not confident at all in its predictions! (i.e. the activations are very sparse, instead of a dense gaussian kernel like you would expect)\r\n\r\n(And even if switching to `LeakyReLU` does help the model learn, I notice that most SOTA models for human pose estimation get excellent performance using just plain `ReLU`. So no matter what, the model should at least be able to overfit _one batch_ with vanilla `ReLU`)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have verified that my model is connected correctly, and that my input images and ground truth heatmaps are preprocessed correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny points or suggestions would be greatly

After doing some research, I believe this to actually be the source of my error. I would really appreciate it if you could help me understand what this \"_`mask`_\" is doing and what role it plays in training.\r\n\r\nSo in a heatmap, a lot of the heatmap values are zero (no joint located at that pixel). The error likely comes from my model learning that the quickest way to reduce the `MSE` is to just output all zeros. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that this \"_`mask`_\" is applied to the output heatmap of the model that determines which pixels are weighed in the loss. (Quoting from the Openpose paper: \"_**W** is a binary mask with **W(**p**)** = 0 when the annotation is missing at the pixel **p**_\")\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, here's some implementations I found on Github:\r\n\r\n**mks0601/TF-SimpleHumanPose:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalid_mask = tf.reshape(valid, [cfg.batch_size, 1, 1, cfg.num_kps])\r\nloss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(heatmap_outs - gt_heatmap) * valid_mask)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch (this repo):**\r\n\r\n```\r\nfeedback\r\ndef l2_loss(input, target, mask, batch_size):\r\n    loss = (input - target) * mask\r\n    loss = (loss * loss) / 2 / batch_size\r\n\r\n    return loss.sum()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI also noticed a \"_`crowd mask`_\" parameter when training on COCO dataset. I'm not sure if this is the same thing as the aforementioned \"_`mask`_\".\r\n\r\nFrom this repo:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor annotation in data['annotations']:\r\n    if annotation['num_keypoints'] != 0 and not annotation['iscrowd']:\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is: What is this \"_`mask`_\" parameter and how do I implement / use it?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your
