Recent papers on pose estimation uses 1e-3 learning rate as starting point. You can use it with [ReduceLROnPlateau](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau) scheduler. The general rule is to start from the biggest learning rate while network converges, then drop it properly. Usually it is a matter of experiments, but you can use 4e-5 weights decay for all layers. However, for depthwise conv layers in MobileNet v1 weight decay was equal to 0, because they already enough regularized by their number (significantly less than in standard convolutional layer).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/639076711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/641071149","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/79#issuecomment-641071149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/79","id":641071149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTA3MTE0OQ==","user":{"login":"thancaocuong","id":43930651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTMwNjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43930651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong","html_url":"https://github.com/thancaocuong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thancaocuong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T06:50:43Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T06:50:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank
