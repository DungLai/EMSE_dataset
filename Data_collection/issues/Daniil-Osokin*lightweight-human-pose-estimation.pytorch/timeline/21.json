I've read #16.And I will try that method.I have two suggestions for your situation.\r\n\r\n1.At present, I have completed the detection of a simple action through key points coordinates and then tracking the human who do it(signal tracking).But real time and accuracy are not good when using webcam.That's my problem.For you,I think you can look at multi tracking.\r\n2.I've seen an action recognition project based on openpose that mentions adding Numbers to everyone, but not unique Numbers.If you are interested, you can reproduce the project and determine if it is useful.\r\n\r\nI will send them to you. I forgot my gmail so I used 163 email in China.
