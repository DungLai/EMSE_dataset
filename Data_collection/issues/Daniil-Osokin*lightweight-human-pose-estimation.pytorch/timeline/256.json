I think the images path is ok , I'm running the program on the school server, so the data sets path should change accordingly.

I followed your instructions and counted the number of iterations when it will stopped.  The step 4 is training the train2017 set. In general，the training will be stopped after iteration 420000. But after 420,000 iterations, the program is still running. The same problem occurs when I training the validation sets. ( stop after iteration 20000) .
