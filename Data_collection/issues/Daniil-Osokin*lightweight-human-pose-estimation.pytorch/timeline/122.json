I believe it is due to network results post-processing. You can measure network inference, it should be fast. We provide[ C++ demo](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch#cpp-demo) for the best inference time. Python demo is for quick results preview, however there is ongoing #121 PR, which will speed up Python part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/745540312/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/747262697","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/122#issuecomment-747262697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/122","id":747262697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzI2MjY5Nw==","user":{"login":"hxm1150310617","id":31764565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzY0NTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31764565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617","html_url":"https://github.com/hxm1150310617","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxm1150310617/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-17T07:21:59Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T07:21:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank
