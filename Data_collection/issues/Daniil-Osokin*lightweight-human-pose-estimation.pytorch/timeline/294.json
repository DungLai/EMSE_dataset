I visualize the heatmaps, it seems that the network do not detect the root keypoints. As you guess, in my setting, the root keypoints is in the center between hips.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56378342/209792635-4d303329-fd5d-464a-b383-89b090f6fc13.png)\r\n\r\nIn my test, the detection effect of this network on such pictures is not very good. Can you give me some advice?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56378342/209794518-d3a52589-1818-4ece-81b7-b06c1bdb1dcf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, I also trained using Human3.6M data, and the test still uses the validation set of the cocowholebody. Unlike training using the cocowholebody training set, it seems that the AP trained on this dataset has always been 0. When i train on cocowholebody, the AP can reach 30%+. Is this because the Human3.6M data is relatively simple?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/1366521791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sulei1998","id":56378342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Mzc4MzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56378342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998","html_url":"https://github.com/sulei1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/1366701454","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/294#issuecomment-1366701454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/294","id":1366701454,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCldfCM5RdjWO","user":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-28T14:41:52Z","updated_at":"2022-12-28T14:41:52Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Think so.
