I find we can modify the `mincutoff` to control keypoints jitter and modify threshold parameters of `get_similarity()` and `track_poses()` to control the spped of generating new id, but i still have two questions, one is how we determine whether the keypoint coordinate is -1 , do we have the confidence score of 18 keypoints and set threshold to it ? another is the mathematical meaning of `similarity = np.exp(-distance / (2 * (area + np.spacing(1)) * Pose.vars[kpt_id]))`, could you please help me again ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/719409132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wwdok","id":43233772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjMzNzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43233772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok","html_url":"https://github.com/wwdok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwdok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/720074185","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/115#issuecomment-720074185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/115","id":720074185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDA3NDE4NQ==","user":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-01T11:32:31Z","updated_at":"2020-11-01T11:32:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Keypoints are detected as local maximums in heatmaps, so the keypoint confidence is the value at local maximum.
