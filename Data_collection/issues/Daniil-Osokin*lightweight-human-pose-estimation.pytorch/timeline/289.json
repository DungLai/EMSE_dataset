How did you noticed, that running with gpu were slower, than with cpu? In general for the first run (or on a single image), the gpu is needed to be initialized (takes some time), then weights are needed to be copied into gpu memory (also takes some time). There are no such costs for running with cpu.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/1336113303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/1336113848","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/289#issuecomment-1336113848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/289","id":1336113848,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCldfCM5Po3q4","user":{"login":"sulei1998","id":56378342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Mzc4MzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56378342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998","html_url":"https://github.com/sulei1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sulei1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-03T08:32:14Z","updated_at":"2022-12-03T08:38:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> \r\n\r\nBecause it cost 10 or more minutes to run when i use the gpu.
