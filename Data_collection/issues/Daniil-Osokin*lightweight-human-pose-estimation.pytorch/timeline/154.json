Firstly, the key points I want to set now is 20, and I want to add a waist node. I would like to ask you if I can directly use the COCO data set? However, the COCO data set only annotates 18 key points. If I want to set 20 key points, do I need to annotate the COCO data set again?\r\nSecondly,the key points can be detected if only the third step is carried out,?or the key points and connections can be detected only after the complete training steps have been carried out?\r\nLooking forward to your reply!
