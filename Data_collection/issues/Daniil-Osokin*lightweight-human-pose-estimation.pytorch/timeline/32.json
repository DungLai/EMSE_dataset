You know, that cpu executes not only network inference, but also OS and other background tasks at the same time, so there can be some delays. Better to run number experiments in a loop (e.g. 100 iterations), measure inference time at each iteration, then average it or take median. This network has determenistic inference, so the complexity (flops number) should be the same regardeless of weights choice.

Follow your instruction, I run the code in a 100 iteration loop to obtain an average inference time, below is the summary table.
