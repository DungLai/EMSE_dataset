We have developed this work, when the mainstream DL framework was [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), so we used it to reach the results from the paper. And with PyTorch implementation we have obtained ~40 AP, so your result is similar to the [shared model](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch#pre-trained-model) and up to date.

is coco validation set  which have 5647 images? \r\n2)I used the pretained model of iter 370000 on coco validation set(5647 images) and just got AP\r\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.103\r\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50      | area=   all | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.164\r\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.75      | area=   all | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.107\r\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.131\r\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.126\r\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.428\r\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50      | area=   all | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.616\r\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.75      | area=   all | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.452\r\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.296\r\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets= 20 ] = 0.605\r\nAt first, I think there are something wrong in my code.But, the pretrained model have AP 0.386 on  val\r\nsubset(randomly pick 250 images). So the val code are ok. Could you tell me why?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/664097484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MoonBunnyZZZ","id":30332524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzMyNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30332524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ","html_url":"https://github.com/MoonBunnyZZZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoonBunnyZZZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3587869150,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU4Nzg2OTE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/3587869150","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-27T03:18:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3587869151,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1ODc4NjkxNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/3587869151","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-27T03:18:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3587869153,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU4Nzg2OTE1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/3587869153","actor":{"login":"xavier-xiadia","id":26113349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTEzMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26113349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia","html_url":"https://github.com/xavier-xiadia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavier-xiadia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}
