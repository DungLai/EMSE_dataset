I am trying to use `posenet` as a 2d detector , and convert the 2d keypoints to the `open pose coco `format.`Posenet` outputs in the  `coco_format` list as mentioned above per frame `[x1,y,c1,x2,y2,c2,.... x17,y17,c17]]` . This is for single person , pose estimation. How can i use the above mentioned fucntion , as there there is no mention of `pose entries` which is used as a input argument here.
