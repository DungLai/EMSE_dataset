If you want to evaluate custom keypoints with `pycocotools`:\r\n1. Read formats of [annotation](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data) and [results](https://cocodataset.org/#format-results) as the first step.\r\n2. Then you need to prepare your annotation according this format. For you I have prepared small example of annotation and detection for a custom dataset of \"triangle\" object (however it is not a good idea to detect triangle by keypoints, because all corners looks the same, but it is ok for demonstration purposes): [keypoints_sample.zip](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/files/6832327/keypoints_sample.zip).\r\n3. After that adjust [sigmas](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools/cocoeval.py#L523) (number and value), which control maximum allowable shift of predicted keypoint from annotation, more about them in [\"1.3. Tuning OKS\"](https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-eval).\r\n4. When you have got the format and adjusted sigmas in `pycocotools` properly, run [`run_coco_eval`](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/val.py#L17) with your annotation and some sample detections to see if it works and shows output.\r\n\r\nAfter these steps you will have the feeling how to modify detected keypoints output in `val.py` for your use case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/881603364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/881806899","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/200#issuecomment-881806899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/200","id":881806899,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCldfCM40j04z","user":{"login":"renziver","id":13497174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13497174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver","html_url":"https://github.com/renziver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renziver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-17T03:06:33Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T03:06:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
