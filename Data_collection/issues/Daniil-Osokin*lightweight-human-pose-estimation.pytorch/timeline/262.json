Training will continue automatically when the pre-trained checkpoint is provided. Just remove `--weights-only` flag. Step 4 shows how to start training from the already trained model, `--weights-only` flag allows to copy network weights while forget training statistics. This gives better initial weights estimation in comparison with bare MobileNet weights. Step 5 shows how to add additional refinement stages, which makes network deeper. Both steps improve network accuracy.
