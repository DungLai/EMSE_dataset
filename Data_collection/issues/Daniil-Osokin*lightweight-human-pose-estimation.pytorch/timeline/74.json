With `-r` flag demo [prints](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo/blob/master/demos/human_pose_estimation_demo/main.cpp#L181) each pose keypoints coordinates: `x,y`, spaces separate keypoints from each other. New pose starts from new line. Keypoints have [this](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/output.md#pose-output-format-coco) order, not found keypoint has `-1,-1` coordinates. Last value in line is pose score (confidence). So you can parse this output or customize code to output it in `json`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/615468229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/615539945","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/74#issuecomment-615539945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/74","id":615539945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTUzOTk0NQ==","user":{"login":"huangjie-gren","id":55187979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTg3OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55187979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren","html_url":"https://github.com/huangjie-gren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangjie-gren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-18T02:16:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T02:16:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK,I get it.
