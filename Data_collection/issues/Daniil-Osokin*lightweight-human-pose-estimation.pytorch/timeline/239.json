The pose confidence is all keypoints confidences (value at heatmap peak) + part affinity values (max 1 for each part). So maximal pose confidence should be number of keypoints + number of parts: `18 + 19 - 2 = 35` or something like that (if heatmaps are clipped to [0, 1]). `-2` because the last two parts (`part_id = 17, 18`) [do not contribute](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/modules/keypoints.py#L124) to the confidence.
