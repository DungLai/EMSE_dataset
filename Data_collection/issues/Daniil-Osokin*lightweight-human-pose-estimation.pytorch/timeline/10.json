I want to ask two questions. Firstly, I tried to train the No.3 (--from-mobilenet)and train 285000 iters. However, I did not detect any points and lines when I ran the Demo with it. Do you know what the problem is?Is it because I didn't train for step four or five? Secondly, Can you tell me how much you lost at the end of your training? I want to know the approximate loss when we can stop training. I trained 285000 iters, my losses are as
