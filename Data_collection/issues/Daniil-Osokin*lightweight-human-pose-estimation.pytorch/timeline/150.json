The good batch should approximate training data distribution well. So bigger batch is usually better for that. Different gpus have different amounts of memory: some allow bigger batches, another smaller ones. So to emulate the effect of bigger batch with small memory gpu, you can set `batch_per_iter > 1` to accumulate gradients from multiple batches. So weights will be updated with averaged gradients from `batch_per_iter` batches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/799696858/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/799855880","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/150#issuecomment-799855880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/150","id":799855880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5OTg1NTg4MA==","user":{"login":"tangfayuan","id":67772825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzcyODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67772825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan","html_url":"https://github.com/tangfayuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangfayuan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-16T00:38:31Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T00:38:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks
