We have compared with the original model from the paper [\"Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08050.pdf). As you can see in the table 4 of paragraph 3.2 the AP is 58.4%. It will increase to 61%, if do an additional refinement for each found person with a separate model for single person pose estimation (CPM).
