You can try to run the [C++ demo with OpenVINO](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch#cpp-demo) or try to run with torch script. Also you can pass [`--height-size 192`](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/demo.py#L145) or less to the demo script for the faster
