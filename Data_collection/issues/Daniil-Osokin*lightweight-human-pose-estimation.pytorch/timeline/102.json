It would be great to know what do you mean under misidentification. Can you please attach some images to illustrate this? In general each pose has own [confidence](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/modules/pose.py#L24), so you can use poses with confidence over some threshold (e.g. > 10), or skip pose if number of detected keypoints is too low.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/669884403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/678803126","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/102#issuecomment-678803126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/102","id":678803126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODgwMzEyNg==","user":{"login":"Daniil-Osokin","id":2491976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2491976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniil-Osokin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-23T17:41:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T17:41:55Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hope,
