When you add a new dataset to the old pipeline or test new pipeline with the well-known dataset there is a great rule: try to overfit on small number of images, e.g. take 2-16 images and train on them. If everything is ok, the you should have loss about 0 and perfect results on these images. If not, then something in new dataset/pipeline needs to be fixed. Did you try something like this? In general, it should work ok, since there are similar models for foot pose estimation, so suggest to overfit (debug) on small  subset of images and check what went
