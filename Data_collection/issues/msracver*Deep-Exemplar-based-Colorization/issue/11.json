I have ran the Deep-Image-Analogy on linux sucessfully. but i met some problems when do as your advises like \r\n\r\n@TruePhone The Similarity SubNet (and Deep Image Analogy if you use it to build correspondence) is implemented in C++. It should be easy to transplant to Linux. Deep Image Analogy already has a Linux version (https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Image-Analogy/tree/linux) and our Similarity SubNet is actually built based on it. You may copy the source code from Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/similarity_subnet/windows/similarity_combo/ to msracver/Deep-Image-Analogy/tree/linux and slightly modify it on Linux.\r\n\r\nbut when i compile, it missing some files.h like windows.h . sorry, i am not familiar with c++ in windows. can u give me some advises to get similarity_combo file in linux?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
