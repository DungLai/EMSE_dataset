Otherwise, there will be segmentation fault, for both deepanalogy and similarity_net. The reason of segfault  for deepanalogy is the force_backward param in its prototxt. And the reason for similarity_net is the following code in caffe/src/caffe/net.cpp, funtion AppendParam().\r\n```  \r\n    has_params_lr_.push_back(param_spec->has_lr_mult());\r\n    has_params_decay_.push_back(param_spec->has_decay_mult());\r\n    params_lr_.push_back(param_spec->lr_mult());\r\n    params_weight_decay_.push_back(param_spec->decay_mult());\r\n```\r\nDo you know the reason?
