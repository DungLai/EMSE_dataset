It is better to rescale the testing images to make them similar to the training sizes. But it also supports other image sizes as if your GPU memory is enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/comments/1080077817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hmmlillian","id":42595731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTk1NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42595731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian","html_url":"https://github.com/hmmlillian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmmlillian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6314604992,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCL6S0s5GKFxtzwAAAAF4YTnA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/events/6314604992","actor":{"login":"SibingWu","id":49228945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI4OTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49228945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu","html_url":"https://github.com/SibingWu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-28T01:12:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6314604997,"node_id":"SE_lADOCL6S0s5GKFxtzwAAAAF4YTnF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/events/6314604997","actor":{"login":"SibingWu","id":49228945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI4OTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49228945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu","html_url":"https://github.com/SibingWu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SibingWu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-28T01:12:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
