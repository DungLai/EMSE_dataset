Can we achieve better results without retraining（infrared image to RGB image）？Examples are as follows：\r\n```\r\ncolor_net = ExampleColorNet(ic=13)\r\ncolor_net.load_state_dict(torch.load(opt.train_model, map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage))\r\nfor param in color_net.parameters():\r\n        param.requires_grad = True\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/comments/1200868573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"songyn95","id":105472236,"node_id":"U_kgDOBklg7A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105472236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95","html_url":"https://github.com/songyn95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"songyn95","id":105472236,"node_id":"U_kgDOBklg7A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105472236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95","html_url":"https://github.com/songyn95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyn95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-09T03:12:21Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T03:12:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/42","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/42/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/42/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/42/events","html_url":"https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/42","id":1332648080,"node_id":"I_kwDOCL6S0s5PbpiQ","number":42,"title":"Reduce
