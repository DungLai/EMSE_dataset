You could potentially compile your own against a newer version, but it still may not work. \r\n\r\nIt may just a need a rewrite to the new version completely, but that comes with retraining as well. \r\n\r\nCuda 8 though, that's... ancient. I don't think I even have a piece of hardware that can run that low.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization/issues/comments/921396959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"78Alpha","id":37676834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Njc2ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37676834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha","html_url":"https://github.com/78Alpha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/78Alpha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
