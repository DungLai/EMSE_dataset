You can test this by running `pip freeze` (or `conda list` if you're using Anaconda) and checking which TensorFlow has been set up. You can also check the devices in the Python shell:\r\n```python3\r\nfrom tensorflow.python.client import device_lib\r\ndevice_lib.list_local_devices()\r\n```\r\nThe above function returns all the visible devices. Please make sure that the GPUs are listed in the output.\r\n\r\nThe training on the 3-turn data takes about 2 weeks to complete using 2 GPUs.\r\n\r\nAll models presented here are language independent. As long as the data format is ok, any data can be fed to this framework.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nouhadziri/THRED/issues/comments/510172395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ehsk","id":1574406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzQ0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1574406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nouhadziri/THRED/issues/comments/510293389","html_url":"https://github.com/nouhadziri/THRED/issues/14#issuecomment-510293389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nouhadziri/THRED/issues/14","id":510293389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDI5MzM4OQ==","user":{"login":"xjywhu","id":43105182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTA1MTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43105182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu","html_url":"https://github.com/xjywhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjywhu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T01:45:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T01:45:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for replying my question.
