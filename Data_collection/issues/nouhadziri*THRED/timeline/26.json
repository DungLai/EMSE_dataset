The GPU-util was 70-80% when run with 1 GPU.  And it was 50% and 20% respectively when run with 2 GPUs.  But there is always a gpu which GPU-util is 0% all the time.  I turn on `log_device` to  get the device mapping, and I have sent you an email.  \r\n\r\n2. Moreover, I also wanna ask whether your experiment results in paper are averaged over 3 datasets(3/4/5 turn Reddit)?  Because I run all epochs but the result is different from the paper.
