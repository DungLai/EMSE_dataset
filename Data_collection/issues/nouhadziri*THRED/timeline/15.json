However, for HRED and vanilla seq2seq, you don't need topic words at all.\r\n- To be able to use your own data, just make sure the data format matches the description.\r\n- You can use the provided pre-trained LDA model ([here](https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ehsk-research/thred/pretrained_LDA_reddit.tgz)) to infer topic words for your own data as the following:\r\n```shell\r\npython thred/topic_model/lda.py --mode infer --dialogue_as_doc \r\n    --model_dir <PATH TO THE DOWNLOADED MODEL> --test_data <PATH TO YOUR DATA FILE>\r\n```\r\n- The vocabulary file will be automatically created during training, so no need to worry about it.\r\n- You are all set to training the model!
