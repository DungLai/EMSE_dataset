I was reading your paper about the THRED model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01063.pdf) and I've noticed that in the generation process you compute two different attention mechanisms: the *message attention* to generate a representation for the utterances and a *context-level* attention to generate the context vector in classical HRED model. It looks to me that in the actual implementation the message-level attention is missing:   https://github.com/nouhadziri/THRED/blob/master/models/thred/thred_model.py#L212\r\n\r\nIs there any reason for this? Did you notice better performance with just the context-level attention? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your answer!\r\n\r\nAlessandro","closed_by":{"login":"ehsk","id":1574406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzQ0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1574406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nouhadziri/THRED/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nouhadziri/THRED/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
