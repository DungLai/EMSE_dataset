I have read your great paper, but some confusion about the topic attention. \r\n\r\nIn the paper, you said: \r\n> The topic words {t1,t2,...,tn} are then linearly combined to form a fixed-length vector k. The weight values are calculated as the following: \r\n![捕获](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21177644/58144425-02233d00-7c81-11e9-9915-45e22f2b84d1.PNG)\r\n\r\nI hardly figure it out. Is it the same as normal query-key-value attention? In my opinion,  the final context-level encoder hidden state serves as a query, the word embedding of topic words serve as values. But how are the weights \\beta calculated?\r\n\r\nLook forward to your reply!
