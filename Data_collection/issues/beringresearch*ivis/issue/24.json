Nice work and excellent documentation.\r\n\r\nCould you clarify what you mean by \"margin â€“ The distance that **is enforced** between points by the triplet loss functions?\" (Emphasis added.) This sounds like, \"all distances are set to this value.\" From a quick read of your code, it sounds like this factor is added to all distances during loss calculations.\r\n\r\nAlso, your examples generally include a call to minmaxscaler. Is this required by Ivis, meaning that it makes assumptions about the scale of the distances between points, whether in the loss calculations or elsewhere?  \r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"bzip2","id":12174276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc0Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12174276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2","html_url":"https://github.com/bzip2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
