When the user subsequently uses Ivis (or anything else dependent on Tensorflow), the CPU version will be used. In order to utilize the GPU version of tensorflow, the user must uninstall `tensorflow` and reinstall `tensorflow-gpu` after installing `ivis`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n`pip install ivis`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe user most likely does not expect the installation of a package that depends on Tensorflow to install the CPU version of Tensorflow when they already have the GPU version installed.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis has been discussed in tensorflow/tensorflow#7166. One way around this problem is to remove `tensorflow` from the list of requirements in `setup.py` and include it in `extras_require` (see Edward developer @dustinvtran's [comment](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7166#issuecomment-282778917)).","closed_by":{"login":"Szubie","id":13461031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYxMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13461031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie","html_url":"https://github.com/Szubie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
