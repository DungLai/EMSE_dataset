Currently, one of the ways to provide a custom distance function is to monkeypatch the `ivis.nn.losses.get_loss_functions`. Other ways to accomplish the same are even messier from the perspectives of usage and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe nature of dimensionality reduction, especially when dealing with one-hot-encoded categorical features, sometimes requires custom ways to calculate loss. Under the hood, `ivis` has the ability to enable custom loss functions, but any such offerings need to be implemented in a clean and API-idiomatic manner.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA custom distance function requires its own triplet loss implementation. `Ivis.__init__` could support an additional keyword argument (e.g. `triplet_loss: Callable[..., ...] = ...`) for users to be able to pass their own.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it could simply be passed inside the existing `distance` kwarg, with its signature changing to `distance: Union[str, Callable[..., ...]]`.\r\n\r\nAnother way would be to make the losses dictionary built by `ivis.nn.losses.get_loss_functions` a module-level loss function registrar.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, docs and examples need to be updated on how to correctly implement a custom loss function. With all currently available distance metrics, the triplet loss implementation follows a very similar pattern, and should not be too daunting to attempt to implement.","closed_by":{"login":"Szubie","id":13461031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYxMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13461031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie","html_url":"https://github.com/Szubie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
