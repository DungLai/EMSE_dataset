Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe R package lacks documentation of an application to a real-life dataset.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPlease add a [vignette](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html) in the R package demonstrating at least an example application to a single-cell dataset. Basically, the equivalent of the scanpy workflow [here](https://bering-ivis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scanpy_singlecell.html).\r\n\r\nA convenient way to use the `pbmc3k` dataset for demonstration purposes is the Bioconductor [TENxPBMCData](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/TENxPBMCData.html) package.\r\n\r\nSuggested code:\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(TENxPBMCData)\r\ntenx_ pbmc3k <- TENxPBMCData(dataset = \"pbmc3k\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, consider using the vignette (or a separate one) to also give an introduction to the functionality of the R package.\r\nIt is not necessary to duplicate information already described in the documentation of the Python package (DRY principle); you may simply include a link to the [main page](https://bering-ivis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nA working example of an R workflow could also be included in the documentation of the Python package, although this is probably unnecessarily difficult to maintain.\r\nIdeally, that example would be run and tested for every new release of the Python and R source code.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOnce you have an R vignette written, you should also consider using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) to automatically create a GitHub website including the full package documentation.","closed_by":{"login":"idroz","id":12413294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDEzMjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12413294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz","html_url":"https://github.com/idroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
