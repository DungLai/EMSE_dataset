Is one-hot-encoding enough?\r\n\r\nIn UMAP you can use different distances for one-hot-encoded categorical features (e.g. dice, jaccard etc.) and continuous features, then you perform an \"intersection\" (see https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues/58).\r\n\r\nHow can we handle mixed type datasets in ivis? Can we just use it on a dataset with continuous features and one-hot-encoded categorical features mixed together?\r\n\r\nThank you very much","closed_by":{"login":"candalfigomoro","id":50733646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzMzNjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50733646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro","html_url":"https://github.com/candalfigomoro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candalfigomoro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
