But how about comparing to other scRNA-seq embedding methods? There are lots of methods for scRNA-seq dimension reduction, for example ZIFA [1], ZINB-Wave [2], DCA [3], scvi [4], scvis [5], scScope [6] etc. Most of them are zero-inflated matrix factorization analysis or denoising/zero-inflated auto-encoders.
