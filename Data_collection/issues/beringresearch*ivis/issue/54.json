The problem is that the `Ivis` class creates a file, `annoy.index`, without checking whether it first exists.  This file is overwritten without giving any warning/error presumably causing issues for the previously existing program.\r\n\r\n~~I see that this can be remedied by setting `annoy_index_path`; however, I this limitation is not obvious from the documentation and is likely to cause confusion.~~\r\nActually it appears this cannot be done.  This argument tells the program to load from this file, so there is no option to actually change the name of the index file ...\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nAlso, the `annoy.index` file is still created even if I set `build_index_on_disk=False`\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ForrestCKoch","id":13082844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDgyODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13082844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch","html_url":"https://github.com/ForrestCKoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForrestCKoch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
