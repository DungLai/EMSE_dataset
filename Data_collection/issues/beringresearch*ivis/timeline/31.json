PCA or MDS are better suited to this task. `ivis` embeddings become stable with addition of more observations and increasing variance in the dataset. For example, see Supplementary Figure S2 of our recently-published paper on 'ivis' (https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-019-45301-0/MediaObjects/41598_2019_45301_MOESM1_ESM.pdf).\r\n\r\nHere's a quick visualisation of 10 `ivis` runs on a dataset with 5000 observations, which produces stable embeddings. Note that due to the stochastic properties I mentioned earlier, there will always be some rotation, but `ivis` will attempt to preserve inter-observation distances.\r\n<img width=\"962\" alt=\"Ivis-embeddings\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12413294/62012323-d8a0f900-b17c-11e9-98a7-94326b0265f5.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/comments/515791800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"idroz","id":12413294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDEzMjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12413294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz","html_url":"https://github.com/idroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2514900877,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1MTQ5MDA4Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/events/2514900877","actor":{"login":"idroz","id":12413294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDEzMjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12413294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz","html_url":"https://github.com/idroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-28T20:20:48Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"f9b6b8"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/comments/515792858","html_url":"https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/issues/31#issuecomment-515792858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/31","id":515792858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTc5Mjg1OA==","user":{"login":"abdalimran","id":5567760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Njc3NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5567760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran","html_url":"https://github.com/abdalimran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdalimran/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-28T20:30:53Z","updated_at":"2019-07-28T20:30:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Understood.
