This is likely because categorical data is naturally represented as integers.\r\n\r\nWhen the data is purely numerical and evenly distributed, 0-1 and standardisation produce relatively similar results. We noticed that if the data has outliers, standardisation seem to work better as it's easier to compute distances between observations.
