for further improving the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file:\r\n\r\n> If your PR introduces a change in functionality, make sure you start by writing a design doc.\r\n\r\nI suggest providing a template, or at least a minimal description of what you expect as a \"design doc\".\r\nWithout providing a template, you create extra burden on the contributor (guessing) and yourself (explaining) or you could simply scare off prospective contributors.\r\n\r\n> Make sure any code you touch still has up-to-date docstrings and documentation.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: \"any code you _edit_\" \r\n\r\n> Write tests.\r\n\r\nI suggest inviting contributors to look at https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/tree/master/tests to learn and
