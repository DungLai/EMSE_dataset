However, for the `encoder_`, `model_`, `neighbour_matrix_`, and `supervised_model_` attributes, the following procedure would be adopted: `.save()` would be called for each of them, generating a `annoy.index` file for `neighbour_matrix_` and `.h5` files for the rest. Then, using the built-in `base64` module, these files would be encoded into a Base64 string, which would be attributed to the respective parameters.\r\n- In `Ivis.__setstate__()`, the same four parameters described above would be checked. If present, `base64` would be used to decode them into the binary files they originally were. Then, they would be used to load the original parameters back into their respective attributes.\r\n\r\nHowever, I stumbled in a problem: when calling `Ivis.neighbour_matrix_.save(<path>)`, or even `Ivis.neighbour_matrix_.index.save(<path>)`, no file was produced, regardless of path type (absolute or relative) or file name.

The issue\r\n\r\nSee #101.\r\n\r\n# The proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis pull request refactors `Ivis.__getstate__()` into `Ivis.__getstate_old__()` and creates new `Ivis.__getstate__()` and `Ivis.__setstate__()` methods. They work similarly to what is seen in `Ivis.save_model()` and `Ivis.load_model()` in terms of the information that is saved; however, they differ in how they do it. The new methods encode the generated files into `base85` strings and save said strings within the object—in other words, the generated files are effectively saved within the object.\r\n\r\nThis approach comes with the following advantages:\r\n\r\n- It makes `Ivis` picklable, thus enabling the storage of a produced model under a single file written in a well-known format within the Python community.\r\n- It closes #101 and increases compatibility with the `scikit-learn` module, particularly with `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` and `sklearn.base.clone()`, which is used within `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` and `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`.\r\n\r\nThe only caveat is the same one seen when using the existing `Ivis.save_model()` and `Ivis.load_model()`: whenever a `tensorflow`/`keras` model is saved by using the `.save()` method, the following warning is issued:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING:tensorflow:Compiled the loaded model, but the compiled metrics have yet to be built. `model.compile_metrics` will be empty until you train or evaluate the model.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis warning is issued two times per save/load call (when `Ivis.model_.layers[3]` and `Ivis.supervised_model_` are saved/loaded), which means in circumstances wherein these commands are frequently used result this message being spammed throughout the execution, as demonstrated below.\r\n\r\n# Minimal reproducible examples\r\n\r\nThe environment used in these examples is the same described in #101.\r\n\r\n## Example with `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`\r\n\r\nThe same code seen in #101 is executed. The execution is successful, but the log is polluted by compilation warnings related with the aforementioned issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFitting 10 folds for each of 2 candidates, totalling 20

In case there is no attachment to the existing implementation, one possibility worth contemplating is to deprecate the methodology applied in `Ivis.load_model()` and `Ivis.save_model()` and make these methods produce pickle files instead. Another alternative would be to deprecate these methods entirely and merely inform the user that `Ivis` can be pickled. On the other hand, if maintaining both implementations is justified, this paragraph can be disregarded.\r\n\r\nRegarding the warnings: do you know how we could mitigate them? I guess `tensorflow` is instructing the user to use the `.compile()` method; however, since I am not familiar with `tensorflow`, I found it better to leave this up to you. I did try to silence this warning following a couple of different alternatives within `tensorflow`; however, this warning was unaffected.\r\n\r\nSome small observations are worth making as well. The proposed `Ivis.__getstate__()` and `Ivis.__setstate__()` methods have some conditionals imposed to meet the expectations of `sklearn.base.clone()`, which is used in `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`. Additionally, no structural changes were made in `ivis/data/neighbour_retrieval/knn.py`. This file was just formatted by PyCharm to adhere to some PEP spacing conventions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/106/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5424364282,"node_id":"CE_lADOCJ2sz843fABfzwAAAAFDUTr6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/events/5424364282","actor":{"login":"Szubie","id":13461031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYxMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13461031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie","html_url":"https://github.com/Szubie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Szubie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-06T21:31:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"imatheussm","id":4311541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTE1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4311541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm","html_url":"https://github.com/imatheussm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatheussm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-04T02:56:39Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T02:56:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/109","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/109/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/109/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/109/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/issues/109","id":1044312374,"node_id":"I_kwDOCJ2sz84-PvE2","number":109,"title":"`KeyError`

The issue\r\n\r\nWhenever using `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearch` with a `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` containing `ivis.Ivis` and `GridSearch` is set with `n_jobs != -1` (e.g., `n_jobs = 2`), errors happen.

Since the logic for pickling and unpickling `Ivis` instances was improved, my belief is that this particular use case was not covered neither by the new implementation, nor by the newly added test cases. I reserved some time today to investigate this further, but so far, I was out of luck. Do you have any thoughts on this? Perhaps we could also create additional tests covering scenarios wherein `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` are used. Does this make sense?\r\n\r\nThank you beforehand for your support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
