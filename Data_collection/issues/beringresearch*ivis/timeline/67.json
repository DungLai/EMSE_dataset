The idea of weighting the sampling of triplets did occur to me back when I was initially writing ivis, but I was thinking about weighting the selection of positive examples rather than negatives at that time, as it would be almost free. Weighting the selection of neighbors never made it past initial prototyping though, since it didn't have a positive impact.\r\n\r\nFrom that paper you linked it does sound like weighting the sampling of negative examples may well the worth trying though. Hopefully the performance impact is negligible, since Annoy is pretty efficient, but will keep an eye on it. It would be nice to keep the number of hyperparameters low, but if there are clear benefits from weighted sampling it shouldn't be a problem to expand the number slightly.
