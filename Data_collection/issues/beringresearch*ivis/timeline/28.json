It does sound like a path issue. I haven't worked much with RStudio recently, but it may be that RStudio doesn't inherit system $PATH: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31121645/rstudio-shows-a-different-path-variable\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that a potential solution would be to get rid of Conda manager altogether and simply install R wrapper through virtualenv + pip. I'll test this out over the next few days and revert here.\r\n\r\nThanks

PR started out to enabled publishing of test coverage reports to codecov. Along the way it broadened:\r\n\r\n- Add codecov configuration:\r\n  - Install `codecov` instead of `coveralls` as a Py dependency.\r\n  - Tweak setup.cfg, ci/coveragerc, ci/codecov.yml so that coverage is always computed, certain files are ignored.\r\n  - Adjust Travis & Appveyor CI to upload coverage reports.\r\n  - Add the coverage badge to README.md.\r\n- Added workaround for a reticulate bug (see below).\r\n- Rename `pytest.mark.testr` to `pytest.mark.rixmp`.\r\n- Add lots of documentation and revise comments in Travis and Appveyor CI scripts so they are more directly parallel to one another. This reflects a lot of trial and error (see commits below) to debug the Appveyor/Windows/PowerShell/R/reticulate/Python/ixmp chain.\r\n\r\nNo user-facing changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iiasa/ixmp/issues/192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iiasa/ixmp/issues/192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"khaeru","id":1634164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru","html_url":"https://github.com/khaeru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T08:24:57Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T08:24:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rstudio/reticulate/issues/571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rstudio/reticulate","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rstudio/reticulate/issues/571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rstudio/reticulate/issues/571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rstudio/reticulate/issues/571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/571","id":476599654,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzY1OTk2NTQ=","number":571,"title":"Path
