This triplet constraint is said to be satisfied if the anchor point is closer to the positive point than to the negative point by a margin _m_.\r\n\r\nIn practice, we find that tuning ``margin`` doesn't have much effect on ivis embeddings. For example, check out [Supplementary Figure S4](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-019-45301-0/MediaObjects/41598_2019_45301_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) in the paper. We see that increasing ``margin`` to very high values (> 100) seems to produce exploding gradients. Therefore our recommendation is to stick to default settings. The only reason we haven't abstracted ``margin`` from the Ivis object constructor at this stage is because we'd still like to explore its effects on other data types e.g. word vectors.\r\n\r\n## Scaling\r\n\r\nivis uses K-NN retrieval to build up a set of positive and negative triplets. This technique relies on approximating distances between points. If some features have very large values compared to others, they will dominate the triple retrieval, therefore we recommend scaling.\r\n\r\nIn most real-world cases, ``MinMaxScaler`` will be absolutely fine. Note that for really skewed data, log-transformation may be necessary prior to scaling. We're also looking into the effects of ``StandardScaler`` on embeddings, but so far ``MinMaxScaler`` produces \"prettier\" results! Once we collect enough data, we will update the docs with appropriate recommendations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/comments/508656501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"idroz","id":12413294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDEzMjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12413294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz","html_url":"https://github.com/idroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idroz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/comments/508814357","html_url":"https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/issues/24#issuecomment-508814357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/24","id":508814357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODgxNDM1Nw==","user":{"login":"bzip2","id":12174276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc0Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12174276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2","html_url":"https://github.com/bzip2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T16:50:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T16:50:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the detailed answer, and for pointing me to the supplement.
