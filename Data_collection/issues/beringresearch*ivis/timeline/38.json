vignette\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nI could run the R vignette manually, but that required following it on your [repository](https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/blob/master/R-package/vignettes/ivis_singlecell.Rmd#L19), and manually running the chunk of bash code to download the raw data from 10X (https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/blob/master/R-package/vignettes/ivis_singlecell.Rmd#L19).\r\n\r\nOne of the main advantages of an R vignette is that it is generally compiled and installed with the R package itself (i.e., `browseVignettes(\"ivis\")` should display the vignettes available).\r\nThis allows users to preview the package functionality before installing it, but also demonstrates that the package simply works.\r\n\r\nTo do so, as long as the R package is distributed directly from GitHub, I suggest that you update the installation command to the following, in order to build the vignette on the users' machine.\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"beringresearch/ivis/R-package\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, the command above currently crashes because the vignette includes a chunk of code that needs to be run manually to  download the demonstration dataset (https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/blob/master/R-package/vignettes/ivis_singlecell.Rmd#L19)\r\n\r\nI will shortly open a PR to demonstrate the use of `TENxPBMCData` (mentioned above).\r\n\r\nHaving tested it locally, I must point out that installing the R package with `build_vignettes = TRUE` mentioned above will take longer to run, as it basically needs to run the method on the PBMC 3k dataset.\r\nI haven't timed it precisely, but the overall process took a few minutes on my laptop.\r\n\r\nThe result is pretty satisfying: https://kevinrue.github.io/teaching/ivis/\r\n\r\n# pkgdown\r\n\r\nI suggested `pkgdown` only because it automatically compiles and serves the R man pages and vignettes for free every time the R package is updated.\r\nThat said, you probably want to recompile the doc whenever any one of the Python or R package is updated, so I agree that readthedocs is more appropriate as the central documentation for this project.\r\nIf you can also compile and serve the R vignette there, I've got nothing to add.\r\nThat said, readthedocs is probably the best solution to update the documentation in one go when you are ready.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/comments/516622662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kevinrue","id":5769108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjkxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5769108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinrue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"kevinrue","id":5769108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjkxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5769108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinrue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T22:46:49Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T22:46:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/42","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/42/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/42/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beringresearch/ivis/issues/42/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beringresearch/ivis/pull/42","id":474856004,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzAyNzI0NTEx","number":42,"title":"Help
