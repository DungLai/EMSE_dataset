As part of my job at University of Mons (UMONS - Belgium), I will need to use your pretrained model and modify some of your scripts. The later goal is to create a deep learning live demo for general public and hopfully raise awareness for new technologies - No comercial use.\r\nDo you plan to [add a licence](https://choosealicense.com/) to this project? If not, do you let me use and modify your code  - with citation of your work?\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nPS:As this is quite urgent, could you answser before october 18th please?","closed_by":{"login":"Zarfab","id":4004715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4004715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab","html_url":"https://github.com/Zarfab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zarfab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huochaitiantang/pytorch-deep-image-matting/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huochaitiantang/pytorch-deep-image-matting/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
