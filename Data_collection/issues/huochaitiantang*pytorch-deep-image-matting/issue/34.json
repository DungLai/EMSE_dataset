Not just the human cutout. The segmentation SDKs I tried are only extracting humans (the chair gets vanished), that too with a very low quality mask (hair gets cut, parts of ear gets cut, etc).\r\n\r\n2) Mask quality should be Super-Accurate\r\n\r\nI want even the finer details like the hair, delicate clothes, etc to be extracted perfectly.\r\n\r\n3) Fast & Lightweight (for mobile phone)\r\n\r\nI want to use this technology on mobile phones (in an Android app) which should ideally work even in an offline environment. If this option is difficult to achieve, then plan B would be install the technoloy on our server.\r\n\r\n4) Technology\r\n\r\nWhat technology should I be exploring to achieve this? Is it called image segmentation or the better term would be image matting? (e.g. http://alphamatting.com/eval_25.php)\r\n\r\nI have been reading a lot and I am currently lost in the sea of various technologies out there (OpenCV, Deep Matting, Mask RCNN, Instance Segmentation, Detectron2, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc). I wonder what magic is happening behind the curtains of www.remove.bg\r\n\r\nWould your library help me to achieve what I am looking for? Any help you could provide or a nudge in the right direction would be awesome.\r\n\r\nThanks a ton!","closed_by":{"login":"InternetMaster1","id":16253584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjUzNTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16253584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1","html_url":"https://github.com/InternetMaster1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InternetMaster1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huochaitiantang/pytorch-deep-image-matting/issues/34/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huochaitiantang/pytorch-deep-image-matting/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
