The model learns within a single batch to only predict `0`s. For me, the issue was that I had not added erosion to the matting stage. The result is that the \"ground truth\" for the model mostly contains `0`s (>90%), causing it to predict `0`s everywhere. I fixed it by also adding erosion, the same amount as dilation. This \"balances\" the labels to contain both `1`s and `0`s, punishing a model that only predicts `0`s (the explanation here is a bit rubbish, happy to elaborate more if you want me to).\r\n\r\nI saw [here](https://github.com/huochaitiantang/pytorch-deep-image-matting/blob/master/core/data.py#L12) that you're only dilating, not eroding. Just wanted to suggest you check it out, maybe you're running into the same problem I had. Adding erosion might enable the usage of a sigmoid.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the inspiration!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huochaitiantang/pytorch-deep-image-matting/issues/14/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huochaitiantang/pytorch-deep-image-matting/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
