I tried to resume training from the pre-trained model (epoch 12, stage 0) by incorporating the latest changes you made. However, the loss does not seem to improve. Would you share with us the hyperparameters you used during training? Do you plan to release the new pre-trained models which incorporated the latest changes (erosion, etc.)? Thanks!
