But there still some code maybe typos or something: \r\n1. the alpha prediction loss function: alpha_loss = torch.sqrt((pred_alpha - alpha)**2 + 1e-12), as alpha = alpha/255, but pred_alpha did not divided by 255.   \r\n2. (alpha_loss * t_wi).sum() / (unknown_region_size + 1.), was it meant to be (unknown_region_size +
