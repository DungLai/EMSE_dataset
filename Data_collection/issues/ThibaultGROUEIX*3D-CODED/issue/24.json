Questions are as follows,\r\n1. I want to compute conrrespondence use templates (Elementary Structure) after trained the AtlasNetV2 ,but I don't know where is the \"Elementary Structure\". \r\n2. Now I get two files (network.pth and opt.pickle) ，and I have no idea how to get the \"FinalReconstruction.ply\".\r\n3. In this paper, your evaluation conrrespondence results use reconstruction loss, but I want to know whether I can use geodetic error to access evaluation conrrespondence results, so I can unify with the functional map method.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cainiaoshidai","id":49551022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTUxMDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49551022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai","html_url":"https://github.com/cainiaoshidai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
