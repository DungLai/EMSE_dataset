After running the `python inference/correspondences.py --dir_name learning_elementary_structure_trained_models/1patch_deformation` using the provided trained model and the example meshes, I got a folder named `results` which contains two files: `correspondences.ply` and `correspondences.txt`. I was expecting to get pairs of points {(q_r, q_t)}, however we just get a list of point coordinates (in total 177638 points). I am not sure how to interpret these results and how to get the colored meshes as in the readme file.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kuzand","id":15230238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjMwMjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15230238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand","html_url":"https://github.com/kuzand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
