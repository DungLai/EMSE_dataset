Generated shapes are scaled down too much, as in this image:\r\n![3dcoded_train_sup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830589/60615867-70a30100-9dd0-11e9-87c0-ca1c3a044659.png)\r\n\r\nI modified the data generation process to use trimesh for loading/saving. To me, the generated scans look similar to the template in orientation and scale (see image above).\r\nHowever, I only generated half of the suggested dataset size (115000 meshes instead of 230000). Would this be an issue?\r\n\r\nAny other hint?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ThibaultGROUEIX","id":11445067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ1MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11445067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX","html_url":"https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
