However, I found that whenever it turns to eval mode, the mode predicts `[2, -2, 2]`. And when it stays in train mode, prediction works fine. Did you run into this problem before? Thanks!\r\n\r\nI am using default batch size 32 because it seems only layer that will be affected by `eval` is `BatchNorm` which is related to batch size.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sonnyhu","id":4804594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ1OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4804594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu","html_url":"https://github.com/sonnyhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonnyhu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
