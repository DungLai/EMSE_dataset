From what I can gather,there is an issue with authorization. The test data is downloaded, whilst the train data gets an \"403: Forbidden\" error. I attached a screenshot of the error. Maybe you have some knowledge as to why this is happening.\r\n\r\n![Downloading the data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32020857/132869599-c1f774ed-db85-4100-94d2-5290ffd5e5b8.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, can I ask you why did you save the data in a .pth format?  This way, the data needs to be loaded all at once, which can be infeasible for some.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your response.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DavidBoja","id":32020857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDIwODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32020857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidBoja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBoja/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
