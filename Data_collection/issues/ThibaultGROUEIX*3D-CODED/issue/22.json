According to the readme:\r\n\"Sometimes the reconstruction is flipped, which break the correspondences. In the easiest case where you meshes are registered in the same orientation, you can just fix this angle in reconstruct.py line 86, to avoid the flipping problem. Also note from this line that the angle search only looks in [-90°,+90°].\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that there is no `reconstruct.py` in this master repo. I wonder how to solve the filpped reconstruction problem.
