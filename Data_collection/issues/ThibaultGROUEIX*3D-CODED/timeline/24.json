You can find the trained models for AtlasNetV2 on FAUST here (same link as in 3D-CODED readme) : \r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZAjOuTaeDrKJbFffzLnLn_K-C86fYCXs/view\r\n\r\n2.

But now I meet some questions I will show you in follow.\r\nFirst, in the paper of [Learning Elementary Structure](https://github.com/TheoDEPRELLE/AtlasNetV2), the elementary structure is obtained through ShapeNet dataset . And the reconstructed shapes are obtained through deformation of the elementary structure. You mentioned use  the elementary structure to instead of the template which mentioned in 3D-CODED. But in your code you did not use elementary structure, so I want to know if I can use elementary structure.\r\n\r\nSecond, if I can use elementary structure, I want to konw how to use elementary structure to test the `network.pth` use [inference/correspondences.py](https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/blob/master/inference/correspondences.py).  \r\nLooking forward for your reply. \r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/comments/673349656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cainiaoshidai","id":49551022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTUxMDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49551022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai","html_url":"https://github.com/cainiaoshidai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/comments/674413855","html_url":"https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/24#issuecomment-674413855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/24","id":674413855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDQxMzg1NQ==","user":{"login":"ThibaultGROUEIX","id":11445067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ1MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11445067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX","html_url":"https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-15T15:42:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-15T15:42:18Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Q1. `But in your code you did not use elementary structure, so I want to know if I can use elementary structure.` : I am not sure I understand what you mean.

In the later case, you can use either `--point_translation 1` or `--patch_deformation 1` or both.\r\n\r\nQ2. Once learned, [templates+trained network] are used in the same way to compute correspondences (discussed in past messages).\r\n\r\nBest,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/comments/674413855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ThibaultGROUEIX","id":11445067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ1MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11445067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX","html_url":"https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThibaultGROUEIX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/comments/674604529","html_url":"https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/24#issuecomment-674604529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThibaultGROUEIX/3D-CODED/issues/24","id":674604529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDYwNDUyOQ==","user":{"login":"cainiaoshidai","id":49551022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTUxMDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49551022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai","html_url":"https://github.com/cainiaoshidai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainiaoshidai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-17T00:54:38Z","updated_at":"2020-08-17T00:54:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\nThanks  professor,\r\nI am glad to get your help!
