This allows drop-in replacement between vanilla CE and focal loss. In your case, your target tensor should be squeezed along dim=1 into shape [5, 256,256].\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BloodAxe/pytorch-toolbelt/issues/comments/737064654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BloodAxe","id":532320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe","html_url":"https://github.com/BloodAxe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4060969155,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDA2MDk2OTE1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BloodAxe/pytorch-toolbelt/issues/events/4060969155","actor":{"login":"BloodAxe","id":532320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe","html_url":"https://github.com/BloodAxe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BloodAxe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-02T08:06:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
