If possible, I would recommend installing TF 1.8 and Keras 2.2 in a separate environment and first trying to reproduce the results using that. `learn_labelembeddings.py` implements another method that we used as baseline, so running `learn_image_embeddings.py` is enough. Could you specify the entire command including the arguments you are using? To be on the safe side, it would also be helpful to know how you ran `compute_class_embeddings.pyÂ´.\r\n\r\nFor retrieval, we compute the embeddings using the trained networks for all dataset images and the query image. Since the embeddings are L2-normalized, the cosine similarity can be computed by a simple and efficient dot-product operation. Dataset images are then ranked by decreasing dot-product similarity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/comments/748926572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4639811935,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDYzOTgxMTkzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/events/4639811935","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-24T10:35:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
