This integration is built and maintained by GitHub.\r\n\r\nYou can subscribe to get notifications for pull requests and issues for an Organization or Repository's activity using `@github subscribe <organization>/<repository>` command. \r\n<p align=\"left\"><img width=\"500\" alt=\"Subscribe\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integrations/microsoft-teams/master/images/Subscribe.PNG\"></p>\r\n\r\nYou can unsubscribe to notifications from a repository, use `@github unsubscribe <organization>/<repository>`\r\nYou can customize your notifications by subscribing to specific features. You can configure them using following commands:\r\n`@github subscribe owner/repo [feature]`\r\n`@github unsubscribe owner/repo [feature]`\r\n\r\nNotifications for any PR and Issue are grouped under a parent card as replies. The parent card always shows the latest status of the PR/Issue along with other meta-data like title, description, assignees, reviewers, labels and checks. Threading gives context and helps improve collaboration in the channel. Any new event that happens on a pull request or issue (like comment/review/close/merge) is added as a reply to the parent card. \r\n<p align=\"left\"><img width=\"500\" alt=\"Conversation\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integrations/microsoft-teams/master/images/Conversation.PNG\"></p>\r\n\r\nTeams conversations often lead to decisions and actionable takeaways. You can perform following actions on GitHub directly from Microsoft Teams:\r\n- Create issue\r\n- Close and ReOpen issue\r\n- Comment on issue and pull request\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><img width=\"500\" alt=\"Issue Card\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integrations/microsoft-teams/master/images/IssueCard.PNG\"></p>\r\n\r\nWhen you share links to GitHub activities and properties in the channel, more details are automatically extracted and shown as preview in Microsoft Teams channel.
