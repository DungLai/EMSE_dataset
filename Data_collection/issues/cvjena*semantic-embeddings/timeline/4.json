This decreased the mAHP@250 of all methods by between 0.001 and 0.002. The ranking of the methods was hence not affected by these minor adjustments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/comments/721941750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3959236765,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk1OTIzNjc2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/events/3959236765","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-04T19:54:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
