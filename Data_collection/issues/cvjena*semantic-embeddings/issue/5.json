We found your Github repo and paper during our research, and thought that hierarchical image embeddings might give better results for fetching similar images, as compared to a network that is pre-trained only on ImageNet (without hierarchical learning). \r\n\r\nWe tried working with the pre-trained models provided by you, but due to compatibility issues with TF 2.x, we are unable to use them as is. We are currently working on upgrading a part of this repo, to suit our needs.\r\n\r\nWe would like to train ResNet50 on ImageNet, to have approximately the same accuracy as your pre-trained models. So, we had a couple of questions.\r\n\r\n1. As per the readme, we first need to execute compute_class_embeddings.py and then learn_image_embeddings.py. After doing this, and training for 80 epochs, the accuracy is still not up to our needs. Is the execution of learn_labelembeddings.py required for better accuracy ?  Is there something that we are missing ?\r\n2. Once the network is trained well, our plan is to generate embeddings for each image from training set, and using it to create an index for efficient similarity search for top-k images, given any 1 input image. With this technique we are currently not receiving images from the same class as the input image, in the top-10 results. What technique was used to receive the results that are shown in the first image in the readme file ?","closed_by":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
