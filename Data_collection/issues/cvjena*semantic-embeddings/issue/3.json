But i am wondering about few things.\r\na) You dont insert any embedding layer rather last layer (output classes) is a embedding layer.\r\n   Why so ? Will it still work if number of classes are few.\r\n\r\nb) If embedding is one hot (no prior), how to make inference from the trained model ?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cvjena/semantic-embeddings/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
