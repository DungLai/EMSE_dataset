Hope you are all doing well.\r\n\r\nCould you help me, please, with the questions below?\r\n\r\n- How are values scored to set alerts?\r\n- Is it possible to control metrics only for the current time of day? For example, Iâ€™d like to monitor and send alerts only if an anomaly happens at night.\r\n- Are there the best practices for preparing and training models in LoudML? For example, how to take seasonality into account?\r\n\r\nBy the way, is there anyone who uses TICK-L stack in VoIP? In what cases is it possible to apply the stack except alerting?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
