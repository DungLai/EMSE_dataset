However, it is unclear to me how this loss function is calculated. I only saw 1 post shortly discussing the MSE (Mean Square Error) but can anyone confirm this is the one that is used? If not, can anyone tell how it is calculated? Maybe via the MAPE?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nThom","closed_by":{"login":"Xavear","id":10222810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjIyODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10222810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear","html_url":"https://github.com/Xavear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
