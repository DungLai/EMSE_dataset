Using cross-validation, there are high chances that we can detect over-fitting with ease.\r\n\r\nThe fastest method to evaluate a model is to split the data set into training and testing set, train the model using the training set data and check its performance with the testing set.\r\n\r\nThis split is 2/3, and 1/3 in `donut.py`and can be improved by using optional K-Fold cross-validation.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/96/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/96/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
