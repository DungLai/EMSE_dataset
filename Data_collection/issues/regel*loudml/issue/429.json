Not sure what went wrong but I dont have anything in the etc folder that is connected to loudml. It installed in the root. It did not create the loudml.yml file. I have since installed the full stack but I would guess I need to uinstall and reinstall? Did not find any directions to uninstall. \r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/429/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
