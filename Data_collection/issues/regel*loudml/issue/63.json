I would guess that the higher this value, the longer the model takes to train, but does accuracy remain consistent with the same `max_eval` number between use cases (differing bucket size, signal period, signal noise, etc.)? If it does, how would you suggest I quantitatively determine what number is good for me (seeing accuracy vs training time)? I am only developing a Kibana plugin on top of it, so I can't predict the variety of use cases and data characteristics that will be used.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you could tell me what a good value is? :smiley_cat: ","closed_by":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
