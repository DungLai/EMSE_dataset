With Loud is it possible to provide some sort of Elasticsearch-Lucene query to reduce the data set.\r\nExample I have all my SSH Logins/Failures in one index, but I really only want to create a model based on a few servers – Lucene query like: “host:server OR host:server2 OR host:server3” – would provide the correct data.\r\n\r\n2). Is there integration with Grafana (not Chronograf) available? – I think this would be a killer feature, because then I could leverage the Elasticsearch datastore with the Grafana GUI and get Loud predictions in GUI format.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/70/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/70/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
