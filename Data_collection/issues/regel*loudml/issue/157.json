I saw in another ticket some people were using \"type\":\"timeseries\". When I try to use this, I am told the type does not exist. Is this something I would need to load? \r\n\r\n2. Should I be able to run a count of a non-numeric field? Ideally, I'd like to do something like train on something like the count of \"Deny\" actions in the firewall log. It seems like filtering the data based on this may be possible, but can't verify if I can run it that way since I can't any sort of model working.
