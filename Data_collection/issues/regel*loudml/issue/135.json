We are using chronograf for multiple customers (each influx database for each customers) with multiple organisation. \r\nSay example I have a customer1 and the DB looks like customer1_db and the chronograf org looks like customer1. This will continue as customer2,3 etc.\r\nIs there any plan to add this feature with chronograf? so that we offer ML possibilities to our customers.\r\nAlso, we noticed that the chronograf version is old (1.6), we are using 1.7.11 to get flux support.\r\nIt would be great if you can use the latest version of chronograf.
