I get data once per day. So, for one year we have 365 days * 1 = 365 data points and trained the model with 9 years data, 2009 - 2018. once it's trained, I haven't noticed any abnormal or anomaly window in training data. \r\n![data explorer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291662-d2ddb300-1801-11ea-9a20-b50fc0425b69.png)\r\n![Baseline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291620-afb30380-1801-11ea-836c-9d49c3598dbe.png)\r\n\r\nThen i tried to predict the anomaly from 2019-Jan-01, But there is no anomaly predicted or shown in the chronograf dashboard.

Does it needs to be changed in my use case?\r\n5.For model configuration attached the screenshots.Whether configuration needs to be changed?**\r\n![md-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291475-2e5b7100-1801-11ea-8067-a335729cc2c2.png)\r\n![md-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291551-81352880-1801-11ea-9608-c9898a415359.png)\r\n![md-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291552-81352880-1801-11ea-9c25-ebc00fc23b5b.png)\r\n![md-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291554-81cdbf00-1801-11ea-8dc7-e0d6a5b07f5a.png)\r\n![md-5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291556-81cdbf00-1801-11ea-8b86-5a5a2df19199.png)\r\n![md-6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70291557-82665580-1801-11ea-8e02-f59d84a8f90c.png)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
