From what I understood from the docs, you can only define tag k/v pairs as filters to select a specific series, but if LoudML could train a model for each series of the measurement depending on a configured set of tags (e.g. all values of tags x and y, or an array of tags values), and output accordingly, I think it would be a great addition.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
