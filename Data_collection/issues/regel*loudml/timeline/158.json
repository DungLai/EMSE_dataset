See file `donut.py` line 123. The other component is KL loss calculated on the VAE latent space data. Our current implementation differs from the original DONUT that parametrize the variance, whereas ours is using log_var. This leads to a different loss value.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef add_loss(model, W):\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis variant of VAE loss is modified (calculation of beta) to discard the effect of abnormal data points during loss computation. This interesting idea is discussed in DONUT paper.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/557868965/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/559477332","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/158#issuecomment-559477332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/158","id":559477332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTQ3NzMzMg==","user":{"login":"Xavear","id":10222810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjIyODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10222810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear","html_url":"https://github.com/Xavear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xavear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-28T12:32:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T12:32:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Dear Regel,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.
