In the TICK-L we solved this scenario with a \"locked\" panel. Certain settings (eg the features list, bucket interval, span, forecast) cannot be changed once the model is trained, due to ML topology constraint. We still have to document it, and throw an exception if an unsupported change is requested to the API.\r\n\r\nYou can use this POST call for example to change the interval value, offset, and anomaly thresholds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/431393873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1915002526,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkxNTAwMjUyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/1915002526","actor":{"login":"daradermody","id":7104356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7104356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody","html_url":"https://github.com/daradermody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-19T15:03:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1915002528,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5MTUwMDI1Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/1915002528","actor":{"login":"daradermody","id":7104356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7104356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody","html_url":"https://github.com/daradermody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-19T15:03:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2160970662,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxNjA5NzA2NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2160970662","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-25T08:20:28Z","label":{"name":"good
