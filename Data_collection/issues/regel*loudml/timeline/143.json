What links are broken exactly?\r\n\r\nDocumentation is deployed by Netlify and seems to work at https://loudml.io\r\n\r\nDocker images are on docker hub. The latest Docker images include CPU or GPU support; fyi there is no GPU support in the RPM - DEB files. Docker tag '*-latest' are automatically rebuilt every night after checkout of the master revision.\r\n\r\nA small hack: for .rpm or .deb pre-built packages, can you try to access CircleCI artifacts where we build the master branch continuously?\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n- https://circleci.com/gh/regel/loudml/tree/master\r\n- Click on `build-rpm` or `build-deb` jobs, and then click on the Artifacts tab to download the files\r\n\r\nOr (worst-case) repeating the build by checking out the master and running the relevant make tasks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/531149496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/534602245","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/143#issuecomment-534602245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/143","id":534602245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDYwMjI0NQ==","user":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T15:05:45Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T15:05:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The
