Hi, thank you for your contribution! Let me have a look.\r\n\r\n>You should plan to add the possibility to write prediction to another datasource than the one used to learn.\r\n\r\nOur docs really need an update. You can do it. Your model description can define a \"source\" and a \"sink\". Your JSON settings can include the following parameters. If you want all predictions in the same index     you can set `\"default_datasink\": \"loudml\"` and they will be saved and tagged according to the model name.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"default_datasource\": \"your_input_source\",\r\n    \"default_datasink\": \"your_output_source\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nSinks and sources use the same syntax in your config.yml and sit under the datasources list.\r\n\r\nOur main struggle with ES is to maintain compatibility with all versions. The official py library claims compatibility with only one major release. The root cause of the .keyword issue (and similar with long timestamp rather than dates) is the change in how to PUT an index template.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFor Elasticsearch 7.0 and later, use the major version 7 (7.x.y) of the library.\r\n\r\nFor Elasticsearch 6.0 and later, use the major version 6 (6.x.y) of the library.\r\n\r\nFor Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, use the major version 5 (5.x.y) of the library.\r\n\r\nFor Elasticsearch 2.0 and later, use the major version 2 (2.x.y) of the library, and so
