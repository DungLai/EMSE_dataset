They are not critical unless you see too many of them and they cause training to fail. This log line warns you that it's not possible to calculate the average for certain timestamps. Two common root causes:\r\n1. no data for certain time interval. They are easily ignored, and you can set a `default` setting in your model file to force a specific value when this happens.\r\n2. You see a lot of these warnings. Perhaps the TSDB query did not return any data at all? In this case, log the query received (or sent to) the TSDB to investigate.\r\n\r\n@pahowart : Yes, `retention_policy` should help. Sorry that it's missing in the [documentation](https://loudml.io/en/loudml/reference/master/settings.html). I'm adding it now. Thanks Paul for catching this.\r\n
