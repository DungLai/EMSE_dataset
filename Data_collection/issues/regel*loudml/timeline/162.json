Anomalies are not flagged in training data.\r\nYou can exclude let say one year from your training set, and then _evaluate_ the model on this last year. Offline analysis is certainly more flexible via the command line. I will give an example in a future post.\r\n\r\n2. Annotations are useful in Chronograf to highlight time windows. They insert white markers in visualisations.\r\n\r\n3. Timezones should be ok. InfluxDb should deal with TZ in queries.\r\n\r\n4. The interval is only used in live mode when you collect new data and need to flag outliers right away. This setting should be higher or equal to your bucket_interval. With 1.5 we refer to start&stop operations to enable or disable live mode. The interval can be changed at any time, before or after training.\r\n\r\n5. Configuration looks good. Your span is 10 (10*1d) and thatâ€™s good to learn 7d patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/562462823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/563098611","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/162#issuecomment-563098611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/162","id":563098611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzA5ODYxMQ==","user":{"login":"suresh4bitsnbytes","id":22852268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODUyMjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22852268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes","html_url":"https://github.com/suresh4bitsnbytes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T07:19:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T07:19:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi sebastian, Thanks for the reply.\r\nI need further clarification\r\n**\"You can exclude let say one year from your training set, and then evaluate the model on this last year.

And I am using 2019's data for evaluation.\r\n\r\nHowever I am pushing 2019 data one after another with a sleep interval of 2 minutes. (In the configurations, the interval is 60s and offset is 10s, bucket interval is 1 day ).\r\nIn spite of data having anomalies, the anomalies are not flagged.\r\n\r\nFor reference attached the screenshot. In the below screenshot in February and May month data has anomaly.\r\n![Prediction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22852268/70413758-2fe59d00-1a7e-11ea-9521-4b62f2a17624.png)\r\n\r\nActually my agenda is once anomaly is flagged, it needs to be notified via kapacitor.\r\n\r\nAlso I have seen the examples which has weekly/hourly pattern repeating. But my case the pattern repeats yearly once, Will this algorithm suitable for my data pattern? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/563098611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"suresh4bitsnbytes","id":22852268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODUyMjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22852268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes","html_url":"https://github.com/suresh4bitsnbytes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suresh4bitsnbytes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
