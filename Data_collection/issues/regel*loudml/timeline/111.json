I'm using the official Tensorflow [Dockerfile](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.13/tensorflow/tools/dockerfiles) named devel-cpu.Dockerfile. Building this container gives a clean build environment. The bazel version environment variable must be changed according to the version we want to build.

Use a volume to include the `tests` directory. Use a second volume to exchange files in read/write mode with the host. Edit `build-cpu.sh` file, remove the avx option, remove `rm /tmp/pip` command. I also editing the --branch option to checkout r1.13 version. Then run the script. This will output the wheel file in `/tmp/pip`. Save this file to the output volume for later use.\r\n\r\n3. Use `cpu.Dockerfile` and edit this file in order to use and install the wheel file from above. This should build a base container, without AVX. I will try to push this base image to the loudml docker account and use it to release the -no-avx images of loudml containers. I want to try this last step with stretch-slim rather than Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n4. Unit testing everything.
