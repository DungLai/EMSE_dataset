the standard version runs fine in our CICD testing so it should work out of the box in your setup too. If you install `loudml-base` package together with `loudml` and remove all other PIP local packages, you will have a clean environment using TF 1.12 (vendor dependency in loudml-base) and all other dependencies needed.\r\n\r\nUsing PIP local installs can break things everywhere and enters the 'danger zone'. Using `loudml-base` is a convenient way to pin our dependencies and test the packages with a reproducible environment.\r\n\r\nIf you need to use a specific package please let us know why so we can take this into consideration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/514952247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2508736916,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUwODczNjkxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2508736916","actor":{"login":"toni-moreno","id":5883405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5883405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno","html_url":"https://github.com/toni-moreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-25T08:35:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2508736920,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MDg3MzY5MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2508736920","actor":{"login":"toni-moreno","id":5883405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5883405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno","html_url":"https://github.com/toni-moreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-25T08:35:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/517446823","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/108#issuecomment-517446823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/108","id":517446823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzQ0NjgyMw==","user":{"login":"toni-moreno","id":5883405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5883405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno","html_url":"https://github.com/toni-moreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toni-moreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T20:31:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T20:31:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
