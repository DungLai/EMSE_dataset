The following message is printed on screen.\r\n```\r\npkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'loudml==1.5.0' distribution was not found and is required by the application\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Root Cause Analysis\r\nAt the time the packages were built, Python 3.4 was the default Python 3 interpreter for CentOS 7. Since then, Python 3.6 has become the default interpreter. As a result, the programs are now started with an interpreter that cannot load the Loud ML packages.\r\n\r\n## Bugfix\r\nRebuild the packages for Python 3.6. Make sure the packages depend on that version.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nForce the interpreter to be Python 3.4.\r\n```\r\n$ sudo yum install -y python34 python34-setuptools\r\n$ sudo sed -i \"s/python3/python3.4/\" /usr/bin/loudml\r\n$ sudo sed -i \"s/python3/python3.4/\"
