Debian, Ubuntu, EL7?\r\n\r\nYou can use `nvidia-smi` to verify that the GPU tensor cores are effectively in use by a Python process. This will tell you the process and load on the GPU.\r\n\r\nThe current master (1.5.0) packages the CPU version only. Loud ML was tested on a P100 in GCP but this is not yet reflected in the master branch. We will roll out packaging enhancements to make GPU usage easier. Please watch the repository for the next pull requests.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# nvidia-smi \r\nThu Nov 22 23:36:20 2018       \r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| NVIDIA-SMI 410.72       Driver Version: 410.72       CUDA Version: 10.0     |\r\n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

My initial idea was to replace the `loudml-base` package with two packages: `loudml-cpu`, and `loudml-gpu` and let users choose the package they need at install time. I find GPU support easier with `conda` than `pip` but moving to conda adds extra packaging work and I could not find the hours to do it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/513154731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/520136448","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/104#issuecomment-520136448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/104","id":520136448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDEzNjQ0OA==","user":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-10T10:05:35Z","updated_at":"2019-08-10T10:05:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Try: `docker pull loudml/loudml:latest-devel-gpu`\r\n\r\nThis image is built and pushed by the CICD pipeline and will be updated automatically with all changes made in the `master` branch.
