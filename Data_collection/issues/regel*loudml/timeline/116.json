Can we close this ticket? You can always respond to the ticket to reopen it if needed.\r\n\r\n@nonostar is correct. Loud ML installs a local user and group (loudml:loudml) and the loudmld daemon should run as this unprivileged user. This also means the files in `/var/lib/loudml` must belong to the `loudml` group.\r\n\r\nIf you are using the CLI, you will need to add your local user to secondary group `loudml`, then logout from your Linux session, and log in again.\r\n\r\nYou can find a note in the documentation:
