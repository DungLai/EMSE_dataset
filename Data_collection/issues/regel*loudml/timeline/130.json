Dependency pinning takes different forms in different frameworks, but the high-level idea is to “freeze” dependencies so that deployments are repeatable. Without this, we run the risk of executing different software whenever servers are restaged, a new team-member joins the project, or between development and production environments. In addition to repeatability, pinning dependencies allows automatic notification of vulnerable dependencies via static analysis.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a virtual-env you can run the command below to install all loudml dependencies with the official versions that are used in the test environment:\r\n\r\n`pip install -r base/vendor/requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm working on TF 1.13.2 support and the no-avx build too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/517983419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/517985352","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/130#issuecomment-517985352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/130","id":517985352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzk4NTM1Mg==","user":{"login":"lblabr","id":5998943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTg5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5998943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr","html_url":"https://github.com/lblabr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lblabr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-04T08:46:55Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T08:46:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i
