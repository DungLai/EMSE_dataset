If the bucket interval is too low, high-frequency noise in the data will trigger false positives. If span (that is: the window of observation) is too low, the same thing will happen.\r\n\r\nHelpful heuristics:\r\n\r\n- Span window size should be at least equal to the periodicity in the signal\r\n- Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem: bucket interval should be smaller than 0.5 * 1/max_hz_frequency otherwise there will be a loss of information\r\n\r\nSo it's good to know the expected HZ and periodicity characteristics of the signal before setting parameters and training the model.\r\n\r\nOne nice enhancement in donut.py would be to set bucket_interval='auto', span='auto', compute the discrete FFT, and apply settings automatically according to the above heuristic if the parameters were not set by the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/594344973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
