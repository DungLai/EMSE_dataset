@daradermody, what are your min_threshold and max_threshold settings?\r\n\r\nTip: we've introduced in 1.4 the ability to set min_threshold=0 and max_threshold=0 to let loudmld calculate these values.\r\n\r\nThe hysteresis goes like this during the anomaly detection:\r\n - New anomaly starts if score >= max_threshold\r\n - Anomaly ends if the score < min_threshold\r\n\r\n1.4.2 in more detail:\r\n - Scores are calculated either using the L1 norm (the default), or a gaussian distribution.\r\n - lower_* and upper_* have first been introduced to display graphs, and use 68–95–99.7 empirical rule based on the training MSE to calculate an interval.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/432945814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1925416838,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkyNTQxNjgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/1925416838","actor":{"login":"daradermody","id":7104356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7104356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody","html_url":"https://github.com/daradermody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-25T07:34:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1925416839,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5MjU0MTY4Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/1925416839","actor":{"login":"daradermody","id":7104356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7104356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody","html_url":"https://github.com/daradermody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-25T07:34:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/433030980","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/57#issuecomment-433030980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/57","id":433030980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzAzMDk4MA==","user":{"login":"daradermody","id":7104356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7104356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody","html_url":"https://github.com/daradermody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daradermody/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T12:28:08Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T12:28:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For
