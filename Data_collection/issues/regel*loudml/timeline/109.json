The ES API changes in each release (5.x, 6.x, and 7.x). The official Python libs made available by Elastic only support one major release.\r\n\r\nThe error that you see is caused by an index mapping that wasn't installed properly, so timestamp and keywords are not using the correct data types. You can run a curl query on the indices to get the actual index mapping and data types.\r\n\r\nWhat is your ES version?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/514945390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2508681343,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUwODY4MTM0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2508681343","actor":{"login":"kang589","id":48878624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODc4NjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48878624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589","html_url":"https://github.com/kang589","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-25T08:15:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2508681344,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MDg2ODEzNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2508681344","actor":{"login":"kang589","id":48878624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODc4NjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48878624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589","html_url":"https://github.com/kang589","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kang589/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-25T08:15:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/534950718","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/109#issuecomment-534950718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/109","id":534950718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDk1MDcxOA==","user":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T10:05:22Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T10:05:22Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Waiting
