Yes, that is the new behavior. Before I expected the `measurement` field to translate to the `doc_type`, which it didn't. You can see issue #42 for more info. \r\n\r\nIt's strange that it doesn't work. You could probably use tcpdump/wireshark to sniff the outgoing request and check what payload is being sent. If you have a custom document type on ES, then you need to set the `doc_type` in the `config.yml`. As stated in the documentation the default is `doc`. The `doc_type` changes the URL of the request, and would not return
