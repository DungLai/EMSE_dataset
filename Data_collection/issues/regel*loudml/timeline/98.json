Sad to hear it was dropped. Is is it a lot of work to add it back? _Maybe_ I can try and help.\r\n\r\nAs an example let's say I'm trying to replicate the forecasting part of the Google experiment here:\r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/\r\n\r\nIn which case I would have weather data as an _[autoregressive]_ input, a few other _[more or less independent]_ inputs, and I'm trying to predict the value of datacenter temperature, an autoregressive dependent variable.\r\n\r\nSo we'd have:\r\n - `x_t_1 .. x_t_c` - autoregressive _ex. outside_temperature, amount_of_sunlight, TOD, DOY, cooling_fan_speed, air_conditioning_power, etc_\r\n - `x_t_c+1 ... x_t_k` - static parameters _ex., datacenter_insulation_factor, datacenter_empty_volume, etc._\r\n - `y_t` - target variable _i.e. datacenter_temperature_\r\n\r\nI would probably learn and predict this at different locations inside the datacenter, and across multiple such datacenters.\r\n\r\n_Edit: of course I would not try to predict the weather, but instead would use a weather forecast in order to predict future values for the `datacenter_temperature` variable._","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/467646768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sorinmuchi","id":6254724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTQ3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6254724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi","html_url":"https://github.com/sorinmuchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2166395345,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE2NjM5NTM0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2166395345","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-26T22:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2166395346,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNjYzOTUzNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2166395346","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-26T22:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/476240866","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/98#issuecomment-476240866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/98","id":476240866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjI0MDg2Ng==","user":{"login":"sorinmuchi","id":6254724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTQ3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6254724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi","html_url":"https://github.com/sorinmuchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorinmuchi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-25T15:12:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T15:12:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@regel

Can we find this data set publicly or privately exchange data?\r\n\r\n@lephisto Yes it will be back.\r\n\r\nSo I've been cleaning up a few things. The CLI is moving to its own [package](https://github.com/loudml/loudml-python) and will be available on PyPI. This is WIP but almost done. Then I will fix #22 and #98 will be the next one on my list.\r\n\r\nOur current goal is to create well-designed client libraries that consume the server API over HTTP. They will be available at https://github.com/loudml.
