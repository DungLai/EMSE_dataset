it's a great start! Happy to find a new contributor :)\r\n\r\nI will help, don't worry. \r\n\r\nRefactoring is ongoing on the master branch. It will make things easier (I hope!). The \"Datasource\" class will be renamed \"Bucket\".\r\n\r\nThe basic requirements to make it work:\r\n\r\n1. Write `loudml/loudml/opentsdb.py` file with a class inherited from the parent Bucket class, then declare this class in setup.py. Your class must implement __init__(), init(), drop(), insert_times_data(), and get_times_data(). You can have a SCHEMA class variable used to declare and validate the config.yml file format. Examples in influx.py. This file mainly builds date histogram aggregations in the format expected by the TSDB, runs the query, and returns data and timestamps. The `misc.py` file contains helpers to work with timestamps.\r\n2. Please avoid pandas. We want to keep it simple and avoid extra dependencies. It's better if everything is contained in one file.\r\n3. Write a unit test file `loudml/tests/test_opentsdb.py`. You can copy/paste most of the content from `test_elastic.py` or `test_influx.py`\r\n4. Update the `.circleci/config.yml` to test with OpenTSDB latest version. It should be a copy/paste of the existing configuration for other TSDBs.\r\n5. Last but not least, add your name in the Contributors section of the top README file!\r\n\r\nI review new pull-requests with @osunac \r\n\r\nLet us know if you have questions or get stuck on something. I will let you know when the Bucket refactoring is completed and merged on `master`.\r\n\r\nWe know OpenTSDB users who will be happy to test a new release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/533001848/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2645901893,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY0NTkwMTg5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2645901893","actor":{"login":"osunac","id":12576592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTc2NTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12576592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac","html_url":"https://github.com/osunac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-19T07:19:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2645901894,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NDU5MDE4OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2645901894","actor":{"login":"osunac","id":12576592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTc2NTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12576592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac","html_url":"https://github.com/osunac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osunac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-19T07:19:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/533228166","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/91#issuecomment-533228166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/91","id":533228166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzIyODE2Ng==","user":{"login":"langerma","id":6053589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTM1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6053589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma","html_url":"https://github.com/langerma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/langerma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T17:21:17Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T17:21:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"cool!
