With a 2 day forecast chunk the forecast profile lags the day of week by 2 days.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the model seems to be replaying a crude 'echo' of the actual value from 1 or 2 days previously. When there are anomalies in the actuals these also produce an 'echo' in the forecast.\r\n\r\neval-model does not seem to show the same 'echo' behaviour and the 'forecast' profile fits with the expected pattern for the day of the week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/723180270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andycarlsonuk","id":13467577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDY3NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13467577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk","html_url":"https://github.com/andycarlsonuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarlsonuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
