That is of course very useful for many cases, but depends on the objective. For example, nodes can come and go, so the values of the node tag will change over time. At the same time I would be interested in a separate prediction/forecast for each node, on a single field key. That would be a group by without any where on the tags. From your outline, I’m not sure if that would be considered one or multiple models (from a licensing perspective). \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/414474540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"voiprodrigo","id":2421504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjE1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2421504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo","html_url":"https://github.com/voiprodrigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voiprodrigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/414656484","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/36#issuecomment-414656484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/36","id":414656484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDY1NjQ4NA==","user":{"login":"jorgelbg","id":1291846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTE4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1291846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgelbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T12:28:19Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T12:28:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think I have a similar use case as the one @voiprodrigo describes.
