Your are not allowed to run a container as root\r\n2. The user that runs the container is not known by name. That means he has only a random user id on the OS level.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did to make it work:\r\n```\r\nFROM loudml:latest-devel\r\nRUN chgrp -R 0 /var/lib/loudml && \\\r\n    chmod -R g=u /var/lib/loudml && \\\r\n    chgrp 0 /etc/passwd && \\\r\n    chmod g=u /etc/passwd\r\nCMD cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd && \\\r\n    sed -i \"s/loudml:x:...:...../loudml:x:$(id -u):0/\" /tmp/passwd && \\\r\n    truncate -s 0 /etc/passwd && \\\r\n    cat /tmp/passwd >> /etc/passwd && \\\r\n    rm /tmp/passwd && \\\r\n    /usr/bin/loudmld\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n1. Make /var/lib/loudml accessible for a non-privileged user:\r\n```\r\nchgrp -R 0 /var/lib/loudml\r\nchmod -R g=u /var/lib/loudml\r\n```\r\nThis is exactly what OpenShift suggests to do according to their documentation.\r\n\r\n2. Make /etc/passwd accessible for a non-privileged user:\r\n```\r\nchgrp 0 /etc/passwd\r\nchmod g=u /etc/passwd\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Ensure that at runtime (when we know the user id), we hack a username into the system that is necessary for the service to run. When there is no username associated to the user id, the service will not run:\r\n```\r\nCMD cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd && \\\r\n    sed -i \"s/loudml:x:...:...../loudml:x:$(id -u):0/\" /tmp/passwd && \\\r\n    truncate -s 0 /etc/passwd && \\\r\n    cat /tmp/passwd >> /etc/passwd && \\\r\n    rm /tmp/passwd && \\\r\n    /usr/bin/loudmld\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far using this patch LoudML works well on our OpenShift cluster.
