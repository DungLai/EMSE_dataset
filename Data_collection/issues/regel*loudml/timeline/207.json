I noticed the questions but some may be out of scope for Github issues. \r\n\r\nLoud ML is first designed to make ML easier to use and more accessible. One first model supported is specialized for anomaly detection use-cases. However, we aim for a larger audience and new ML model implementations can be added (eg. add your own) and contributed in order to open new verticals and new applications. Refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the code of conduct for more information. Loud ML is free software and I invite everyone to contribute.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/594349104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3208605716,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzIwODYwNTcxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/3208605716","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-07T07:44:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
