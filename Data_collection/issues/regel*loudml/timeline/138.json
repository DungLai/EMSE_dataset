@robcowart for Elasticsearch setup. What is your Elasticsearch version?\r\n\r\nYou can totally run it with Kubernetes and pods. You can get more logs on the server using `journalctl -xfeu loudmld`\r\n\r\nVery nice to see you are using the POST queries. fyi we are now creating API clients in Python, Go, and Javascript for easier integration. Url for these new OSS projects: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/loudml/loudml-python\r\n- https://github.com/loudml/loudml-go\r\n- https://github.com/loudml/loudml-js\r\n\r\nThe first release for Python and Go client libs will be available in the coming days and we will probably cut a 1.6.0 release in a short while.\r\n\r\nContributions and ideas are welcome! We need help for Javascript
