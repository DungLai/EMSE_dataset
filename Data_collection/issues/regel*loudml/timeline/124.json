did you install/build the no-AVX version?\r\n\r\nI noticed in the logs that you have TF 1.14. Our current reference version is 1.12 and will be upgraded to 1.13.2. The new docker images will use 1.13.2, and use tags for gpu / or noavx - according to your needs.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Docker you will see the learning curve is fast.\r\n\r\n- Dockerfiles are used to build the image\r\n- Our Docker images expose port 8077/tcp. This is the port where `loudmld` is listening for HTTP queries.\r\n- You can find more documentation about docker input arguments on this [page](https://hub.docker.com/r/loudml/community). The `-v` flags are super useful because you want to map local files and directories on your host to files and directories in the container. This is how you can persist configuration settings and save/re-use your model files across runs.
