The optimizer is quite robust with respect to this initialization, but still it might be the cause. In `compute_bucket_scores` you use the midvalue as an estimator of the mean, which in turn is not robust, so maybe this is the source of the problem, as it is exactly the \"y_low_high\" test that fails.\r\n\r\n> Unit tests main intent is to avoid functional regression when the software changes, like upgrading a package dependency, making changes to a function, etc.\r\n\r\nThen I will try to run `donut.py` as standalone.

It's easy to roll out a VAE baseline model and compare.\r\n\r\nI did this, where I chose a dataset in which the first differences were _approximately_ normally distributed (most of the ones I used so far share this property) and just applied a Grubbs outlier test (level of significance = 0.005) on the differences. Note that this approach is very naive, hence serves quite well as a baseline.

I simply suspect that the architecture of the autoencoder is suboptimal. So is there a particular reason you changed the architecture for the network (did it perform better or equally well on some data)? I assume you are aware that you work with about half the layers as DONUT, correct? Lastly, have you checked the issue mentioned in my first post (latent loss function)? If not, just link me the paper or article you used to compute the loss and I will check!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/517714858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"EpsDel","id":53219730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjE5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53219730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel","html_url":"https://github.com/EpsDel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EpsDel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2531926641,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1MzE5MjY2NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2531926641","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d899806f75949cb2fe38ee5f6082d199c5b6e20c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/commits/d899806f75949cb2fe38ee5f6082d199c5b6e20c","created_at":"2019-08-04T19:47:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2532964673,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1MzI5NjQ2NzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2532964673","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f9b68eb0f1c78672d547364753539291ac5850fe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/commits/f9b68eb0f1c78672d547364753539291ac5850fe","created_at":"2019-08-05T09:56:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2533572312,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1MzM1NzIzMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/events/2533572312","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"463898365344abc51075a1b513a6527f99b4b7ab","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/commits/463898365344abc51075a1b513a6527f99b4b7ab","created_at":"2019-08-05T13:45:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.co
