A refactoring is in progress. We now split the server code and client code. You should see the changes in getting started documentation.\r\n\r\nThe CLI moved to PyPI. Search ‘loudml-python’ on PyPI and readthedocs for more info. So the client can now connect to a remote Loud ML « node » (or cluster).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we also package other client libraries for JavaScript and Go to facilitate the integration with other apps and increase our test coverage. Work in progress.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/542528934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/542542091","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/152#issuecomment-542542091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/152","id":542542091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjU0MjA5MQ==","user":{"login":"camAtGitHub","id":2858315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTgzMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2858315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub","html_url":"https://github.com/camAtGitHub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camAtGitHub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T06:29:04Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T06:29:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok
