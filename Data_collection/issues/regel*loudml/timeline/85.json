So, if the --from parameter is \"now\", then loudml is querying the data source to load the window with data points in range [now-span*bucket_interval, now[\r\n\r\nThis first window must not have any missing data point, else the forecast will not be able to produce an output.\r\n\r\nTips and workarounds:\r\n\r\n- Use --from \"now-1m\" or small negative offset to ensure the first window does not have \"null\" data points\r\n- Control the bucket_interval in model settings, and verify if the buckets are empty (any warnings observed on the CLI)\r\n- Use default: \"previous\", or default: <float> in your feature definition to assign a default value in case there are no previous data point in the TSDB\r\n\r\nOur next release 1.5 will have much more advanced forecast functions. Let us know how this can help your business to join the beta and 1.5 early access crew.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/458628949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/comments/466907642","html_url":"https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/85#issuecomment-466907642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/regel/loudml/issues/85","id":466907642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjkwNzY0Mg==","user":{"login":"regel","id":355557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/355557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel","html_url":"https://github.com/regel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T07:58:39Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T07:58:39Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@sukotha : closing this question.
