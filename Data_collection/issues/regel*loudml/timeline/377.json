Toni, ok I understand the setup. I reproduced a similar setup, with read-only access to a database and write-only access to a second database. There are multiple issues. Some of them are solved. See the setup here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/regel/loudml/pull/383\r\n\r\nLong story short: annotations were historically saved in a special 'chronograf' database for compatibility with the Javascript UI. Loud ML needs read-write access to annotations DB in order to read and write abnormal time windows and exclude them from future training operations.\r\n\r\nI have to patch the Javascript UI to finish this bug fix.
