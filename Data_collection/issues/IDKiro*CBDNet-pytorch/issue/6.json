However, I noticed some strange behaviour of noise level prediction sub-network. I downloaded the datasests and run training with default parameters. While training I also dump the predicted noise map and in the middle of the first epoch I see that the predicted noise in most cases consists of zeros only. I tried modifying the weights in loss but it does not help. Actually, what I see is that the network without noise prediction tends to work better. Could you, please, give any comments on this? Am I doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":{"login":"IDKiro","id":24263261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYzMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24263261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro","html_url":"https://github.com/IDKiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
