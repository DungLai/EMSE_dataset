因为训练数据集不一样，loss各部分的权重需要修改，因为FCN这时候输出全0，这样噪声图的TV loss最小，可能是这一项支配了整个训练过程；\r\n2. 代码写错了，比较可能的是训练数据sample错了；\r\n\r\n我觉得1比较可能吧，因为训练数据合成噪声的时候，噪声水平的取样方式变了，导致平均噪声水平比原文低，进而导致噪声水平监督这一项值变小，被其他两项支配了，导致FCN功能退化。\r\n至于噪声水平监督有没有用，应该是有用的，你可以理解为正则作用，不过可能在训练集足够大时作用被稀释。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/comments/812304546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"IDKiro","id":24263261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYzMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24263261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro","html_url":"https://github.com/IDKiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/comments/812306266","html_url":"https://github.com/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/21#issuecomment-812306266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/21","id":812306266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjMwNjI2Ng==","user":{"login":"IDKiro","id":24263261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYzMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24263261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro","html_url":"https://github.com/IDKiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-02T04:11:03Z","updated_at":"2021-04-02T04:11:03Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"我没时间去排查具体的问题，所以现在更新了README作为提醒，你要是排查出问题可以pull。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/comments/812306266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"IDKiro","id":24263261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYzMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24263261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro","html_url":"https://github.com/IDKiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/comments/813031048","html_url":"https://github.com/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/21#issuecomment-813031048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IDKiro/CBDNet-pytorch/issues/21","id":813031048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzAzMTA0OA==","user":{"login":"IDKiro","id":24263261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYzMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24263261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro","html_url":"https://github.com/IDKiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IDKiro/received_events
