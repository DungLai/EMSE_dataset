I found Wordless would crash multiple times, especially for n-gram, collocation extractor. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that's because of the size of the corpus. From the profiler, there are 10909 paragraphs, and 172885 tokens, 581964 characters. I remember I tried with small files, but the app crashed too. \r\n\r\nI'm on macOS 12.3.1 with M1 Pro chip. I tried another Macbook with intel chip but had the same experience. Wordless version: 2.2.0.\r\n\r\nThe path to Wordless doesn't have any non-ASCII characters, though file names are in Tibetan and Chinese. \r\n\r\nI do have the crash report that generated by the system, but not sure if that's helpful. Please let me know what other information are needed for investigation. \r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"BLKSerene","id":23695743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjk1NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23695743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene","html_url":"https://github.com/BLKSerene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLKSerene/Wordless/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BLKSerene/Wordless/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
