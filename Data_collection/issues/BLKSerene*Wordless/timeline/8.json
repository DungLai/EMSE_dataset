I am using the latest vision you post on the Github and downloaded via BaiduNetdisk. It should be vision 1.1.0 I guess. Btw, this problem also happened when I first use this tool vision 1.0.0. \nEvery time I open the folder it will breakdown when importing. The system I am using is MacOS 10.14.3 and the data we use in this research is about 25,000 texts encoded with UTF8. I tried over ten times and there are only two times the software successfully imported all the data, but an unexpected problem happed when I run the function of “general”, for exploring the general situation of these texts including types, tokens, and TTR, etc.. The interface shows a remind: two files are not encoded with UTF8 and will not be included. Then the software totally breakdown and I cannot do anything but force close it. The attachment is part of the data I used.\n\nWordless is such an integrated software for our corpus research and we are so excited when I first found it from my friend’s message. We will be grateful if you can help us overcome the problem and make it useful in our following researches. Also, I am happy to help you and your team make the great software better and best!  Thanks and I am looking forward to your help !!\n\n\nJiekun\nLinguistic Lab, Northeastern University\n2019年4月26日，下午6:19，BLKSerene <notifications@github.com> 写道：\n> \n> Hi, what version of Wordless are you using?
