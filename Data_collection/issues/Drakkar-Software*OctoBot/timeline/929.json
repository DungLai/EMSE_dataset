Currently OctoBot only supports 1 reference market. So if you want to use EUR as reference market when you use backtesting you should first modify your `reference_market` to EUR and then run a backtesting.

OctoBot implement different type of `evaluators` and you can only backtest technical indicators ones. For example, a lot of strategies use real time evaluators that currently can't be backtested. So your backtesting may be false sometimes.

you are using the Strategy optimizer, it is currently a POC as [Herklos said](https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/928#issuecomment-503685463), the starting portfolio in this specific mode is preset to work with the dataset (which is in the test folder, it's the same dataset we use to experiment strategies internally).\r\nIf you want to test strategies on specific markets, it's better to collect the data yourself and run a regular backtesting directly on them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/505643144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GuillaumeDSM","id":9078616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzg2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9078616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM","html_url":"https://github.com/GuillaumeDSM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/569709280","html_url":"https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/929#issuecomment-569709280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/929","id":569709280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTcwOTI4MA==","user":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://github.com/Herklos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-30T15:24:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T15:24:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed
