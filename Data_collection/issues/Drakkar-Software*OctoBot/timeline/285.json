pudong1,\r\nYou actually don't even have to replace **test_binance_websocket.py**, you can leave it as is. All tests should pass if you leave all data in **tests/static/config.json**. To test bitmex (if you need to test it, see bellow), you can add a bitmex config in this same file. **tests/static/config.json** should then have something like this:\r\n```json\r\n\"exchanges\": {\r\n    \"binance\": {\r\n      \"api-key\": \"\",\r\n      \"api-secret\": \"\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"bitmex\": {\r\n      \"api-key\": \"\",\r\n      \"api-secret\": \"\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUsing this solution, all existing tests should pass and you can add tests for bitmex additionnaly to the existing ones.\r\n\r\nAbout the second part of the question, we don't automatically test ccxt exchange specific interfaces (we leave it to ccxt), therefore if you want to use the rest interface to interact with bitmex, no tests are necessary to be built. \r\nThe only existing exchanges specific tests are in **test_binance_websocket.py** and it tests the implementation of the websocket interface of binance exchange, which is the only websocket interface we developped for now.\r\nFor you, if you want to use the websocket service of OctoBot to interact with bitmex (if bitmex provides a websocket interface), you will have to implement an equivalent of **trading/exchanges/websocket/implementations/binance_websocket.py** for bitmex. In order to do this, you need to extend the **AbstractWebSocket** class and implement all abstract methods (just like **binance_websocket.py** does). \r\nIn this case it makes sense to create a **test_bitmex_websocket.py** in OctoBot's tests to test your websocket interface implementation.\r\n\r\nThank you for using OctoBot !\r\n\r\nGuillaume","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/402395805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GuillaumeDSM","id":9078616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzg2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9078616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM","html_url":"https://github.com/GuillaumeDSM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2021782559,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjAyMTc4MjU1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/2021782559","actor":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://github.com/Herklos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-12T15:22:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
