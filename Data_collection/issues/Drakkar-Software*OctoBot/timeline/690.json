\"data recorder\" you mean data_collector?\r\n => Yes, and it's evaluation neutral, it only stores exchange data that will be used in backtesting, there you can have your evaluations.\r\n\r\ni understand that backtesting module takes data in another format than The evaluation recording feature\r\n => the evaluation recording feature is to record evaluations, not exchange data (that can be turned into evalutions) to record exchange data, you have the data_collector that is accessible from the web interface and that stores data in a ready to backtest format.\r\n\r\nwhat should i add for backtest strategy with realtime evaluator(already recorded data) ?\r\n => it depends on what you mean by realtime evaluator, if you mean an evaluator extending RealtimeEvaluator, it's not implemented yet. For now backtesting supports only TA extending evaluators. If you want to test a TA extending one, you can just use the web interface to download the data you want and run a backtesting on it afterwards. If you have already recorded data not in OctoBot recording data, you will have to convert them","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/569041509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GuillaumeDSM","id":9078616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzg2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9078616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM","html_url":"https://github.com/GuillaumeDSM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
