The big difference of bitmex with other exchanges is Financial Leverage, up to 100x. During the oscillation phase where the direction is to be chosen, bollinger band is a very good indicator to fast trade, like several times or more in a day. I also know some people do the market maker at bitmex, which is also very profitable, particularly at oscillating phase. At the oscillating phase, the bot is a necessary tool to capture the buy/sell points. The fee is also less than others’.\n\nBy the way, I use the right pair for ccxt, now I can connect to bitmex and do the simulator trade. But it seems that the time frame only has two options, one hour or one day. I want to have more time frames, where can I get it?\n\nWe could discuss more about it, right now my time is deep middle night, I need go to sleep. For short, developing a bot for bitmex is a good investment, this is how I see it, which is also what I want to do with your help.

I guess if you are asking this question it means bitmex can handle other times frames than only those 2 ones.\r\nTime frames used by the bot depend on the used strategy:\r\nEach strategy has a method called get_required_time_frames() which returns the list of time frames to use. In this method, you can add as many time frames as you want like in this example from the default tentacle mixed_strategies_evaluator.py: FullMixedStrategiesEvaluator:\r\n```python\r\n@classmethod\r\ndef get_required_time_frames(cls):\r\n    return [TimeFrames.THIRTY_MINUTES,\r\n                TimeFrames.ONE_HOUR,\r\n

will help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/401621544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GuillaumeDSM","id":9078616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzg2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9078616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM","html_url":"https://github.com/GuillaumeDSM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1710370993,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTcxMDM3MDk5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/1710370993","actor":{"login":"classmethod","id":1532151,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE1MzIxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod","html_url":"https://github.com/classmethod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/classmethod/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-01T17:40:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1710419583,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxNzEwNDE5NTgz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/1710419583","actor":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://github.com/Herklos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-01T20:22:37Z","assignee":{"login":"GuillaumeDSM","id":9078616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzg2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9078616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM","html_url":"https://github.com/GuillaumeDSM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1710419601,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3MTA0MTk2MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/1710419601","actor":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://

about real trading.\r\n\r\nTheir is some problems with bitmex on ccxt that can impact Octobot. For example, the list of fees is empty, some symbols do not respect the *XXX/YYY* form, etc... \r\nConcerning **XBTUSD** it correspond to BTC/USD on ccxt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/401632483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://github.com/Herklos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1712299373,"node_id":"MDE5OkFkZGVkVG9Qcm9qZWN0RXZlbnQxNzEyMjk5Mzcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/1712299373","actor":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://github.com/Herklos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-02T18:41:38Z","project_card":{"id":11020551,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/11020551","project_id":1399799,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/1399799","column_name":"Current
