To solve this you can use the following command: ```python3 -m pip install -U \"OctoBot-Tentacles-Manager<2.0.0\"``` that should solve your import issues and you should be able to use your tentacle.\r\n\r\nFor OctoBot to see and use your tentacle, here is the process (not automated):\r\n- add an import line to import your tentacle in the ```__init__.py``` associated file\r\n- add the class of your evaluator into your ```tentacles/Evaluator/evaluator_config.json``` file alongside the others (otherwise OctoBot will import it but won't use it). This part was missing on [the wiki](https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/wiki/Customize-your-OctoBot#manual-installation), I'm adding it.\r\n\r\nNote: this process is a bit complicated and is getting much simpler with 0.4. When the beta will be out, we will update the wiki accordingly\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/625416365/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GuillaumeDSM","id":9078616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzg2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9078616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM","html_url":"https://github.com/GuillaumeDSM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeDSM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3314085519,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMxNDA4NTUxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/3314085519","actor":{"login":"Amarchuk","id":1048312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDgzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1048312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk","html_url":"https://github.com/Amarchuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-07T18:14:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3314085522,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMTQwODU1MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/3314085522","actor":{"login":"Amarchuk","id":1048312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDgzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1048312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk","html_url":"https://github.com/Amarchuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-07T18:14:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/625729357","html_url":"https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1155#issuecomment-625729357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1155","id":625729357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTcyOTM1Nw==","user":{"login":"Amarchuk","id":1048312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDgzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1048312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk","html_url":"https://github.com/Amarchuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amarchuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T09:30:33Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T09:30:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@GuillaumeDSM
