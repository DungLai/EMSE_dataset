To activate a websocket on an exchange, OctoBot needs to have the exchange websocket module installed. For now there is no websocket available. We are developing Binance websocket, we hope it will be available soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/comments/821133104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://github.com/Herklos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4604527087,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYwNDUyNzA4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/4604527087","actor":{"login":"edebie","id":14147087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQ3MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14147087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie","html_url":"https://github.com/edebie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-16T12:15:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4604527093,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MDQ1MjcwOTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/4604527093","actor":{"login":"edebie","id":14147087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQ3MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14147087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie","html_url":"https://github.com/edebie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edebie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-16T12:15:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4604527096,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYwNDUyNzA5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/4604527096","actor":{"login":"dbstraffin","id":15882893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODgyODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15882893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin","html_url":"https://github.com/dbstraffin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbstraffin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-16T12:15:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4604527102,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MDQ1MjcxMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/events/4604527102","actor":{"login":"dbstraffin","id":15882893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODgyODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatar
