is not a feature request and more like a question. I check all the docs and try to find examples, but still not sure about. My usecase is simple to formulate: I have a portfolio with some weights (for example [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0]) and on each step I have new prediction of the weights and thus need to sell/buy several pairs to rebalance according to prediction. Previously I did this manually calculating limit prices and tradable amount and it works more or less correctly. And I try to understand if it possible to develop such approach here, because `Octobot` looks superuseful and web-interface is especially fun to work with. \r\n\r\nIf I can read a specific code part - link is appreciated.
