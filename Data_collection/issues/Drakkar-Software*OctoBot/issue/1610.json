A 0 risk bot is very pessimistic (regarding its orders creation) and does not expect big market moves.\r\n\r\nA high risk (closer to 1) will make OctoBot a very active and heavy trader. A 1 risk bot is very optimistic (regarding its orders creation) and is expecting significative market moves\"\r\n\r\nThere's a smart way to make \"Risk\" settings more efficient and it's called \"Fear and Greed Index\" imo which looks very tight to the above description.\r\n\r\nHow it should work?\r\nYou add a button under \"Risk\" parameter to allow or not this feature.\r\n\r\nIf feature is allowed, you set anyway a max base parameter for your Risk (it means you accept Risk anycase up to your setting)\r\n\r\nWith this feature ON, the risk factor is multiplied by Fear and Greed index %. \r\nhttps://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/\r\n\r\nYou can see that % is expressed from 1 to 100. That mean that an index of 66% (like now) should be applied to your Risk settings as well if you allow this feature ON.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nI set default max Risk to 0.5. \r\n\r\nIf index from the website is 66%, then the 0.5 is multiplied by 0.66 and so tweaked down to 0.33 (as looking it in the opposite way it's a -34% less risk should being considered).\r\n\r\nAnother way to implement this fear and greed index is in the daily trade mode like for other social indicators, but imo the best way is the aforementioned.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1610/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1610/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
