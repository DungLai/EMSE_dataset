Once I installed OctoBot from the webpage. The terminal returned the erorr as following. Actually I could find binary file \"OctoBot\" in my directory. Then I tried `chmod +x OctoBot` but it didn't work and returned the error \"exec format error: ./OctoBot\". Then I tried to get the url of the binary file download the binary file manually. However, the file I downloaded from the web is named as OctoBot_linux, so I guessed that  you had wrongly uploaded the binary file which is built on Linux OS not on Mac OS. If you have any idea about this please let me know. Thank you very much!\r\n\r\nERROR:launcher:Exception on /bot [GET]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"flask/app.py\", line 2446, in wsgi_app\r\n  File \"flask/app.py\", line 1951, in full_dispatch_request\r\n  File \"flask/app.py\", line 1820, in handle_user_exception\r\n  File \"flask/_compat.py\", line 39, in reraise\r\n  File \"flask/app.py\", line 1949, in full_dispatch_request\r\n  File \"flask/app.py\", line 1935, in dispatch_request\r\n  File \"/Users/hourui/Downloads/octo/launcher/app/app_controller.py\", line 39, in bot\r\n    local_version = OctoBotVersion().get_current_version()\r\n  File \"/Users/hourui/Downloads/octo/launcher/tools/version.py\", line 83, in get_current_version\r\n    return executor.execute_command_on_current_binary(binary_path, [\"--version\"]).split(\"\\r\\n\")[0]\r\n  File \"/Users/hourui/Downloads/octo/launcher/tools/executor.py\", line 26, in execute_command_on_current_binary\r\n    return subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE).stdout.read().rstrip().decode()\r\n  File \"subprocess.py\", line 775, in __init__\r\n  File \"subprocess.py\", line 1522, in _execute_child\r\nOSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error: './OctoBot'\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Herklos","id":10454670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos","html_url":"https://github.com/Herklos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Herklos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
