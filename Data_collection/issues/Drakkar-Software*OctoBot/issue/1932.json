Additionally, other trigger bots may use  mixed case, like \"Sell\" or \"Buy\".  I was thinking it was good to possibly change the octobot_commons.configuration class to normalize the parsed configuration values to the case. .upper() or .lower().  No need to change the KEY, but the value might be good.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nease integration by normalizing config and match data.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nnone others really.  Its just what I generally do to ensure consistency.  Force parsed values to lowercase, it allows me to be more forgiving when I receive while still being strict while sending.  \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n- You can link a github gist to explain the feature\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
