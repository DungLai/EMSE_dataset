Please describe.**\r\nI can't access history of how the portfolio trades previously, only check the latest overall result. Maybe I am not aware enough and this is already available somewhere. Knowing this is important because you can see how well trading goes previously (are there many small trades or just one very successful, or maybe some event disrupt the performance).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIdeally it should be a button which lead to a `plotly` chart with portfolio amount over the time and maybe how individual coins contribute to it (for example as in `Color Palette for Bar Chart` example [here](https://plotly.com/python/horizontal-bar-charts/)). \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe only alternative right now as I know (talking about `0.3.9`) is to parse the logs for portfolio info.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI just want to mention another additional small improvement: it will be nice to add in piechart on `/portfolio` info in hover about percentage (so it will be like: DASH: 0.194483759983 (35.67%)). Obviously you can read this visually from the piechart itself, but it is not always easy and convenient.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1244/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
