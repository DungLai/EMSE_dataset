Please describe.**\r\nSo when running Octobot in simulation mode you are able to see red/green dots on the histogram where the bot did some trades. However, it would be very useful to mark when the bot detected a trading opportunity and it did not because of not enough funds.\r\n\r\nThis will help traders to find the right strategy and to understand why octobot is not performing. There is a difference between not having enough money and a bad strategy, currently, there is no way to know it without reading the logs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nPut a green/red X or triangle where the trading opportunity happened.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1902/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1902/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
