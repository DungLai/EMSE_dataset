Create a copy of `InstantMAEvaluator`, call it `MyOwnInstantMAEvaluator` and file containing it `simple_evaluator.py`\r\n  2. add tentacle info in the top of this file, like\r\n```python\r\n\"\"\"\r\nOctoBot Tentacle\r\n\r\n$tentacle_description: {\r\n    \"name\": \"MyOwnInstantMAEvaluator\",\r\n    \"type\": \"Evaluator\",\r\n    \"subtype\": \"REAL_TIME\",\r\n    \"version\": \"1.1.2\",\r\n    \"requirements\": [],\r\n    \"config_files\": [],\r\n    \"config_schema_files\": [],\r\n    \"tests\":[]\r\n}\r\n\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n  3. Paste it into `OctoBot-Tentacles/tentacles/Evaluator/RealTime/Advanced/simple_evaluator.py` and add the line `from .simple_evaluator import *` to __init__.py\r\n  4. Try to launch `Octobot` using ./launcher_app_linux, then click start octobot button and see that it can't starts because can't import this new evaluator\r\n  5. I also try to use Automated installation - put a line with path to `simple_evaluator.py` into OctoBot-Tentacles/user/config.json and in `OctoBot` try to use `start.py` to install it (not sure how main `OctoBot` repository can know where `OctoBot-Tentacles` located).\r\n  \r\n### Observed Results:\r\n\r\n  * What happened?\r\n\r\nThere are variety of errors, but in manual installation they all can be summarized by `Octobot` unable to import dependencies properly, like (relevant to InstantMAEvaluator code) `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'octobot_commons'`. If I just simply remove all dependencies of octobot_commons in my simple_evaluator.py and try again, I still can't do this is because `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'octobot_evaluators'`.\r\n\r\nIn automated for `python3.7 start.py -p install simple_evaluator` prompt says `OctoBot requires OctoBot-Tentacles-Manager, you can install it using python3 -m pip install -U OctoBot-Tentacles-Manager`, after `OctoBot-Tentacles-Manager` installation - \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"start.py\", line 21, in <module>\r\n    from octobot.commands import exchange_keys_encrypter, start_strategy_optimizer, start_bot, data_collector, \\\r\n  File \"/mnt/sdb2/octobot/OctoBot/octobot/commands.py\", line 35, in <module>\r\n    from octobot.logger import init_logger\r\n  File \"/mnt/sdb2/octobot/OctoBot/octobot/logger.py\", line 23, in <module>\r\n    from octobot_channels.channels.channel import get_chan\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'octobot_channels'\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe I miss something important and just done it all in a wrong way.\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nP.S. I also want to mention that wiki page I refer to contains `Examples with the tentacles created in the **Module creation** section:`.
