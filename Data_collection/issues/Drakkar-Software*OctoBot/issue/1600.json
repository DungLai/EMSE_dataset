Therefore no order are created by OctoBot. Inside the exchange platform or in the Kraken app there are no open orders, all cryptos are available for trading. Event logs aren't showing any errors.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter synchronization of portfolio the available funds should be not locked in OctoBot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Configure Kraken as Exchange\r\n2. Fetch Portfolio\r\n3. If Telegram or Web instance available check the portfolio status.\r\n  \r\n![octobot_krk_scrn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16022841/111366661-78860000-869c-11eb-8fe7-4ed358664e6a.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/issues/1600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
