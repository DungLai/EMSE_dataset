There, I am having a very similar problem installing as this closed issue but slightly different and the solution doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a screenshot because the prompt closes moments after giving the message.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that no folders appear to have been created for OctoBot so I have no idea where to put config.json file, I tried creating the  Appdata/Temp/etc/etc path and adding it there and also creating an OctoBot folder in program files and adding it there but neither helped.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot
