To fix this, please, put the \r\n```\r\nl_bert.apply_adapter_freeze()\r\n```\r\nonly once the model has been build (i.e. after the `model.build()`, which would instantiate the properly sized weights).\r\n\r\nAnd as a side note - usually `adapter_size` does not have to be too big. Depending on the task as small as 4 or 8 could be sufficient, and sometimes even without an adapter, freezing all of bert and tweaking only the layer_normalization layers could work surprisingly well.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/546931322/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2748372731,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc0ODM3MjczMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2748372731","actor":{"login":"tom-schoener","id":6278665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzg2NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6278665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener","html_url":"https://github.com/tom-schoener","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-28T12:50:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2748372733,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NDgzNzI3MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2748372733","actor":{"login":"tom-schoener","id":6278665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzg2NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6278665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener","html_url":"https://github.com/tom-schoener","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-schoener/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-28T12:50:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2750290657,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc1MDI5MDY1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2750290657","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-28T22:40:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/547187549","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/14#issuecomment-547187549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/14","id":547187549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ2

you for the quick response. The problem with the number of trainable weights being 0 was just a copy-paste error for the code example. \r\nI tried your suggested adapter_size of 4 and it works quite well for my task. Also, freezing all layers and only tweaking the normalization layers sounds interesting.
