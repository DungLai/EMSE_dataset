Hey, \r\nTraining loss does not drop over time and neither the validation loss. About parameters I have changed them alot. Like tried different number of layers, filters, regularization parameters etc but to no avail. \r\nBut I think the problem was something else. My data is in Urdu Language and it has got 10k samples of 3 classes with 50(Positive), 30(Negative) and 20(Neutral) percent distribution. I tried the same model on imdb data and it worked well. \r\nBut one tweak that remains is,\r\nHow does bert handles unknown words. Does it assign all of them to '[UNK]' and then learns them while training or is there some other technique ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/570462730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"muhammadfahid51","id":57350797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzUwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57350797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammadfahid51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2919406048,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkxOTQwNjA0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2919406048","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-03T04:58:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2919406050,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MTk0MDYwNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2919406050","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-03T04:58:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/570519580","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/33#issuecomment-570519580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/33","id":570519580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDUxOTU4MA==","user":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T09:41:57Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T09:41:57Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@muhammadfahid51 - I believe the BERT models were pre-trained on English only. So until there is a multilingual pre-trained model you might have to pre-train from scratch yourself. To check how the tokenization works with your language, you could tokenize and convert the tokens to ids, and then back. \r\nCurrently bert-for-tf2 does not have an example/tools for pre-training from scratch. When pre-training from scratch it might be easier using the workflow from the original google-research/bert. Once you have the pre-trained weights, you could fine-tune with bert-for-tf2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/570519580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2919769543,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkxOTc2OTU0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2919769543","actor":{"login":"muhammadfahid51","id":57350797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzUwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57350797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammadfahid51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-03T09:41:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2919769546,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MTk3Njk1NDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2919769546","actor":{"login":"muhammadfahid51","id":57350797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzUwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57350797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammadfahid51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-03T09:41:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2923769611,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkyMzc2OTYxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2923769611","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-06T10:30:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
