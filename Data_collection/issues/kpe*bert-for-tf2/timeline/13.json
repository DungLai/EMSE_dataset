This would not be much different than the fine-tuning usually done with BERT. \r\nCurrently bert-for-tf's does not include the final [dense classification layers](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/cc7051dc592802f501e8a6f71f8fb3cf9de95dc9/run_pretraining.py#L249) used in the MLM pre-training task (so they have to be added explicitly in the Keras `Model`). And if you want to reuse the original weights for those [classification](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/cc7051dc592802f501e8a6f71f8fb3cf9de95dc9/run_pretraining.py#L290) [layers](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/cc7051dc592802f501e8a6f71f8fb3cf9de95dc9/run_pretraining.py#L245) you might have to manually load the weights or carefully name them (by using the exact same names used in the pre-trained checkpoint). \r\nBut, I guess, it should be better, if I add a config parameter controlling the instantiation of the `cls/` layers, so that the weights from the pre-trained checkpoint are loaded automatically.\r\nGood point, Thank you,
