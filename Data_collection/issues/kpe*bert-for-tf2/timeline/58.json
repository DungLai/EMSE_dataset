I created two new simpler examples and both use GlobalAveragePooling like above. Then explain to me why one works, and the other doesn't? See below the simplified examples. First example uses an LSTM which is then passed to a GlobalAvgPooling layer. Second example uses bert. \r\n\r\n\r\n`    \r\n//-----------------------WORKS-------------------------------------------//\r\ndef example_1(bert_config_file=None, bert_ckpt_file=None):\r\n\twith tf.io.gfile.GFile(bert_config_file, \"r\") as reader:\r\n\t\tbert_params = params_from_pretrained_ckpt(bert_ckpt_file)\r\n\t\tl_bert = BertModelLayer.from_params(bert_params, name=\"bert\")\r\n\r\n\tin_sentence = Input(shape=(128,), dtype='int64', name=\"Input1\")\r\n\tembedded_sentence = Embedding(1000, 300, trainable=False)(in_sentence)\r\n\tlstm_sentence = LSTM(300, return_sequences=True)(embedded_sentence)\r\n\tbert_output = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(lstm_sentence)\r\n\r\n\tsentence_model = Model(in_sentence, bert_output)\r\n\r\n\tsection_input = Input(shape=(None, None), dtype='int64', name=\"Input2\")\r\n\tsection_encoded = TimeDistributed(sentence_model)(section_input)\r\n\tsection_encoded = LSTM(300)(section_encoded)\r\n\tsection_encoded = Dense(21)(section_encoded)\r\n\tsection_model = Model(section_input, section_encoded)\r\n\r\n\tsection_model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   loss=\"binary_crossentropy\")\r\n\r\n\tsentence_model.summary()\r\n\tsection_model.summary()\r\n\r\n\treturn section_model\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n//-----------------------------DOES NOT WORK-------------------------------//\r\n\r\n def example_2(bert_config_file=None, bert_ckpt_file=None):\r\n\twith tf.io.gfile.GFile(bert_config_file, \"r\") as reader:\r\n\t\tbert_params = params_from_pretrained_ckpt(bert_ckpt_file)\r\n\t\tl_bert = BertModelLayer.from_params(bert_params, name=\"bert\")\r\n\r\n\tin_sentence = Input(shape=(128,), dtype='int64', name=\"Input1\")\r\n\tbert_output = l_bert(in_sentence)\r\n\tbert_output = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(bert_output)\r\n\r\n\tsentence_model = Model(in_sentence, bert_output)\r\n\r\n\tsection_input = Input(shape=(None, None), dtype='int64', name=\"Input2\")\r\n\tsection_encoded = TimeDistributed(sentence_model)(section_input)\r\n\tsection_encoded = LSTM(300)(section_encoded)\r\n\tsection_encoded = Dense(21)(section_encoded)\r\n\tsection_model = Model(section_input, section_encoded)\r\n\r\n\tsection_model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   loss=\"binary_crossentropy\")\r\n\r\n\tsentence_model.summary()\r\n\tsection_model.summary()\r\n\r\n\treturn section_model`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/615266128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nectario","id":22030060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDMwMDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22030060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario","html_url":"https://github.com/nectario","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nectario/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/615278172","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/58#issuecomment-615278172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/58","id":615278172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTI3ODE3Mg==","user":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-17T14:32:26Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T14:32:26Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"have you tried instrumenting your code with the two print statements above?

build/compiled.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/615332072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/615333599","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/58#issuecomment-615333599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/58","id":615333599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTMzMzU5OQ==","user":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-17T16:12:15Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T16:12:15Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"ok,
