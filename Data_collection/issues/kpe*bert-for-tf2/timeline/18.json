It's kind of Keras black magic happening behind the scenes :-) (... like it is so often the case in keras)\r\nIf you know a case, where this is not set properly, let me know! \r\n(This might for example be the case, if you call your layer directly - but as long keras is doing the call, keras will try to find the proper `kargs` for the `call()`)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/551960240/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2784306499,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc4NDMwNjQ5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2784306499","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-08T19:30:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2784306510,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc4NDMwNjUxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2784306510","actor":{"login":"jonathanbratt","id":33073024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDczMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33073024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanbratt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-08T19:30:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2784306511,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3ODQzMDY1MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2784306511","actor":{"login":"jonathanbratt","id":33073024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDczMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33073024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanbratt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanbratt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-08T19:30:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
