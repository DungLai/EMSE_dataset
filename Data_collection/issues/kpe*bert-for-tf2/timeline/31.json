This however only makes sense when you fine-tune your BERT layer on the task of interest. As an alternative you could freeze the BERT weights, and feed the BERT token representations in a followup model. I'm not aware of any outstanding benefits of the later approach however.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/570232893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2917929473,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkxNzkyOTQ3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2917929473","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-02T15:01:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2917929478,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkxNzkyOTQ3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2917929478","actor":{"login":"muhammadfahid51","id":57350797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzUwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57350797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammadfahid51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-02T15:01:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2917929481,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MTc5Mjk0ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2917929481","actor":{"login":"muhammadfahid51","id":57350797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzUwNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57350797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammadfahid51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammadfahid51/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-02T15:01:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
