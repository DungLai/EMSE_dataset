This is only possible once the shape of the input is known. So usually, this would be done by calling `Model.build()` in Keras. You could only explicitly do a dummy call to your layer, which would also instantiate the weights:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nl_bert(tf.zeros(1, 128)) \r\nbert.load_bert_weights(l_bert, model_ckpt)  \r\n```\r\na minimal example with `Model.build()` would be:\r\n```python\r\nmodel = tf.keras.models.Sequential([l_bert])\r\nmodel.build((1,128))\r\nl_bert.load_bert_weights(l_bert, model_ckpt)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/555416047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2810656226,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgxMDY1NjIyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2810656226","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-19T09:34:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2810656242,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgxMDY1NjI0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2810656242","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-19T09:34:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2810656243,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4MTA2NTYyNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2810656243","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-19T09:34:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T10:59:54Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T10:59:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/25","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/25/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/25/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/25/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/25","id":530754800,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MzA3NTQ4MDA=","number":25,"title":"Can't
