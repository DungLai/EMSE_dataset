Which albert code exactly are you referring to? \r\nPlease note, while the google's bert pre-trained models use a vocab_size of 30522 and a custom tokenizer, the albert pre-trained models from tfhub use a vocab_size of 30000 and sentencepice as tokenizer. \r\n\r\nSo, when using some of the pre-trained albert models, the model input should be prepared/tokenized differently. \r\n\r\nIt seems, I currently have no example of how tokenization should be best done for albert, so I'll have to add one! Thank you for noticing this!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/comments/552547408/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2788803183,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc4ODgwMzE4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2788803183","actor":{"login":"mshlis","id":54729819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzI5ODE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54729819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis","html_url":"https://github.com/mshlis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T17:56:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2788803184,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3ODg4MDMxODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2788803184","actor":{"login":"mshlis","id":54729819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzI5ODE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54729819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis","html_url":"https://github.com/mshlis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshlis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T17:56:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2788803407,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNzg4ODAzNDA3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kpe/bert-for-tf2/issues/events/2788803407","actor":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T17:56:55Z","assignee":{"login":"kpe","id":2535923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzU5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe","html_url":"https://github.com/kpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com
