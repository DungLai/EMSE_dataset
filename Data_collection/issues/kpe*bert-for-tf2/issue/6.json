I want to use tensorflow with gpu support so I first run `pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14`. Running `tensorflow.test.is_gpu_available()` returns True and all works.\r\n\r\nI then run `pip install bert-for-tf2` and in the process of installing the requirements, params-flow has a requirement of tensorflow, so tensorflow==1.14 gets installed at this time. Now when running 'tensorflow.test.is_gpu_available()` False is returned. Both tensorflow and tensorflow-gpu are in the conda environment.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what is the proper way to deal with this inconsistency, but the way I got around it was to first install tensorflow-gpu. Then clone the repo for params-flow, remove tensorflow from it's requirements and then install with `python setup.py install` from within the repo. Finally bert-for-tf2 can be installed with pip and all seems to work. \r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\n\r\nJust read one of the closed issues, and things seem to work if bert-for-tf2 is installed first and then a gpu version of tensorflow is installed afterwards.
