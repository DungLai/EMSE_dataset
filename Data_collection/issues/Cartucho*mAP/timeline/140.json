Just to clarify, I seem not able to find the source that says it is our responsibility to filter the boxes before evaluation. I looked at the PASCAL VOC paper https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/postscript/ijcv_voc09.pdf but not able to find it, could you point out the source by any chance?\r\n\r\nAs I start to understand the mAP definition, I see people are computing mAP, setting the confidence threshold 0. This is because mAP is computed using the data points from the lowest confidence values to highest confidence values by setting the confidence threshold to 0 (which means technically detected target of confidence value 0 will be included in the mAP evaluation as well as confidence value of 1.0). Therefore, I wonder if it is logical to set a confidence threshold for reporting numbers, in my case 0.25 instead of 0, and mAP is computed using the data points above 0.25 to the highest confidence value at the detected target. Note that 0.25 is set for other purposes (for object tracking).

@takehiro-code , you're right. It's in the Documentation of the VOC2007 (probably also in 2012) [Devkit](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/devkit_doc_07-Jun-2007.pdf). There, in the evaluation section of the detection task, it says that \"it is the responsibility of the participant’s system to filter multiple detections from its output.\" This usually the NMS part where you set your own IoU threshold.\r\n\r\nWhen I evaluated Tiny YOLOv2 on VOC2007 I achieved the best result ~55% mAP with a confidence threshold of 0.005. However, this is utterly useless in practice because it results in many many False Positives. I guess this works because Recall does not consider False Positives. I wonder, however, if mAP is a good measure when the best results are achieved with totally impractical detections. When actually running my system I use a confidence threshold of 0.25. When evaluated this yielded around 33% mAP.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/854412726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"janedoesrepo","id":20143191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTQzMTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20143191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo","html_url":"https://github.com/janedoesrepo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janedoesrepo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4841426659,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDg0MTQyNjY1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/events/4841426659","actor":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T06:54:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4841426660,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ4NDE0MjY2NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/events/4841426660","actor":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T06:54:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/855528288","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/issues/140#issuecomment-855528288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/140","id":855528288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTUyODI4OA==","user":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-07T0
