I.e. ground truth boxes without predictions overlapping will not be shown?\r\n\r\nThe animation is currently showing the predictions (in green or red) and correspondent ground-truth (in blue) if exists. When you calculate the AP you iterate through the ranked predictions.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15831541/39083237-8d7c505e-4559-11e8-8cb7-d269e1c660ca.png)\r\n\r\nDo you think it would be useful to also show in the animation the ground-truth instances that were not used?\r\nI think a great feature would be for the people to be able to see the animation, step by step while calculating the AP for each class. e.g. it would plot and show the respective image at each time. This would help people understand what is going on. \r\n\r\n> Does the row order of objects in the prediction files matter? Example for Image A, the ground truth has 3 cars and the row order of the cars in the ground truth file is sorted by xmin in ascending order. However, the prediction is ordered by car 2, car 1 and then car 3.\r\n\r\nThe predictions will be automatically sorted by their confidence. So you do not need to worry about it. Actually, if you check the images in `results/images` you should be able to see it for yourself :grinning: \r\nBtw, you also gave me another idea. Adding to the images the ranking information of each prediction.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/383284915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/383286720","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/issues/14#issuecomment-383286720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/14","id":383286720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzI4NjcyMA==","user":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-21T11:21:51Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T11:21:51Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I
