Hi, that's good job. I have confused that how to get ground-truth and detection result txt file? Does there provide script so that I could directly use to convert my ground truth label? I use KITTI vehicle data to evaluate yolov3 performance. The format of label records coordinate of all ground-truth bbox together, but I don't know how to separate them.\r\n> And how can I convert test result to the format of detection-result.txt, just like the file in your repos? Could you please help me？\r\n> \r\n> Thanks a lot in advance!\r\n\r\nHi guys, I will give it a try and hope that I don't confuse you all.\r\n\r\nIf you have not already seen Cartucho's OpenLabeling tool, please go here: https://github.com/Cartucho/OpenLabeling\r\n\r\nStep1: The method I created detect-results text format files required for the mAP script, was to use OpenLabel script call main_auto.py script. Once I made this work and use my frozen inference model, I copied the script with a different name \"main_auto_map.py\" and added confidence list/numpy arrays to the functions where it creates the XML files.\r\n\r\nStep 2: In this folder: https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/tree/master/scripts/extra there is script to create XML to txt files for your ground truths. What I did is copy this script \"convert_gt_xml.py\" and name it \"convert_dt_xml.py\" because the scripts need to read the confidence level tag you add from step 1 script. This will create your required text files for the mAP.\r\n\r\nI hope that this answers your question.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/540856417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"6monkeyrs","id":25964240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTY0MjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25964240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs","html_url":"https://github.com/6monkeyrs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/6monkeyrs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
