first of all, I recommend you to see this video:\r\n[mean Average Precision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM6DJ0ZZee0)\r\n\r\nBasically, the mAP is a single-number metric used to evaluate **rankings**.\r\nWell, this is great for object recognition detectors since the predictions are associated with a confidence level and allows us to rank these predictions from higher to lower confidence and then get the mAP value.\r\n\r\nIn practice the higher the confidence of a detection (from 0% to 100%) the more important it will be. Specifically what happens at rank 1 is twice as important as what happens at rank 2. So it tells how good is your detector taking into account the confidence for each prediction.\r\n\r\nThe AP is calculated by the area (shown in `blue`) of each of the plots above. Each of the points in that graph correspond to a prediction and they are ordered by confidence. These points go down when there is a false detection and up when there is a true detection. In the gaph of the left the blue dot didn't go down 33 times (corresponding to the true detections) and in the graph of the right 32 times.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the left plot the false predictions are all concentrated in the end and probably associated with low confidence levels, meaning that in terms of mAP you have a very good model. In this case if you find the right threshold for this class that will remove those last points in the end (try for example a threshold of 0.1) you can even get a higher AP. If you get creative you can even find the right threshold for each class.\r\n\r\n>  Are there any other way to evaluate object detection task ?\r\n\r\nmAP is the standard metric used in the research papers. Your model seems to be working very well (in fact it even seems too good to be true). You can also have a look at other metrics like ROC curve.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/383613952/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1589445945,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1ODk0NDU5NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/events/1589445945","actor":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-23T15:24:52Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/383625452","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/issues/16#issuecomment-383625452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/16","id":383625452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzYyNTQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"andikira","id":37479922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDc5OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37479922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira","html_url":"https://github.com/andikira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-23T15:52:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T15:52:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a great explanation, now i have more good intuition about mAP\r\n\r\n`In this case if you find the right threshold for this class that will remove those last points in the end (try for example a threshold of 0.1) you can even get a higher AP.
