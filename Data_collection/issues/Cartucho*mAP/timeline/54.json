And make sure that the test and training set are completely independent and the pictures have been taken in different days/circumstances.\r\n\r\nSecondly, since the mAP is a ranked metric usually when you decrease the threshold you will get a larger mAP score but that comes with the cost of having more `False Positives` (object detected but does not match ground-truth). Of course if your threshold is too high then you get more `False Negatives` (object not detected but it is in the ground-truth). So that really depends if you want to maximize `Precision` (What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?) or `Recall` (What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?).\r\n\r\nI am currently not plotting the False Negatives but I will add that feature so that people can visualise this tradeoff.\r\n\r\nAlso, have a look at the log-average miss ratio score (you should see a plot in the `results/` folder), many people use it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/458904880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2192868747,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5Mjg2ODc0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/events/2192868747","actor":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T05:20:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2192868748,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTI4Njg3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/events/2192868748","actor":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T05:20:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
