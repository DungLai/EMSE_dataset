sorry for I didn't get back to you earlier.

So I dug through my code to discover that I had collected the predictions at a threshold of 0.05 which is super low and hence it literally outputted a lot of classes, giving such high values for the MAP. However, thinking about the MAP's formula, shouldn't low threshold increase false positives as well? Does that not impact a lot on its value? If low threshold gives a good MAP value, then is MAP really a good measure for object detection! Am I missing something?
