If the class is correct and the IOU > 0.5 then you have a true positive (a \"MATCH!\") and that ground-truth object is marked as used.\r\n\r\nSince there can only be one detection for each ground-truth object the following ones (with lower confidence score) even if they are correct they will be marked as a False Positive since it is a \"REPEATED MATCH!\".
