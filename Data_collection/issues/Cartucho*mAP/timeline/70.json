I'm having a problem where even if I copy my detection results directly from the ground truth (adding a confidence score of 1.0), certain bounding boxes give an AP of 0 and bring down the mAP unnecessarily.\r\n> \r\n> For example, try adding `1.txt` to `detection-results` containing:\r\n> `dog 1.0 206 394 173 405`\r\n> and `1.txt` to `ground-truth` containing:\r\n> `dog 206 394 173
