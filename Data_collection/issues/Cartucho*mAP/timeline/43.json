You will now find a plot in the `results/` with the log-average miss rate for each class.\r\n\r\nGreat work! Thanks a lot! While I might have spotted two small bugs: \r\n\r\n**Line 651**: you calculate your lamr after map, but in your function 'voc_ap', you've changed the variable 'rec' and 'prec' by insert values at the beginning and end of your two lists. \r\n\r\n**Line 88**: miss rate is 1-recall instead of 1-precision. [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall): FNR=1-TPR.\r\n\r\nAnd I have a small question please: I've checked the version Matlab (https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox/blob/master/detector/acfTest.m), and you have done the same things by calculating mr with miss=exp(mean(log(max(1e-10,1-miss)))). But in the paper, It is \"averaging miss rate at nine FPPI rates evenly spaced in log-space\". Why not use the average?\r\n\r\nWaiting for your answer

Have you ever checked if your result is identical with the MATLAB function 'evaluateDetectionMissRate'? I've quickly built two small scripts for the format convert and Matlab evaluation. I don't have Matlab installed, could you verify if they gave the same result?\r\n\r\n'convert_for_matlab.py' to convert .txt files in 'ground-truth' and 'predicted' to .mat.\r\n'lamr.m' read these .mat files to calculate miss rate with the Matlab 'evaluateDetectionMissRate' function. (before running, change work dir to 'matlab/')\r\n\r\nMay exits bugs, cause I can't debug without Matlab..\r\nRename these scripts before running plz, it seems that I can't upload .py and .m files :(\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n[convert_for_matlab.py.txt](https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/files/2851126/convert_for_matlab.py.txt)\r\n[lamr.m.txt](https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/files/2851127/lamr.m.txt)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/462320845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhanghengdev","id":22428320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDI4MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22428320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghengdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghengdev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/462748721","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/issues/43#issuecomment-462748721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/43","id":462748721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mjc0ODcyMQ==","user":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-12T12:56:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T12:56:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@ZHANGHeng19931123 sure, thank you for those scripts, I will check it out!\r\n\r\nI can only work on this next week because this one I'm very busy!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/462748721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
