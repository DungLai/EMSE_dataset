The metric mAP is computed based on the average of all object classes and IOU threshold at 0.5. However, if you want to evaluate based on _COCO challenge_, mAP will be computed based on the average of all object classes AND average of 10 IOU thresholds of 0.5 to 0.95. I think modification of mAP definition to COCO challenge may be necessary, which I hope as a new feature or enhancement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/849395056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/897937357","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP/issues/113#issuecomment-897937357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/113","id":897937357,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB2npQM41hW_N","user":{"login":"Ash-Chump2Champ","id":76086281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDg2Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76086281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ","html_url":"https://github.com/Ash-Chump2Champ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-12T20:14:06Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T20:14:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi so I am using that script to convert YOLO to our format:\r\nI would like to ask, do I need to use the .cfg file for training or testing?\r\n# Testing\r\nbatch=1\r\nsubdivisions=1\r\n# Training\r\n#batch=64\r\n#subdivisions=16","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/comments/897937357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ash-Chump2Champ","id":76086281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDg2Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76086281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ","html_url":"https://github.com/Ash-Chump2Champ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ash-Chump2Champ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
