Why is there a linear segment in the graph stretching from 0.65 Recall to 1 Recall? I see the same thing when I test my own results. It looks like no points are being plotted after 0.65 Recall and that a linear line is drawn from the last plotted point to the intercept (1,0). \r\n\r\nI previously thought that the curve was produced by plotting precision vs recall as our confidence threshold was decreased until 0. I.e. As 0 confidence corresponds to 1 recall, I would expect to see plotted points along the x-axis up until the point that recall reaches 1. If you have any insight into how I might be misunderstanding this, I would be interested in hearing your thoughts.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35053174/42958105-44fd8442-8b4a-11e8-9f74-d849048afa66.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Cartucho","id":15831541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15831541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho","html_url":"https://github.com/Cartucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cartucho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
