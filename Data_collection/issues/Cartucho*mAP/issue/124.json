Two of them resulted in AP values greater than 0.5, but the AP of the other ones is 0.0. The ground-truth and results files are correct, and the coordinates of the boxes seem to be correct for all classes. No difficulty was assigned to any class. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/124/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
