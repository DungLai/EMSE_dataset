But it gives the mAP of 45.74% only. I didnt change any files in your code. Both AlexeyAB implementation and yours kept the IOU-Threshold of 0.5 but gives different result for AP@50 even in each classes.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
