I have confused that how to get ground-truth and detection result txt file? Does there provide script so that I could directly use to convert my ground truth label? I use  KITTI vehicle data to evaluate yolov3 performance. The format of label records coordinate of all ground-truth bbox together, but I don't know how to separate them. \r\nAnd how can I convert test result to the format of detection-result.txt, just like the file in your repos?  Could you please help meï¼Ÿ\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/89/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/89/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
