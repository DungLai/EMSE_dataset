I.e. ground truth boxes without predictions overlapping will not be shown?\r\n\r\nDoes the row order of objects in the prediction files matter?  Example for Image A, the ground truth has 3 cars and the row order of the cars in the ground truth file is sorted by xmin in ascending order.  However, the prediction is ordered by car 2, car 1 and then car 3.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nLobbie  ","closed_by":{"login":"lobbie","id":7201704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDE3MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7201704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie","html_url":"https://github.com/lobbie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lobbie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
