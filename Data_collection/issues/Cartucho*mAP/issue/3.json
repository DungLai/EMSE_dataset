The result of test data prediction is .json file format like this (to fill in predicted folder)\r\n \r\n[{\"label\": \"RBC\", \"confidence\": 0.98, \"topleft\": {\"x\": 252, \"y\": 0}, \"bottomright\": {\"x\": 373, \"y\": 81}} . . . ]\r\n\r\nand annotation in .xml like this (to fill in ground-truth folder)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37479922/38103411-7ac3821c-33b0-11e8-93ba-05e7a7933020.png)\r\n\r\ni think information for ground-truth and predicted is enough for run in your repo but this form in different format. Do you have any suggestion how to convert both of that to match in your repo ? \r\n\r\nthanks in advance and sorry for my bad English ","closed_by":{"login":"andikira","id":37479922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDc5OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37479922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira","html_url":"https://github.com/andikira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andikira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
