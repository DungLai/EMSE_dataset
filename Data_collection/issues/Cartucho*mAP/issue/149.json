Unlike previously where we used to divide the recall to 11 equally spaced points?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
