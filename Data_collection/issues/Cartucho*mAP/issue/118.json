The main point here is the coordinates of the Bounding Box I am getting from Carla are in the world frame and if I am not wrong, the prediction.txt file has coordinates in the image frame, right? So do you have any idea how I could have coordinates in prediction.txt in the world frame instead of the image frame? I am trying to exclude the use of an image annotation tool to create Ground truth.\r\n\r\nFormat of GT I am creating: class min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y\r\n![coordinates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43422858/84708389-b4026b00-af60-11ea-83a0-36a03d63d3d3.png)\r\n\r\nDo you have any comments on this?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dev015","id":43422858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDIyODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43422858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015","html_url":"https://github.com/dev015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dev015/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
