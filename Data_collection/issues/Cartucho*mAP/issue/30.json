I've been looking for something to test the accuracy of my data.\r\n\r\nI trained and tested following AlexeyAB's step by step guide. Everything works well. But now when I go for testing using this repo I was curious about how to get confidence for the predicted object files. I see that in the extras folder there is a script to convert from YOLO to the predicted format but the way mine works is I run the command to test a single picture so how would that work trying to save for mAP? I think I need to have bounding boxes of predictions similar to my labels but am unsure of how to do this. Any help is appreciated.
