This repo is extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nI have few questions. Could you please help me.\r\nI have 1 class and predicted using tinyYolo\r\nQ1 ) How should we know which threshold is best to choose?\r\nat 0.1 Threshold I got mAP : 63.07% , lamr : 0.52 , FP : 3942 and TP 1460.\r\nat 0.3 Threshold mAP : 59.72% , lamr : 0.52 , FP : 861 and TP 1325.\r\nat 0.5 Threshold mAP : 52.24% , lamr : 0.57 , FP : 861 and TP 1121\r\n\r\nSo. Is there a way to find an optimal threshold at one go?\r\n\r\nQ2.) What is the difference between lamr and ROC? (I am not clear with both terms)\r\n\r\nQ3 ) Is there any difference between IOUThreshold and threshold?If so could you please explain.\r\n\r\nSorry. If the question look dumb or illogical.
