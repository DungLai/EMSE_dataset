However only true positive seems to matter when I run this code. Even when the false positive count goes down considerably, the mAP does not increase while if the true positive count goes a little higher up mAP increases a lot. Are you sure this is how it is supposed to work? Personally I do not think so. Is there any explanation for why this is happening?
