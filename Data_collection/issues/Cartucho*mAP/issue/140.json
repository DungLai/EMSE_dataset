I am using yolov3 detector with various confidence threshold and iou threshold and trying to get mAP for each detector configuration. My goal here is I am doing grid search of confidence threshold and iou threshold values based on maximizing mAP. My question here is should I set iou threshold value (default as `MINOVERLAP = 0.5`) same as the detector threshold? \r\n\r\nFor example, I run detector with iou threshold 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, then should the iou threshold be same accordingly as 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 in the variable `MINOVERLAP` or does it have to be 0.5 to evaluate the detector performance for various iou threshold.\r\n\r\nMy assumption here is I should stick with 0.5 since I am measuring the detector performance for various iou threshold but decreasing `MINOVERLAP` means mAP will be higher, which negate the meaning of assesing the performance on various detector iou threshold.","closed_by":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
