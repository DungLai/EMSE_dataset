My goal is to find the sweet spot to decrease my learning rate and continue with the training.\r\n\r\nI have been trying a few things out and here is what I got:\r\n\r\nstep 47 750, detection threshold of 0.5 gives me mAP of  18.95\r\nstep 47 750, detection threshold of 0.2 gives me mAP of  39.68\r\nstep 47 750, detection threshold of 0.1 gives me mAP of  44.71\r\nstep 47 750, detection threshold of 0.01 gives me mAP of  46.34\r\n\r\nstep 52 500, detection threshold of 0.5 gives me mAP of 31.73\r\nstep 52 500, detection threshold of 0.2 gives me mAP of 52.56\r\nstep 52 500, detection threshold of 0.1 gives me mAP of 56.18\r\nstep 52 500, detection threshold of 0.01 gives me mAP of 57.42\r\n\r\nMy conclusion here is that the model is still learning and I should keep going.\r\n\r\nMy question, what detection threshold should I be using ? Does it make a difference if my goal is only to evaluate one step to an other ? Should I keep calculating many of them like this ?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cartucho/mAP/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
