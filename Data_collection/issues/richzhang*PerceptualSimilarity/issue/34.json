Now, i am planning to use the generator network features[weights] to calculate PerceptualSimilarity score. I am not quite sure how to do this.\r\n\r\nIf i correctly understood, In either VGG/Resnet we will be passing the query images(image1, image2) through the network, for each input image we get all the features and calculate the score using them. \r\n\r\nBut i am not sure how to use that features for WGAN, since the input to the generator network is noise and the output is the synthetically generated images. How do i pass query images to get those features? \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"richzhang","id":18079594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDc5NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18079594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/richzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
