I would like to **see** which areas in the image contributed to higher LPIPS distance.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"gafniguy","id":37619828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjE5ODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37619828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy","html_url":"https://github.com/gafniguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gafniguy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
