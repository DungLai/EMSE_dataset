I would like to know if there is a smart way to use LPIPS metric for image retrieval, other than computing all the pairwise distances.\r\n\r\nFor information, my dataset of [game banners](https://github.com/woctezuma/download-steam-banners) contains about 30k images. In my previous experiments, I extracted image features **once**, and could then work with this processed data using standard tools for efficient similarity search based on cosine similarity, Minkowski distance, etc.\r\n\r\nThank your for your attention.","closed_by":{"login":"richzhang","id":18079594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDc5NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18079594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/richzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
