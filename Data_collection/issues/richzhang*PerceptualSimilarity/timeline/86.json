I should have read more carefully the other issues :)\r\n\r\nHere the computation in detail if somebody comes across this issue. Let us say we have a pixel in the R-channel with a pixel value of 240. I rescale it to [-1, 1] with 2 * 240/255 - 1 = 15/17. Then I normalize it with ScalingLayer and get (15/17 - -0.030)/0.458 = 1.99203. Regular VGG would do (240/255 - 0.485)/0.229 = 1.99203. So the normalization is indeed correct.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/comments/951356197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lars76","id":3878022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzgwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3878022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76","html_url":"https://github.com/lars76","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5516489534,"node_id":"CE_lADOBvnN_M49uF2izwAAAAFIzvM-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/events/5516489534","actor":{"login":"lars76","id":3878022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzgwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3878022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76","html_url":"https://github.com/lars76","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lars76/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-25T21:44:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/comments/1333384854","html_url":"https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/86#issuecomment-1333384854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/86","id":1333384854,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBvnN_M5PedaW","user":{"login":"98mxr","id":82786769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzg2NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82786769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr","html_url":"https://github.com/98mxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/98mxr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-01T08:20:33Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T08:20:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a small problem.
