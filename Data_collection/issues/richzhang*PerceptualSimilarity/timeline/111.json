Keep in mind that this won't mask the pixels out exactly, since the deep features have a receptive field. To truly mask out the pixels, you need to trace through the receptive fields of the deep activations like in https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Gatys_Controlling_Perceptual_Factors_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity/issues/comments/1276675151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"richzhang","id":18079594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDc5NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18079594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/richzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richzhang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
