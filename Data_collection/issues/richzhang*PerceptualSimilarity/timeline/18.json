still have issues understanding how the implementation matches the paper formula\r\n\r\nlets say we have the following example:\r\n````\r\na = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.2])\r\nb = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.6])\r\nw = np.array([1,1,1])\r\neps = 1e-10 \r\n````\r\n\r\nwe normalize the two inputs a and b:\r\n````\r\na_n = a / (np.sqrt(np.sum(a**2)) + eps)\r\nb_n = b / (np.sqrt(np.sum(b**2)) +
