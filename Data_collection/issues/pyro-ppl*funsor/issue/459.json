It would be nice if we can leverage the boolean mask to avoid some computations when `mask=False`. I guess in that case, we can return a zero Tensor with shapes are interpreted from the backend masked distribution.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
