We initially wanted to reuse their optimizer, but the assumptions it makes about the input contraction (particularly the assumption that any pair of terms or intermediate results can be contracted together) are not ideal for rewriting funsor sum-product expressions (#2 ) or may leave exploitable structure on the table.\r\n\r\nThis issue is for tracking the implementation of a new Funsor-specific sum-product optimizer.
