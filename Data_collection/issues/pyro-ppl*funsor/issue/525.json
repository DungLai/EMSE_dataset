These internal data structures complicate funsor traversal algorithms (e.g. `reinterpret`, `ast()`, `get_children()`), since the intermediate non-`Funsor` data structures lack metadata such as `.inputs`, `.output`, `.fresh`, `.bound`.  This complication manifests as extra checks for `isinstance(-, Funsor)` and extra handling to manually traverse funsor data asts.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes to replace all internal data structure of funsors by additional low-level Pythonic funsors `Tuple`, `Dict`, and `Set`.  Like other more mathy funsors, these data structural funsors implement metadata like `.inputs`, `.output`, substitution via `.__call__()` and reinterpreted construction and hash consing via `type(-).__call__()`.\r\n\r\nFor example `Subs.subs : Dict`, `Delta.terms : Dict`, etc.\r\n\r\n## Remaining questions\r\n\r\n1. Should we also implement `Funsor` subclasses for constants `Str` as used as keys? Ideally all terms would be immutable and hash-consed, however `str`s are used so ubiquitously as keys that it may not be worth the performance overhead.  One option would be to instead rely on Python's built-in hash-consing of strings via [sys.intern()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.intern) and move metadata elsewhere, as in #526\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement an immutable `Dict` funsor\r\n- [ ] Implement an immutable `Set` funsor\r\n- [ ] Use `Dict` and `Set` internally in other `Funsor`s\r\n- [ ] Simplify `funsor.interpreter`","closed_by":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
