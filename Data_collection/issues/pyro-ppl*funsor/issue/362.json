In the future I'd like to publish these somewhere in Funsor so they are available in both Pyro and NumPyro. For example I'd like to move Pyro's [HaarTransform](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/distributions.html#pyro.distributions.transforms.HaarTransform) into Funsor, unblocking `numpyro.contrib.epidemiology`.\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes reorganizing `funsor.ops` to contain all backend-generic low-level ops as follows:\r\n```\r\nfunsor/ops/__init__.py  # imports Op and basic ops\r\nfunsor/ops/op.py  # defines Op\r\nfunsor/ops/builtin.py  # defines basic ops like add, mul, etc\r\nfunsor/ops/array.py  # defines things like GetitemOp, cat, stack, reshape\r\nfunsor/ops/transforms.py  # defines Haar wavelets, DCT transform\r\nfunsor/ops/phylo.py  # defines phylogenetic likelihoods\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis module would be the main interface for ops, and the backend-specific modules like `funsor.torch.ops` would simply register implementations of those interfaces. We can organize `funsor.mybackend.ops` as either a monolithic module or as multiple submodules; it doesn't matter because it isn't an interface.\r\n\r\ncc @eb8680 @fehiepsi","closed_by":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/362/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
