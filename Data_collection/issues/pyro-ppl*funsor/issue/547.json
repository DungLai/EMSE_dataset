Examples are Zero terms in [`Delta.eager_reduce`](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/blob/e66bc6f6b5bc19d51e163666090bf22f6c0255d7/funsor/delta.py#L189) and In [`contrib.funsor.TraceEnum_ELBO`](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/45d6516170c865c28ceae6133f3f2f3b30c77b6f/pyro/contrib/funsor/infer/traceenum_elbo.py#L223). This is currently implemented as expanded Tensor terms which is memory/computation inefficient and only allows `Bint` input type. Proposed `Constant` funsor has following benefits: \r\n\r\n1. Declare constant inputs of a Funsor in a memory efficient way: e.g. `Constant(cost.inputs, Number(0))`\r\n2. Allow variables with `Real` output type: e.g. `Constant(OrderedDict(x=Bint[3], y=Real), Number(0))`\r\n3. Define computationally efficient patterns for `subs/reduce/unary/binary` operations\r\n4. Convert to and from `ProvenanceTensor` (#543) where provenance of the tensor corresponds to `const_inputs`. Edit: I donâ€™t think this is correct, the counterpart of `ProvenanceTensor` should something similar to `Delta`.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# Substitution\r\n\r\n# 0(x, y)\r\na = Constant(OrderedDict(x=Bint[3], y=Real), Number(0))\r\n# 0(x=0, y) = 0(y)\r\nassert a(x=0) is Constant(OrderedDict(y=Real), Number(0))\r\n# 0(x=0, y=3.14) = 0\r\nassert a(x=0, y=3.14) is Number(0)\r\n\r\n# Binary ops\r\n\r\n# 1(x, y)\r\na = Constant(OrderedDict(x=Bint[3], y=Real), Number(1))\r\n# b(x)\r\nb = Tensor(...)[\"x\"]\r\n# 1(x, y) *  b(x) = (1 * b(x))(y) = b(x)(y)\r\nc = a * b  # returns Constant(OrderedDict(y=Real), b*Number(1))\r\n\r\n# Reduction\r\n\r\n# 1(x, y)\r\na = Constant(OrderedDict(x=Bint[3], y=Real), Number(1))\r\n# 1(x=0, y) + 1(x=1, y) + 1(x=2, y) = 3(y)\r\na.reduce(ops.add, \"x\")  # returns Constant(OrderedDict(y=Real), Number(3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe argument in `Constant(const_inputs, arg)` doesn't have to be a `Number`. It can be any Funsor with the condition that `const_inputs` and `arg.inputs` have to be disjoint.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation is to use `Constant` as a wrapper for `ProvenanceTensor` and as targets for `log_measures` in a general version of `contrib.fusor.Trace_ELBO` (https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2893).","closed_by":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
