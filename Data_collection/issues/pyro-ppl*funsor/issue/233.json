This design choice forces `.reduce()` to require all vars to appear in the `.inputs` of the funsor being reduced. If instead we required `.reduce()` to input `Variables` (as requested in #211 ), then those variables would have sufficient type metadata to allow reduction over constant terms: for `bint()` reduction variables we would multiply by `var.output.size`, and for `real()` variables we could either do nothing (now) or later multiply by the unit infinite as suggested in #53 .\r\n\r\nOne advantage of this refactoring is that funsors could drop trivial inputs of type `bint(1)`.\r\n\r\nNote following #211 we could still allow string inputs, but raise say a `TypeError` if there is insufficient type metadata to convert all strings to `Variables` (i.e. if any reduction variable does not appear free in the term being reduced). This would ensure backward compatibility.","closed_by":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/233/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
