With this, users can be write code without having to worry about which transforms to use (`sigmoid` is simple but for many constraints, which transform to use is not trivial), for example\r\n```python\r\nweight = Variable(\"x\", constraint=unit_interval)\r\n# weight = Variable(\"x\").sigmoid()\r\nspn = weight  * dist.Categorical([0.2, 0.8], value=\"v0\").exp() \\\r\n    + (1 - weight) * dist.Categorical([0.3, 0.7], value=\"v1\").exp() \r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we can substitute `x` to `spn` as follows:\r\n+ For the pattern `Variable(\"x\").sigmoid()`, we can just substitute an unconstrained value: `spn(x=unconstrained_value)`.\r\n+ For the pattern `Variable(\"x\", constraint=unit_interval)`, it makes more sense to substitute a constrained value: `spn(x=constrained_value)`. For optimizers, it would be nice to have a \"magical\" way to substitute an unconstrained value to `spn`, for example something like `spn(x=unit_interval.transform(unconstrained_value))`.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me how useful constrained variables will be in other situations, so I would like to consider this FR as low priority. It is a nice topic to discuss though.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/502/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/502/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
