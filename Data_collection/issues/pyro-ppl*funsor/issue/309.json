Additionally there would be rules for\r\n- eager substitution `t(x)` which simply calls the forward transform\r\n- inverse followed by eager substitution `t.inv(x)` which calls the inverse transform\r\n- eager substitution of `Delta`s\r\n    ```py\r\n    Delta(\"x\", x, log_density)(x=t(\"y\"))\r\n        => Delta(\"y\", t.inv(x), log_density - t.log_abs_det_jacobian(x))\r\n    ```\r\n- eager reduce of a substitution\r\n    ```py\r\n    f(x=t(y)).reduce(ops.logaddexp, \"y\")\r\n        => (f(x) + t.inv.log_abs_det_jacobian(x)).reduce(ops.logaddexp, \"x\")\r\n    ```\r\n- other reduction rules?\r\n\r\nI think we could implement this as a single class that took a PyTorch/NumPyro transform object\r\n```py\r\nclass Transform(Funsor):  # or maybe Bijector?\r\n    \"Funsor backed by a PyTorch transform object.\"\r\n    def __init__(self, transform):\r\n        self.transform = transform\r\n    @property\r\n    def inv(self):\r\n        return Transform(self.transform.inv)\r\n    def eager_subs(self, subs):\r\n        ...\r\n        return Tensor(self.transform(x.data))\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @stefanwebb","closed_by":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/309/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
