A popular model for robust estimation is Student's t distribution, e.g. as used in Slawek Smyl's models. Like the Gaussian, Student's t filters [1,2,3] and processes [4,5] with shared dof parameter are composable in exact inference. Moreover approximate algorithms allow for differing dof parameters in different parts of the model [3].\r\n\r\n## References\r\n1.
