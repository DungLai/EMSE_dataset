While `funsor.sum_product.sum_product()` is a partial solution, we'd like to generalize to a complete solution.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] Introduce a new Funsor `ConditionalGaussian(info_vec, precision, conditional, inputs)` representing the batched conditional distribution of the rightmost real input variable, conditioned on other real input variables. This could be (i) a new Funsor in addition to `Gaussian`, (ii) a replacement or generalization of `Gaussian`, or (iii) a special case of `Gaussian` where the input `info_vec` and `precision` are structured (requires #556). This may allow cheaper linear algebra.\r\n\r\n    Alternatively #567 \r\n    **Temporary Workaround:** naively scatter the three parameters `(info_vec, precision, conditional)` into a dense `Gaussian`.  This can be much more computationally expensive.\r\n- [ ] Handle collider variables where a latent variable outside a plate depends on an upstream latent variable inside a plate, thereby coupling the upstream variables via moralization. Currently such problems cannot even be specified in the plated-einsum DSL.\r\n    **Temporary workaround:** Globally break all plates out of which any arrow leads; equivalent to `.to_event()`.\r\n- [ ] Handle complete bipartite graphs resulting from the RBM motif (`x_i --> y_ij <-- z_j`). Currently `sum_product()` and the TVE algorithm give up in this case with \"intractable!\".\r\n    **Temporary workaround:** no known workaround\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/559/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
