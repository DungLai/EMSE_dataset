For example we should be able to use `moment_matching` #115 , `linearize` #89 , and EP #90 as proposal distributions.\r\n\r\nKevin Murphy points out:\r\n\r\n> I think these fast, deterministic locally approximating methods [like moment matching and Gaussian approximation] could be really useful as proposals for MC methods.
