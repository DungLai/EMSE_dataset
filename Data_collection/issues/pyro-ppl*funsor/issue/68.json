This `Joint` object is really a state machine / interpreter disguised as a Funsor. Its denotational semantics are defined by its `.eager_subs()` method, and its operational semantics are defined by the transition operations we call on `Joint` objects during inference:\r\n- `+=` a log prob term with either a lazy or eager value\r\n- `.reduce(ops.logaddexp, -)` out variables when they are no longer live\r\n- `.reduce(ops.sample, -)` variables when they need a ground value (e.g. for control flow)\r\n- `.reduce(ops.add, -)` out plates when they are complete (see log_joint in minipyro.py)\r\n\r\nNote that this can be sensibly implemented even before we implement sampling #52 \r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement a `Joint` funsor with `Tensor`, `Gaussian`, and various `Delta` terms\r\n- [ ] Implement `+= Tensor` transition\r\n- [ ] Implement `+= Gaussian` transition\r\n- [ ] Implement `+= Delta` transition\r\n- [ ] Implement `.reduce(ops.logaddexp, -)` to eliminate random variables\r\n- [ ] Implement `.reduce(ops.sample, -)` to sample random variables\r\n- [ ] Implement `.reduce(ops.add, -)` to eliminate plates variables\r\n- [ ] Implement `+= Joint` to fuse two state machines\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Use `Joint` in examples","closed_by":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
