was broken by the introduction of alpha-conversion in #148.  In particular, when the target terms passed to `adjoint(expr, targets)`, which are subexpressions of `expr`, contain variables that are bound in `expr` (e.g. by a `Reduce`), the variables are renamed and `adjoint` cannot find the target terms.  One simple fix would be to introduce an \"unbind\" operation that reverses alpha-renaming and apply it as part of `adjoint`.","closed_by":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
