Models based on active inference are quite similar to HMM. An interesting application of active inference is in reinforcement learning, where we keep getting feedbacks (observations) from environment and improve the model/guide to make it best reflecting these observations. By setting desired priors on observation nodes, we can train the model/guide to achieve a goal without having to use rewards as in RL. Because it is just an extended version of HMM, I think that `funsor` is a good tool for it.\r\n\r\nHere are some references which I found clearest to understand the theory behind:\r\n+ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416301336\r\n+ https://medium.com/@solopchuk/tutorial-on-active-inference-30edcf50f5dc\r\n+ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2019.00020/full\r\n\r\nThe third one is doing inference by message passing on a bipartite graph, which seems closest to `funsor`. I don't know what is the current state of `funsor` so I'll try to go step-by-step to understand `funsor` more. Maybe I can contribute to `funsor` a bit during the way. But it would be great help if some of you are also interested in this direction and we can discuss more about it. :)\r\n\r\ncc @eb8680 @fritzo @neerajprad ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/144/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
