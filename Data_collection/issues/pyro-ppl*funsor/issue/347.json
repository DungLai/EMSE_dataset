However, it would be more natural from the rest of Funsor's perspective to have `enumerate_support` return a `Delta` over the support values plus a weight tensor, like `Funsor.sample`.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to remind me to make that change at some point after more of `contrib.funsor` is finished in Pyro, unless someone else wants to take a stab at it.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
