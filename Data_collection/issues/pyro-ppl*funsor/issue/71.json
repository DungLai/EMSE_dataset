currently implements variable elimination entirely with sum and product ops, but for efficiency these should be fused into a GEMM-like Contract op for at least binary contractions.\r\n\r\nWe could support finitary contractions, but binary contractions are very basic: they are GEMM-like ops, inner products in Hilbert spaces, the basic tensor contraction of cutensor, and the basic op in an
