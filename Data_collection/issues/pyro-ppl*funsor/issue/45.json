So for example the [tractability theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03210) is weaker for Gaussian models than discrete models. This is relevant for `funsor.optimizer` because opt_einsum's greedy objective is memory size assuming exponential growth (in [compute_size_by_dict](https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum/blob/v2.3.2/opt_einsum/helpers.py#L51)).\r\n\r\nWe should send a fix to opt_einsum to support a more general `flop_count()` function, possibly supporting non-integer sizes in their shapes. If this change is too intrusive upstream, we might simply fork their path optimizer for use in finsor. However it would be preferable to keep funsor simple and defer to opt_einsum wherever possible.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/45/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
