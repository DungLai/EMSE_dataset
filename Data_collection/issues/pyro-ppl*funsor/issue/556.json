One advantage of this approach is that a forward-backward algorithm could be performed symbolically, such that each SVI step would require only a substitution, rather than a complete optimization pass.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] Support more complex slicing operations #555\r\n- [ ] Create a `literally_eager` interpretation that does not normalize.
