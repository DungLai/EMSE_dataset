The recipe is:\r\n1. add new `*args, *kwargs` to your op in `funsor.ops.array`\r\n2. add backend support in `funsor.torch.ops` and `funsor.jax.ops`\r\n3. implement `find_domain(op, ...)` in `funsor.domains`\r\n4. work around batch dimensions in `funsor.tensor`\r\n5. add some tests\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] unit test for various op arg,kwarg syntax\r\n- [x] unit test for batched

#489 \r\npartly pair coded with @eb8680 \r\n\r\nThis major op refactoring aims to unblock @ordabayevy in #477 and #482 by allowing ops to have arbitrary *arg,**kwarg parameters.  Changes include:\r\n- `nullop` is renamed to `null` for consistency (`NullOp` remains unchanged).\r\n- Dispatch tables are moved from op instances to op subclasses.\r\n- `@make_op` has moved to a classmethod `@MyOpClass.make` e.g. `@BinaryOp.make`\r\n- Each concrete op subclass has a fixed `.arity` attribute.\r\n- Op patterns dispatch on only the first `[:arity]`-many args (and patterns are validated to ensure this).\r\n- Ops are new weakly cached via `WeakValueDict`.\r\n- `.subclass_register()` handlers have a different inferface, now including `cls`.\r\n- There is now a single shared `WrappedTransformOp` class, and its instances each have an op.\r\n- `ops.WrappedTransformOp(fn)` must now be written as a kwarg `ops.WrappedTransformOp(fn=fn)`\r\n- `is_numeric_array()` is demoted from an `Op` to a `@singledispatch`.\r\n- `ops.stack` interface has changed to `ops.stack(parts, dim)` as in NumPy and PyTorch.\r\n- `funsor.tensor.stack` is replaced by `ops.stack`.\r\n- `ops.einsum` interface has changed to `ops.einsum(operands, equation)` where `operands` is a list or tuple.\r\n- `Finitary` funsor interface has changed from variously-many args to a single tuple arg.\r\n\r\n##
