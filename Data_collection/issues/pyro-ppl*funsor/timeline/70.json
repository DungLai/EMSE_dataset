#68 \r\nBased on #65 \r\n\r\nThis implements a `Joint` funsor incorporating a single `Number`/`Tensor`, a single `Gaussian` (or `Number(0)` if not needed), and zero or more `Delta`s. See #68 for motivation.\r\n\r\nPyro handles distributions of a few different forms. With `num_particles=1` Pyro handles a product-of-deltas (i.e. a single sample at each site):\r\n```py\r\nFinitary(ops.add, (Delta(...), ..., Delta(...)))  # product in log-space\r\n```\r\nThe same representation works for vectorized particles, since the reduction doesn't happen until the end, so each `Delta` can carry an extra `particles` input dim.\r\n\r\n`TraceEnum_ELBO` in Pyro supports lazy discrete samples, which would be represented as a product of a single Tensor (for all enumerated sites) and finitely many Deltas for sampled sites.\r\n```py\r\nFinitary(ops.add, (Tensor(...), Delta(...), Delta(...), ..., Delta(...)))\r\n```\r\nNote 1. `JointNormalForm` is intended as the interpreter during an optimized variable elimination schedule, therefore we store a single treewidth-sized `Tensor` rather than separate factors.\r\nNote 2. unless we support direct products #70, plates are handled outside of `JointNormalForm`.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the generalized Gaussian #37 which combines a joint distribution among multiple Categorical, Normal, and MultivariateNormal random variables, which can all be sampled lazily. Thus the initial representation in Funsor is\r\n```py\r\nFinitary(ops.add, (Delta(...), ..., Delta(...), Tensor(...), Gaussian(...)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] add tests for `Joint` ops\r\n- [x] add tests for promotion to

currently contains many different representations of multilinear operations (e.g. `Joint`, `Affine`, `Finitary`, `Contract`, `Integrate`, `Binary`, `Reduce`, `einsum`, `sum_product`, ...) that approximately duplicate lots of logic and don't always play well together.\r\n\r\nIn a sequence of refactoring PRs, I would like to unify most of the duplicated linear algebra or normalization logic in the codebase while preserving all existing test cases and computational properties.  Specifically, I would like to:\r\n1. #157 Add a `Contraction` normal form representing finitary sum-product operations with eager definitions implemented entirely in terms of unary and binary sum-product operations, and a `normalize` interpretation putting multilinear expressions into a DNF-like normal form\r\n2. #157 Insert `normalize` as the underlying interpretation to which `eager` defaults, displacing `reflect` (optionally at first, using an environment variable as with the changes in #149).\r\n3. #173 Remove `Affine` and replace with `Contraction` while preserving all existing test cases and functionality\r\n4. #165 Simplify the optimizer by removing `Finitary`, `Contract`, `funsor.contract._simplify_contract`, and the `associate`, `distribute` and `desugar` interpretations used internally, and making it work with `normalize` and `Contraction`s directly\r\n5. #169 Simplify `Integrate` by removing the duplicate functionality of `funsor.integrate._simplify_integrate`\r\n6. #169 Remove `Joint` and replace with `Contraction` and `MultiDelta` while preserving all `Joint` test cases and computational properties.  This will also further simplify `eager`, since most of `Joint`'s functionality is already contained in the first PR.\r\n7. #169 Remove `Delta` entirely in favor of `MultiDelta` so that deltas are closed under addition/logaddexp like `Gaussian` and `Tensor`\r\n10. Troubleshoot performance issues related to interleaved interpreters (see `test_gaussian.py::test_eager_subs`, `test_samplers.py::test_gaussian_distribution`, `test_terms.py::test_reduce_subset` for cases of severe slowdowns)\r\n8. Simplify `eager` by removing all purely algebraic computations from `eager` that are now handled by `normalize`, such as `funsor.terms.eager.distribute_binary_reduce_other`, and narrowing the focus of `eager` to only performing eager computations that actually invoke backend ops.\r\n9. Rename `Contraction` -> `Contract`, `MultiDelta` -> `Empirical`, remove `Delta` entirely, move patterns in `joint.py` to `integrate.py`\r\n11. Make optimization the default (merge `eager_contraction_generic_tuple` and the optimizer generic `Contraction` pattern from #165 )\r\n\r\nMore speculative: can we naturally and generically handle plate and scan dimensions #70 in `normalize`?\r\n\r\nPlan for code review/merging:\r\n1. Finish PRs for steps 1-6 above\r\n2. Review and merge those PRs into #157, in descending order (i.e. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\r\n3. Merge the final version of #157 into `master`\r\n4. Make normalization the default and address steps 8-10 in cleanup PRs\r\n\r\nNon-goals:\r\n- I do not plan to replace or remove `Unary`, `Binary`, `Integrate`, or `Reduce`\r\n- I do not plan to change any `eager` definitions or require them to be written in terms of `Contraction`.  `normalize` should not be proscriptive about the specification of eager operations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/156/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T21:21:38Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T21:21:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/162","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/162/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/162/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/162/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/162","id":468964050,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Njg5NjQwNTA=","number":162,"title":"Implement

#70 #177\r\nPair coded with @eb8680 \r\n\r\nThis aims to generalize `sequential_sum_product()` from simple contractions to arbitrary contractions with different window size. This aims to be maximally general and should be able to be integrated into the TVE algorithm `partial_sum_product()` (as in the [convolve-method branch](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/compare/convolve-method?expand=1)).\r\n\r\n## Design Questions\r\n- [ ] What problem class should we address? E.g. should this assume that the components have already been decomposed by a connected components algorithm? I've started to enumerate test cases, and I think we should spend a many hours whiteboarding examples to understand the problem class (as we did with TVE).\r\n- [ ] How can we pass around the metadata of time lags? This PR attempts to do so via name mangling of `.inputs.keys()`, but that approach won't currently work because alpha binding mangles names in a different way. Indeed the alpha mangling appears to thwart other nearby designs such as passing in a side-information dict indicating which names correspond to which lags. One possible solution is to make alpha renaming less intrusive. @eb8680 can you think about possible solutions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/167/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T20:22:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T20:22:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/171","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/171/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/171/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/171/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/171","id":472500849,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzAwODgwNzEz","number":171,"title":"Implement
