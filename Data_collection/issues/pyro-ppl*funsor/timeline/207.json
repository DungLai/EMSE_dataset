For example,\r\n```\r\nx.triangular_solve(y)\r\n```\r\nwill be\r\n```\r\nself.backend.triangular_solve(x, y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that there is a lot of work to do but I hope that future refactoring will be easier after this.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n\r\n- ~[] subclass Tensor to TorchTensor~ this is not necessary for now\r\n- [x] collect and implement all required ~static methods~ ops for TorchTensor\r\n- [x] use the above ~static methods~ ops in Gaussian\r\n- [x] do the same for other classes/functions in `gaussian.py`\r\n- [x] make sure all tests pass\r\n- [x] make align_tensors and

#207 \r\n\r\nFollow up discussions at #317, this PR supports global backend in funsor.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for reviewing, I list here important changes in this PR:\r\n+ Separate out `jax` and `numpy` implementation. I also take this chance to reorder those ops according to their names (to make it easier to compare different backends or to find some specific implementation).\r\n+ Use `numpy` for default implementation of numeric ops. `funsor.torch` or `funsor.jax` are lazily imported, depending on the environment variable FUNSOR_BACKEND or the usage of `funsor.set_backend(...)`.\r\n+ We can change backend using the utility `set_backend`. There is a problem: if we have change backend to JAX, we can't revert back to `numpy` backend.\r\n+ Port Pyro Tensordot implementation to funsor. Pyro implementation has some statements `x.dim()`, which is not available for ndarray\r\n+ Despite that we will use numpy backend by default, I still use PyTorch names (except for `amax`, `amin`) for those ops (like the current master branch). I guess Pyro devs would like PyTorch names than NumPy names for numeric ops.\r\n\r\nSome small changes:\r\n+ replace `torch._C._get_tracing_state` by `funsor.util.get_tracing_state`\r\n+ add `funsor.util.is_nn_module`\r\n+ add `ops.is_numeric_array` to check if a variable is a numeric array. We can rename it to `ops.is_tensor` to match `torch.is_tensor` if prefered.\r\n+ add `ops.detach` to detach gradient. This is no op for numpy backend.\r\n+ fix issues of `ops.log` which gives warnings at 0. value\r\n+ support both `tuple` or iterator for testing utilities `randn`, `zeros`,... (because I found so many places in test files that use that pattern `torch.zeros(1, 2, 3)` instead of `torch.zeros((1, 2, 3))`).\r\n+ dispatch for `recursion_reinterpret.register(torch.Tensor)` is implemented in `torch.py` file, instead of `interpreter.py` file. (similar for `children`, `to_funsor`, `allclose`)\r\n+ others are cleanup and reordering changes\r\n\r\n### Tests pass with all backends\r\n- [x] test_affine\r\n- [x] test_alpha_conversion\r\n- [x]

#362, #207, https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2630\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to resolve cyclic dependency issues that are preventing Pyro from depending on `funsor`. The underlying issue is that `funsor.torch` depends on Pyro for distributions and some math helpers, but we would like Pyro to be able to depend on Funsor. This cyclic dependency is an issue because `funsor.torch` calls `import pyro` and then `pyro` calls `import funsor`. This PR resolves the issue by delaying backend-specific module loading until `set_backend()` is called, so that Pyro can `import funsor` without any Pyro dependencies. Then once `pyro` is fully loaded, Pyro code that uses Funsor can call `funsor.set_backend(\"torch\")` as needed, triggering full loading of `funsor.torch`.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the backend configuration\r\n```py\r\nset_backend(os.environ.get(\"FUNSOR_BACKEND\", \"numpy\"))\r\n```\r\nfrom `funsor/__init__.py` to `test/conftest.py`. After this PR, the `FUNSOR_BACKEND` environment variable is no longer part of the public interface; instead it merely controls pytest testing. Henceforth all examples explicitly call `set_backend(\"torch\")`; in the future we may also make the examples more generic and read backend from an environment variable.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/768372612","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/207#issuecomment-768372612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/207","id":768372612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODM3MjYxMg==","user":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-27T15:40:38Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T15:40:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm going to close this as resolved.
