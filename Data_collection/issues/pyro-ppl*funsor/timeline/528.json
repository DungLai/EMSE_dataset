coded with @eb8680 \r\n\r\nThis attempts to implement answer set programming and a SAT example.\r\n\r\nBlocking issues include:\r\n- AdjointTape and Approximate seem a bit awkward in representing these abstractions.  Maybe they conflate two concepts like (product of marginals, joint distributions); maybe we should separate those concepts.\r\n- It would be nice to have a `Stream` funsor. Currently Funsor objects eagerly compute metadata, but a `Stream` would need lazily computed length.  Thus as part of #526 we may want to make `funsor.meta(-)` lazier.\r\n- This requires intricate use of `Delta` and we may want to first decide whether `Scatter` should replace `Delta` #528","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
