#184\r\nAddresses #177\r\nBlocking #185 #180 \r\n\r\nThis refactors the `Gaussian` class to use the \"information filter\" representation, replacing\r\n```\r\n(loc, precision)  -->  (precision @ loc, precision)\r\n```\r\nThis allows `Gaussian` operations on rank-deficient factors, as e.g. arise in `GaussianHMM` #185 and `SwitchingLinearHMM` #180 . This PR also switches from `torch.inverse()` to more numerically stable Cholesky-based inverse and solve operations.\r\n\r\n@fehiepsi I have chosen to leave the `0.5 * n * log(2 * pi)` factor out of the log normalizer in this PR, which makes `Gaussian`s closed under addition and leads to convenient identity `∀g:Gaussian, g(0) == 0`. Note that normalizing factors are accounted for in to-funsor conversion, e.g. in `funsor.distributions` and `funsor.pyro.convert.mvn_to_funsor()`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\nI am fairly confident that this PR is correct, given our good test coverage.\r\n- refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- added a test for the new invariant `g(0) = 0`\r\n- added unit tests for `cholesky_solve` and `cholesky_inverse`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/186/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2535286248,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjUzNTI4NjI0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2535286248","actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-06T02:53:35Z","label":{"name":"numerics","color":"0c7f72"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2538022681,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUzODAyMjY4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2538022681","actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-06T20:27:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
