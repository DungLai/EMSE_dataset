#96.  Blocking #130.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes to substitution and interpretation:\r\n1. Adds eager alpha-renaming whenever a variable is newly bound\r\n2. Adds `.fresh` and `.bound` attributes to each term (empty by default) which are `frozenset`s of names of fresh variables introduced by a term and variables newly bound by a term respectively.  These must be manually populated in the `__init__` method of each new term if they are not empty for that term.\r\n3. Changes the semantics of the `Subs` term slightly: there is now a `substitute` function that calls itself recursively, as opposed to `Subs` calling `eager_subs` methods which in turn recursively call `Subs`.  A `Subs` term now represents a lazy call to `substitute`.  I did this instead of manually changing every call to `Subs` inside an `eager_subs` method into recursive `eager_subs` calls.\r\n4. Makes substitution more generic, removing the need for `.eager_subs` implementations in terms that don't introduce fresh variables and simplifying the implementation of new terms.  Hopefully most `eager_subs` methods of terms that don't introduce fresh variables can be removed in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Add `.fresh` and `.bound` to any remaining terms missing them and add some tests checking\r\n- [x] Fix various minor regressions (`Affine`, `Joint`, `Stack`, `Lambda`, `Independent`, etc)\r\n- [x] Add new tests exercising alpha-renaming (which would currently trigger `NotImplementedError`s)\r\n\r\nTriaged:\r\n- Make `funsor.adjoint` compatible with alpha-renaming\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/148/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2438856583,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQzODg1NjU4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2438856583","actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-25T20:34:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
