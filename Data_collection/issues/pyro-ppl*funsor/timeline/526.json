to #526\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\n\r\nFunsors currently store data in immutable structures that are typically either nested tuples or frozensets, e.g. `Subs` converts its dict argument to a nested tuple-of-tuples representing key,value pairs.  These internal data structures complicate funsor traversal algorithms (e.g. `reinterpret`, `ast()`, `get_children()`), since the intermediate non-`Funsor` data structures lack metadata such as `.inputs`, `.output`, `.fresh`, `.bound`.  This complication manifests as extra checks for `isinstance(-, Funsor)` and extra handling to manually traverse funsor data asts.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes to replace all internal data structure of funsors by additional low-level Pythonic funsors `Tuple`, `Dict`, and `Set`.  Like other more mathy funsors, these data structural funsors implement metadata like `.inputs`, `.output`, substitution via `.__call__()` and reinterpreted construction and hash consing via `type(-).__call__()`.\r\n\r\nFor example `Subs.subs : Dict`, `Delta.terms : Dict`, etc.\r\n\r\n## Remaining questions\r\n\r\n1. Should we also implement `Funsor` subclasses for constants `Str` as used as keys? Ideally all terms would be immutable and hash-consed, however `str`s are used so ubiquitously as keys that it may not be worth the performance overhead.  One option would be to instead rely on Python's built-in hash-consing of strings via [sys.intern()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.intern) and move metadata elsewhere, as in #526\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement an immutable `Dict` funsor\r\n- [ ] Implement an immutable `Set` funsor\r\n- [ ] Use `Dict` and `Set` internally in other `Funsor`s\r\n- [ ] Simplify

coded with @eb8680 \r\n\r\nThis attempts to implement answer set programming and a SAT example.\r\n\r\nBlocking issues include:\r\n- AdjointTape and Approximate seem a bit awkward in representing these abstractions.  Maybe they conflate two concepts like (product of marginals, joint distributions); maybe we should separate those concepts.\r\n- It would be nice to have a `Stream` funsor. Currently Funsor objects eagerly compute metadata, but a `Stream` would need lazily computed length.  Thus as part of #526 we may want to make `funsor.meta(-)` lazier.\r\n- This requires intricate use of `Delta` and we may want to first decide whether `Scatter` should replace `Delta` #528","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
