#96.  Blocking #130.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes to substitution and interpretation:\r\n1. Adds eager alpha-renaming whenever a variable is newly bound\r\n2. Adds `.fresh` and `.bound` attributes to each term (empty by default) which are `frozenset`s of names of fresh variables introduced by a term and variables newly bound by a term respectively.  These must be manually populated in the `__init__` method of each new term if they are not empty for that term.\r\n3. Changes the semantics of the `Subs` term slightly: there is now a `substitute` function that calls itself recursively, as opposed to `Subs` calling `eager_subs` methods which in turn recursively call `Subs`.  A `Subs` term now represents a lazy call to `substitute`.  I did this instead of manually changing every call to `Subs` inside an `eager_subs` method into recursive `eager_subs` calls.\r\n4. Makes substitution more generic, removing the need for `.eager_subs` implementations in terms that don't introduce fresh variables and simplifying the implementation of new terms.  Hopefully most `eager_subs` methods of terms that don't introduce fresh variables can be removed in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Add `.fresh` and `.bound` to any remaining terms missing them and add some tests checking\r\n- [x] Fix various minor regressions (`Affine`, `Joint`, `Stack`, `Lambda`, `Independent`, etc)\r\n- [x] Add new tests exercising alpha-renaming (which would currently trigger `NotImplementedError`s)\r\n\r\nTriaged:\r\n- Make `funsor.adjoint` compatible with alpha-renaming\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/148/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T19:00:00Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T19:00:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/152","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/152/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/152/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/152/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/152","id":460588239,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjkxNjg5ODM5","number":152,"title":"Remove

currently contains many different representations of multilinear operations (e.g. `Joint`, `Affine`, `Finitary`, `Contract`, `Integrate`, `Binary`, `Reduce`, `einsum`, `sum_product`, ...) that approximately duplicate lots of logic and don't always play well together.\r\n\r\nIn a sequence of refactoring PRs, I would like to unify most of the duplicated linear algebra or normalization logic in the codebase while preserving all existing test cases and computational properties.  Specifically, I would like to:\r\n1. #157 Add a `Contraction` normal form representing finitary sum-product operations with eager definitions implemented entirely in terms of unary and binary sum-product operations, and a `normalize` interpretation putting multilinear expressions into a DNF-like normal form\r\n2. #157 Insert `normalize` as the underlying interpretation to which `eager` defaults, displacing `reflect` (optionally at first, using an environment variable as with the changes in #149).\r\n3. #173 Remove `Affine` and replace with `Contraction` while preserving all existing test cases and functionality\r\n4. #165 Simplify the optimizer by removing `Finitary`, `Contract`, `funsor.contract._simplify_contract`, and the `associate`, `distribute` and `desugar` interpretations used internally, and making it work with `normalize` and `Contraction`s directly\r\n5. #169 Simplify `Integrate` by removing the duplicate functionality of `funsor.integrate._simplify_integrate`\r\n6. #169 Remove `Joint` and replace with `Contraction` and `MultiDelta` while preserving all `Joint` test cases and computational properties.  This will also further simplify `eager`, since most of `Joint`'s functionality is already contained in the first PR.\r\n7. #169 Remove `Delta` entirely in favor of `MultiDelta` so that deltas are closed under addition/logaddexp like `Gaussian` and `Tensor`\r\n10. Troubleshoot performance issues related to interleaved interpreters (see `test_gaussian.py::test_eager_subs`, `test_samplers.py::test_gaussian_distribution`, `test_terms.py::test_reduce_subset` for cases of severe slowdowns)\r\n8. Simplify `eager` by removing all purely algebraic computations from `eager` that are now handled by `normalize`, such as `funsor.terms.eager.distribute_binary_reduce_other`, and narrowing the focus of `eager` to only performing eager computations that actually invoke backend ops.\r\n9. Rename `Contraction` -> `Contract`, `MultiDelta` -> `Empirical`, remove `Delta` entirely, move patterns in `joint.py` to `integrate.py`\r\n11. Make optimization the default (merge `eager_contraction_generic_tuple` and the optimizer generic `Contraction` pattern from #165 )\r\n\r\nMore speculative: can we naturally and generically handle plate and scan dimensions #70 in `normalize`?\r\n\r\nPlan for code review/merging:\r\n1. Finish PRs for steps 1-6 above\r\n2. Review and merge those PRs into #157, in descending order (i.e. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\r\n3. Merge the final version of #157 into `master`\r\n4. Make normalization the default and address steps 8-10 in cleanup PRs\r\n\r\nNon-goals:\r\n- I do not plan to replace or remove `Unary`, `Binary`, `Integrate`, or `Reduce`\r\n- I do not plan to change any `eager` definitions or require them to be written in terms of `Contraction`.  `normalize` should not be proscriptive about the specification of eager operations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/156/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
