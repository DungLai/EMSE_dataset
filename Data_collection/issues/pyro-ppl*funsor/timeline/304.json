removed\r\n- [ ] Create a `CommutativeOp` or `CommutativeAssociativeOp` class to distinguish between commutative and non-commutative monoids\r\n- [ ] Create a `Semiring` data structure for use by `Contraction` and `normalize` containing a sum and product op and (where applicable) their units and inverses instead of passing around separate ops `sum_op` and `prod_op` and storing units and

#2182 \r\n\r\n1. Adds a method `GaussianHMM.posterior(likelihood)` that produces a new `GaussianHMM` instance incorporating the original `GaussianHMM` thought of as a prior, and the `likelihood` distribution (a MVN or Independent(Normal)).\r\n2. Implements a parallel-scan forward-filter backward-rsample algorithm `_sequential_gaussian_filter_sample()`.\r\n3. Refactors `GaussianHMM.rsample()` to use parallel scan, and removes old lazy logic to support the previous linear `.rsample()` implementation from #2238 .\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] shape test for `_sequential_gaussian_filter_sample()`\r\n- [x] shape test for `GaussianHMM.posterior()`\r\n- [x] distribution test for `GaussianHMM.posterior().rsample()`\r\n- [x] distribution test for `GaussianHMM.posterior().log_prob()`\r\n- [x] test the computed `log_normalizer`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2285/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
