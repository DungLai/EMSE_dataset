perform variable elimination in Gaussian graphical models with plates. While `funsor.sum_product.sum_product()` is a partial solution, we'd like to generalize to a complete solution.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] Introduce a new Funsor `ConditionalGaussian(info_vec, precision, conditional, inputs)` representing the batched conditional distribution of the rightmost real input variable, conditioned on other real input variables. This could be (i) a new Funsor in addition to `Gaussian`, (ii) a replacement or generalization of `Gaussian`, or (iii) a special case of `Gaussian` where the input `info_vec` and `precision` are structured (requires #556). This may allow cheaper linear algebra.\r\n\r\n    Alternatively #567 \r\n    **Temporary Workaround:** naively scatter the three parameters `(info_vec, precision, conditional)` into a dense `Gaussian`.  This can be much more computationally expensive.\r\n- [ ] Handle collider variables where a latent variable outside a plate depends on an upstream latent variable inside a plate, thereby coupling the upstream variables via moralization. Currently such problems cannot even be specified in the plated-einsum DSL.\r\n    **Temporary workaround:** Globally break all plates out of which any arrow leads; equivalent to `.to_event()`.\r\n- [ ] Handle complete bipartite graphs resulting from the RBM motif (`x_i --> y_ij <-- z_j`). Currently `sum_product()` and the TVE algorithm give up in this case with \"intractable!\".\r\n    **Temporary workaround:** no known workaround\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/559/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T03:52:29Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T03:52:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/568","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/568/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/568/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/568/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/568","id":1019579187,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCgoJts4s3suP","number":568,"title":"Switch

#567 \r\nAdapts @fehiepsi's https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2019\r\n\r\nThis switches the internal Gaussian representation to a numerically stable and space efficient representation\r\n```diff\r\n- Gaussian(info_vec, precision, inputs)\r\n+ Gaussian(white_vec, prec_sqrt, inputs)\r\n```\r\nIn the new parametrization, Gaussians represent the log-density function\r\n```py\r\nGaussian(white_vec, prec_sqrt, OrderedDict(x=Reals[n]))\r\n  = -1/2 || x @ prec_sqrt - white_vec ||^2\r\n```\r\nThese two parameters are shaped to efficiently represent low-rank data:\r\n```py\r\nassert white_vec.shape == batch_shape + (rank,)\r\nassert prec_sqrt.shape == batch_shape + (dim, rank)\r\n```\r\nreducing space complexity from `O(dim(dim+1))` to `O(rank(dim+1))`. In my real-world example rank=1, dim=2369, and batch_shape=(1343,), so the space reduction is 30GB → 13MB.\r\n\r\nComputations is cheap in this representation: addition amounts to concatenation, and plate-reduction amounts to transpose and reshape.  Some ops are only supported on full-rank Gaussians, and I've added checks based on the new property `.is_full_rank`.  This partial support is ok because the Gaussian funsors that arise in Bayesian models are all full rank due to priors (notwithstanding numerical loss of rank).\r\n\r\nBecause the Gaussian funsor is internal, the interface change should not cause breakage of most user code, since most user code uses `to_funsor()` and `to_data()` with backend-specific distributions.  One broken piece of user code is Pyro's [AutoGaussianFunsor](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/ac3c588c7e18a695000f87322e037d31ad2900e5/pyro/infer/autoguide/gaussian.py#L434-L436) which will need an update (and which will be sped up).\r\n\r\nAs suggested by @eb8680, I've added some optional kwarg parametrizations and properties to support conversion to other Gaussian representations, e.g. `g = Gaussian(mean=..., covariance=..., inputs=...)` and `g._mean`, `g._covariance`.  This allows more Gaussian math to live in gaussian.py.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] added new tests\r\n- [x] pass existing funsor tests (linear algebra)\r\n- [x] pass existing funsor tests (patterns)\r\n- [x] pass NumPyro tests (conjugacy)\r\n- [x] pass Pyro tests on a branch (https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2943)\r\n- [x] check computational cost on the pyro-cov model (results: under 12GB memory)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/568/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/568/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5478943111,"node_id":"CE_lADOCgoJts48tJtOzwAAAAFGkgmH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/5478943111","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-18T14:39:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
