suggested adding metadata to `Domain` objects or `.input` dicts to declare which inputs are plate indices. This is similar to @jpchen's suggestion of a `Cat` funsor, but would also support cat-broadcasting. From a mathematical perspective, adding funsors with different plate indices would be a direct sum.\r\n\r\nI believe the best way to implement this is to first implement correct math in `funsor.minipyro.log_joint` and then to refactor it into `Domain` or `Funsor`.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] #56 sketch plate math in `funsor.minipyro.log_joint`\r\n- [x] #57 fix minipyro and add tests\r\n- [ ] #109 add plate-aware contract/expectation ops\r\n- [ ] Add a funsor `Conv(x, time_dim, curr_dim, next_dim, new_dim)` satisfying\r\n     ```py\r\n     Conv(f, \"time\", \"curr\", \"next\", \"curr\")(curr=x)\r\n         = f(curr=x(time=arange(\"time\", f.inputs[\"time\"].dtype - 1)),\r\n             next=x(time=arange(\"time\", f.inputs[\"time\"].dtype - 1) + 1))\r\n     ```\r\n- [x] #161 Implement log(time) convolution op following [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13002)\r\n- [x] #292 Generalize `sequential_sum_product` to handle longer time lags\r\n- [ ] Support time dims in `partial_sum_product` (see [convolve-method branch](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/compare/convolve-method?expand=1))\r\n- [ ] Add a state space example using `Conv` applied to a contiguous stacked nn output\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/70/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/70/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T07:15:20Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T07:15:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/100","id":425260059,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjY0Mzk4OTUy","number":100,"title":"Add

#57 \r\n\r\nThis makes distributions lazy when used Pyro-style, but keeps them eager when used Funsor-style.\r\n\r\nIn Pyro we construct distributions without specifying the variable name:\r\n```py\r\nfn = dist.Normal(0, 1)    # from a pyro.sample statement\r\nlog_prob += fn(value)     # from an internal elbo computation\r\n```\r\nWhereas in Funsor we idiomatically name the variate\r\n```py\r\nfactor = dist.Normal(0, 1, Variable('x', reals()))\r\nlog_prob += factor\r\n```\r\nPrior to this PR, `dist.Normal(0,1)` would eagerly compile to a `Gaussian`. After this PR, `dist.Normal(0,1)` remains an inspectable `Normal` distribution until its value is substituted (possibly for another variable), e.g. in the second line above.\r\n\r\nAdvantage of this PR include:\r\n1. We can avoid some computation (currently not even implemented, and inevitable numerically unstable) in pyro observe statements whose parameters are delayed variables, since a large (rank deficient) Gaussian will never be constructed. Instead we will wait until an observation is available as in the above example elbo computation.\r\n2. Pyro statements will be a little more debuggable since the original distribution will be available.\r\n\r\nThis may seem a little gross, but I see it as a way for funsor.distributions to be used in both older pyro-style and newer funsor-style with no conflict (e.g. no funsor.compat.distributions shim).\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- [x] Should we instead simply disallow specifying the variate in the `__init__` method?\r\n    This way all distributions would be lazily constructed, and could be converted to e.g. `Gaussian` or `Joint` by substitution of `variable`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- updated
