is a step towards having StudentT filters (see https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/190).\r\n\r\nThe main reference which I use is [1], which constructs an exact filter for scaled mixtures of normals and elliptically contoured distributions (which are more general than StudentT). I am not sure if this approach will work for us but it is the most promising one which I know. The idea is to introduce an auxiliary Gamma variable `s`, which we will keep updating the posteriors `p(x | s, y)` and `p(s | y)` during filtering process.\r\n\r\nMy intuition is to mimic how StudentT filter works\r\n```\r\n1. p(x_t-1 | y1,...,y_t-1, s) = Normal(m, sC), where p(s|y1,...y_t-1) = Gamma(a, b)\r\n2. p(xt | y1,...,y_t-1, s) = Normal(..., sD)\r\n3. p(yt | y1,...,y_t-1, s) = Normal(..., sE)\r\n4. p(xt | y1,...,yt, s) = Normal(..., sF)\r\n5. p(s | y1,...,yt) ~ p(s | y1,...,yt-1).p(yt=yt | y1...,y_t-1, s) = Gamma(a', b')\r\n```\r\nwhere steps 1-4 follow Kalman filter predict and update.\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n1. [Bayesian Kalman Filtering with Elliptically Contoured Errors](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2336969?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\r\n\r\n### Done\r\n- Implement trivial event methods: pad, permute, add\r\n\r\n### Tasks (ordered according to its complexity)\r\n- [x] Implement event_logsumexp\r\n- [x] Implement condition\r\n- [x] Implement marginalize\r\n- [x] Add tests for the above methods\r\n- [x] Implement matrix_and_mvt_to_GaussianGamma. An auxiliary Gamma variable `s` will be introduced so that p(x, s) is GaussianGamma and the marginal p(x) is StudentT.\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR (this PR is already large)\r\n- ~Test against the formula in the paper\r\n[Student’s t-Filters for Noise Scale Estimation](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/pub/SPL2019.pdf)~ Edit: use `skip_multiplier_prior` flag for that model, no need to test because we can implement the same model\r\n\r\nHopefully all pieces will stick together. So we can use temporal parallelization for StudentT

I doubt we yet have the machinery for an end-to-end heavy-tailed HMM example, but that could probably be done in ~1 week of coding.
