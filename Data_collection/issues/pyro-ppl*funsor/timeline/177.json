#70 #177\r\nPair coded with @eb8680 \r\n\r\nThis aims to generalize `sequential_sum_product()` from simple contractions to arbitrary contractions with different window size. This aims to be maximally general and should be able to be integrated into the TVE algorithm `partial_sum_product()` (as in the [convolve-method branch](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/compare/convolve-method?expand=1)).\r\n\r\n## Design Questions\r\n- [ ] What problem class should we address? E.g. should this assume that the components have already been decomposed by a connected components algorithm? I've started to enumerate test cases, and I think we should spend a many hours whiteboarding examples to understand the problem class (as we did with TVE).\r\n- [ ] How can we pass around the metadata of time lags? This PR attempts to do so via name mangling of `.inputs.keys()`, but that approach won't currently work because alpha binding mangles names in a different way. Indeed the alpha mangling appears to thwart other nearby designs such as passing in a side-information dict indicating which names correspond to which lags. One possible solution is to make alpha renaming less intrusive. @eb8680 can you think about possible solutions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/167/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T00:05:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T00:05:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/170","id":472499220,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzAwODc5ODYz","number":170,"title":"Add

The class is intended to wrap a `Funsor` as a `Distribution` object for use in Pyro.\r\n\r\nI've created a new module `funsor.pyro` and I plan to create new submodules like `funsor.pyro.hmm` #171 containing various hidden-markov models (discrete, gaussian, slds, ...). Each of these distributions will use fancy funsor syntax internally, but will expose their inference algorithms as black-box `Distributions` with `.sample()` and `.log_prob()` methods. These distributions should be fully compatible with broadcasting, plates, and enumeration dims (which should pass right through these algorithms).\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- added unit tests for

[pyro.ops.gaussian.Gaussian.condition()](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/3619772/pyro/ops/gaussian.py#L125). Differences include: (1) funsor is more complex due to arbitrary substitution shape combinations, and (2) funsor uses loc=mean rather than the info_vec parametrization.\r\n\r\nThis op is required for

precision)\r\n```\r\nThis allows `Gaussian` operations on rank-deficient factors, as e.g. arise in `GaussianHMM` #185 and `SwitchingLinearHMM` #180 . This PR also switches from `torch.inverse()` to more numerically stable Cholesky-based inverse and solve operations.\r\n\r\n@fehiepsi I have chosen to leave the `0.5 * n * log(2 * pi)` factor out of the log normalizer in this PR, which makes `Gaussian`s closed under addition and leads to convenient identity `∀g:Gaussian, g(0) == 0`. Note that normalizing factors are accounted for in to-funsor conversion, e.g. in `funsor.distributions` and `funsor.pyro.convert.mvn_to_funsor()`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\nI am fairly confident that this

#162, #177 \r\n\r\nThis promotes `Cat` to a funsor, implemented using variadic pattern matching following #157 so that homogeneous Stack/Tensor/Gaussian/Joint funsors can be concatenated eagerly.\r\n\r\nThis also reorders `Stack(components,name)` -> `Stack(name,parts)` to agree with `Cat` and make it a little cleaner for both funsors to use variadic pattern matching.\r\n\r\nThis does not implement every possible `Cat` pattern; rather this PR aims to implement only what is needed for `sequential_sum_product()`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- unit tests for `Cat` and eager Tensor fusion\r\n- refactoring is exercised by `sequential_sum_product()` tests
