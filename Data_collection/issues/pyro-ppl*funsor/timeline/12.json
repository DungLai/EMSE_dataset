#1304 Sequential Monte Carlo\r\nRequires #915 dependent enumeration, #1302 local `num_particles`\r\n\r\nCurrently `TraceEnum_ELBO` would have exponential cost in the number of sampled variables (via local `num_particles` #1302). To mitigate this growth, we could introduce an SMC resampling step in the computation, effectively implementing a COO sparse tensor format whose metadata is recorded in Pyro's `CondIndepStack`. Roughly:\r\n1. Allocate a new tensor dim to index over COO entries of an existing set of tensor dims, say of combined shape `resample_shape`.\r\n2. Resample the existing tensor dims using `num_particles` sparse entries. This will transform a tensor between shapes w.l.o.g.\r\n    ```\r\n    resample_shape + keep_shape -> (num_particles,) + (1,)*len(resample_shape) + keep_shape\r\n    ```\r\n2. Perform special handling of sparse tensor dims in `Dice` and `EnumTraceProbEvaluator`, using metadata stored in the `CondIndepStack`. The special handling should adjust sample weights based on the resampling
