#386. ~~Blocked by #388.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new file `test_distribution_generic.py` that refactors the distribution tests. Here there is one generic test for each distribution method, and all that is needed to test a new distribution is to add a recipe for constructing a random instance to a list of test cases.  This change is necessary if we want to approach full coverage of the dozens of distributions in PyTorch, Pyro/NumPyro and TFP without thousands of lines of manually duplicated testing logic.\r\n\r\nI have also had to add a number of small fixes to get the new tests to pass, which I would argue is a sign of the value of these tests - even the first version here is exercising many small distribution API edge cases that would be hard to catch with the current approach.  There are also a couple of new testing utilities (`ops.isnan` and `testing.random_scale_tril`).\r\n\r\nIf the approach in this PR works, I will delete many of the one-off tests in `test_distribution.py` in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nRemaining tasks:\r\n- [x] Get generic gradient test running\r\n- [x] Add enough test cases to reach coverage parity with the tests in `test_distribution.py`\r\n- [x] Get all deterministic tests to pass and avoid nans\r\n\r\nTriaged\r\n- ~~Get all Monte Carlo tests to pass~~ - I am skeptical of the viability and usefulness of doing this and have simply disabled and removed these tests for

#386. Motivated by @ordabayevy's [forum post](https://forum.pyro.ai/t/how-to-make-custom-distributions-funsor-compatible/2351/2) about generating Funsor wrappers for custom distributions.\r\n\r\nCurrently, generic `TorchDistribution`-to-`funsor.distribution.Distribution` conversion is handled by a single pattern:\r\n```py\r\n@to_funsor.register(pyro.distributions.Distribution)\r\ndef backenddist_to_funsor(backend_dist, output=None, dim_to_name=None):\r\n    funsor_dist_class = ...\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nThis design requires the pattern to somehow identify a Funsor counterpart `funsor_dist_class` to `backend_dist`, which it currently does somewhat hackily by looking in the global namespace.  This PR tweaks this logic so that no lookup is necessary:\r\n```py\r\ndef backenddist_to_funsor(funsor_dist_class, backend_dist, ...):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nto_funsor.register(MyDistribution)(functools.partial(backenddist_to_funsor, funsor_dist_class))\r\n```\r\nBy including the final line above in the distribution wrapper generator

#309, #386. ~~Blocked by #387, #388, #389.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for converting `Transform`s and `TransformedDistribution`s to and from Funsors, and for sampling and scoring with`funsor.Distribution`s with transforms in their `value` slot.  \r\n\r\n~~The latter is achieved with a new term I've called `Lebesgue` for want of a better idea, which computes log-det-jacobians of lazy expressions substituted into its free variable using `funsor.delta.solve`.~~ (**Update**: I'm moving `Lebesgue` to another PR, since it no longer seems necessary for the basic task of converting `TransformedDistribution`s.)\r\n\r\nThere are several ways this functionality could have been instantiated.  The design choices in this version were made with a view toward locality of changes - the overall distribution API is left unchanged, as is the behavior of `normalize` and `eager`, and I've reused `funsor.delta.solve` even though it should probably be broken up into separate inversion and linearization transformations.\r\n\r\nThe number of transforms currently supported is very limited, partly because we don't have many transforms wrapped as `TransformOp`s in Funsor and partly because `solve` cannot handle inverting more complex expressions.  I've at least tried to get the two most important higher-order transforms `ComposeTransform` and `InverseTransform` working, so that adding more transforms later will be relatively straightforward.  For ease of review, I have also chosen to leave support for the JAX backend to a followup PR, though it should simply involve copying the additions to `funsor.torch.distributions` verbatim.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Added several `TransformedDistribution` test cases using the infrastructure from #389 \r\n\r\nTasks remaining:\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for density\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for cons-hashing\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for sampling\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for transform conversion\r\n- [x] Get generic conversion tests to pass\r\n\r\nOut of scope for this PR:\r\n- Support more transforms\r\n- Add similar capability to the JAX backend\r\n- Add more distribution conversion unit tests, especially interactions with `Independent` - added one `Independent` case, but conversion failing\r\n- Add better documentation for working with transformed distributions and `Lebesgue` - moving `Lebesgue` to another

#386, https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2702\r\n\r\nConsider the following snippet of Pyro code simplified from a test in https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2702 :\r\n```py\r\nwith pyro.plate(\"data\", T, dim=-1):\r\n    y = pyro.sample(\"y\", dist.Normal(torch.ones(3), 1.).to_event(1))\r\n    pyro.sample(\"z\", dist.Normal(y, 1.).to_event(1), obs=data)\r\n```\r\nAttempting to wrap this in a `poutine.collapse()` context fails when `dist.Normal(y, 1)` is incorrectly converted to a Funsor. In particular, there is a mismatch between `y.output`, which is `Reals[3]` and the `.output` value `Real` expected for the `loc` param of `funsor.torch.distributions.Normal` given by `funsor.distribution.Distribution._infer_value_domain`.\r\n\r\nIn cases like the above, however, it is always possible to infer the correct parameter and value `.output` shapes generically using the broadcasting logic in the underlying backend distribution.  This PR implements this behavior in `funsor.distribution.DistributionMeta.__call__` and `distribution_to_data`.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, it is possible after this PR to represent `Independent` distributions without an intermediary `funsor.Independent` by passing a `Variable` with extra output dimensions as the `value`:\r\n```py\r\n# diagonal multivariate normal in pyro:\r\ndist.Normal(zeros(3), 1.).to_event(1)\r\n\r\n# funsor equivalent, after this PR - note Reals[3] for x\r\nNormal(loc=zeros(3), scale=1., value=Variable(\"x\", Reals[3]))\r\n```\r\nThis should considerably simplify pattern-matching over `Independent` distributions.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, converting a `funsor.distribution.Distribution` to data via `funsor.to_data` will have to include a step handling nontrivial event shapes by calling `.to_event` and unsqueezing parameters.\r\n\r\nMore ambitiously, we could also attempt to handle `to_funsor` conversion of backend `Independent` distributions by substituting an appropriately shaped `Variable` for their value rather than resorting to lazy application of `funsor.terms.Independent`, which would make pattern-matching for `collapse`ing multivariate distributions much easier, but it's not clear yet whether this can be done generically, especially in the presence of transforms.  I have not attempted to do this in this PR.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Update `funsor.distribution.DistributionMeta`\r\n- [x] Update `distribution_to_data`\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [x] Fix
