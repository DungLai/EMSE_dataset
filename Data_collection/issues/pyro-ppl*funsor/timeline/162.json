#177 \r\n\r\nThis adds `Gaussian` support to `sequential_sum_product()`. This required:\r\n- supporting `Gaussian` and `Joint` in our ad-hoc `Cat` funsor\r\n- adding a `Joint.align()` method\r\n- fixing typos in `sequential_sum_product()` (as @eb8680 and I noticed offline)\r\n\r\nNote this means we can now implement asymptotically fast Kalman filter learning with funsor. (Provisos include: (1) only for full-rank observation distributions, (2) fast asymptotically, but with a big constant factor due to our broadcast-multiply-reduce implementation of gaussian_gemm).\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- added a grid of normal and multivariate normal tests to
