discussed in #61, this refactors `funsor.ops` to move any torch specific ops to the `torch` module. Once this is merged, we can implement the corresponding operations for the `numpy` backend. The Op class now inherits from `Dispatcher`.\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n - The default dispatcher for object types currently defaults to numpy for dispatching. I believe that we can save a small amount of time if we were to dispatch directly via `obj.sqrt()` instead of `np.sqrt(obj)`. Is this worth doing, i.e. separating out the dispatchers for Number and object type?\r\n - In `torch.py` file, for binary operators with distinct types, I had to keep the other type as `object` (consistent with our earlier implementation). Am I correct in understanding that for all operations - we expect raw (i.e. non Funsor wrapped) types except for `funsor.Number` where we can either get a wrapper `Number` or a python numeric type? My guess is yes based on the tests, but just wondering if this is a conscious decision.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/74/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/472563951","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/61#issuecomment-472563951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/61","id":472563951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjU2Mzk1MQ==","user":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T19:08:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T19:08:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed by #74 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/472563951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2201326981,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwMTMyNjk4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2201326981","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T19:08:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
