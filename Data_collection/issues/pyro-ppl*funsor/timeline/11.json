#52 \r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. Adds an `Integrate(log_measure, integrand, reduced_vars)` funsor.\r\n2. Adds a `monte_carlo` interpretation of the `Integrate` funsor.\r\n3. Changes `.sample()` to include the normalization factor (i.e. `1/product(sample_shape)`).\r\n4. Fixes logs of little flaws:\r\n    - supporting broadcasting of output shape in `Tensor`\r\n    - fixed & clarified some Cholesky manipulations `Gaussian`\r\n    - fixed handling of `torch.nn.Module` in `funsor.torch.function`\r\n    - fixed `GetitemOp.__name__`\r\n    - made `funsor.testing` a little more robust\r\n    - improved `FUNSOR_DEBUG` logging\r\n    - ...\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- [x] test
