#110 \r\nAddresses #90 \r\nPair coded with @martinjankowiak \r\n\r\nThis adds a `moment_matching` interpretation of `Joint.reduce(ops.logaddexp, -)` to allow projection of a Gaussian mixture to a single Gaussian (per remaining free variable).\r\n\r\nThis also adds a Switching Linear Dynamicsl System example that exercises the new approximation.\r\n\r\nNote @eb8680 this also adds a distributivity rule to the eager interpretation, which appears to be needed if we represent mixture models as lazy reductions.
