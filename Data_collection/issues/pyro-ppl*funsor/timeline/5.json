this still being worked on? If not, I could give it a try. If Pyro's `BetaBinomial` were exposed, I could register a `Contraction` for `Beta` and `Binomial` over the Beta's value to produce a `BetaBinomial`. Then I'd register a `Binary` `SubOp` between the joint `Contraction[Beta,Binomial]` and `BetaBinomial` to produce the posterior `Beta`.

have Dirichlet -Multinomial conjugacy working, but Beta-Binomial is a little tricky. The eager interpretation of a Beta is just to convert it to a Dirichlet (in `eager_beta` from `funsor/distribution.py:357`). This means I can't dispatch on Betas to take advantage of conjugacy: they vanish! I tried assembling the Beta and Bernoulli in a lazy interpretation before reducing them in an eager interpretation. This couldn't get around the problem, unfortunately. A Contraction's arguments get reinterpreted under eager mode  when the Contraction is interpreted under eager mode, so once again the Betas  get converted to Dirichlets. Perhaps this doesn't matter- if we have Dirichlet-Multinomial conjugacy, and Betas and Binomials get converted to Dirichlets and Multinomials automatically anyway, then we get conjugacy for Betas and Binomials for free. \r\n\r\nShall I make a pull request for the Dirichlet Multinomial
