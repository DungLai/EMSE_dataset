#228 \r\nBlocking #226\r\n\r\nThis PR has two aims.\r\n\r\n1. Refactor alpha conversion logic to allow a fix to `Independent` in #226 .\r\nBefore this PR, `alpha_substitute()` was a single function with ad hoc logic to hopefully cover most cases. This PR refactors to a method `._alpha_subs()`, splitting the old if-else handling into method overloads, and adds new method overloads for a few Funsors.\r\n\r\n2. Ensure `to_funsor()` is called outside of `substitute()`.\r\nBefore this PR, alpha_convert would sometimes call `substitute()` with non-funsor values, necessitating `to_funsor()` conversions in various `eager_subs()` methods. This PR removes those old `to_funsor()` calls and adds new `to_funsor()` calls in the `._alpha_subs()` methods of each `Funsor` subclass with bound variables. This appears to be the narrowest place where relevant type information is available, since types of bound variables are not available in the `.inputs` dict.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- added an assertion to `substitute()` checking that all inputs are funsors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T04:00:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T04:00:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/226","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/226/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/226/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/226/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/226","id":490097605,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzE0NzcwNjA3","number":226,"title":"Make

The math and code structure are nearly identical. As in Pyro we create a temporary `AffineNormal` object to avoid expensive intermediate computations.\r\n\r\nOne difference in Funsor is that the `AffineNormal.condition()` method becomes a pattern. For testing purposes I've added another simple pattern, fixing `x` rather than `y`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- added unit test for the `AffineNormal` funsor\r\n- added a unit test comparing `Independent(Normal)` vs `MultivariateNormal(..., scale.diag_embed())` (ported from

#228 \r\n\r\nThis fixes bugs in alpha conversion logic of `Subs`, `Cat`, and `Slice`. Additionally this moves type checking logic from `substitute` down to `SubsMeta` so that type mismatch errors are caught earlier.\r\n\r\nThe `Subs` bugs involve an incorrect definition of `.bound` and incorrect handling of substitution in `._alpha_convert()`. For example this case previously failed:\r\n```py\r\nwith interpretation(reflect):\r\n    Slice('t', 3)(t=Slice('t', 2, dtype=3)).reduce(ops.add)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main `Cat` bug is deeper and involves type mismatch between the axis variable of the component parts (this variable is bound) and the resulting axis variable of the concatenation. Before this PR `Cat` did not bind any variables. After this PR `Cat` has two real variables that can share the same name: a longer `fresh` concatenated variable and a shorter `bound` part variable; only the bound variable is renamed during `._alpha_convert()`; and only the fresh variable is substituted during `.eager_subs()`.\r\n\r\nThe `Slice.eager_subs` bug from #230 involved not preserving `.dtype` information.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- [x] refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- [x] made substitution type checking stricter\r\n- [x] added a regression test for `Subs` and `Slice`\r\n- [x] added a regression

#228 \r\n\r\nThis adds `MarkovProduct` as a lazy `sequential_sum_product()`. Changes include:\r\n- Refactor `sequential_sum_product()` to input `time` as a `Variable` rather than string\r\n  (for the same reason as #233 ).\r\n- Refactor `GaussianHMM` and `GaussianMRF` to use `MarkovProduct`. Note that `DiscreteHMM` cannot be converted until we allow `bint()` domains with nontrivial shape.\r\n- Fixed some docs.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- added `MarkovProduct` cases to test_sum_product.py\r\n- `GaussianHMM` and `GaussianMRF` refactoring is covered by test/pyro/test_hmm.py\r\n- updated test/examples/test_bart.py to use `MarkovProduct`\r\n- ran `make docs`

#228 \r\n\r\nThis PR adds adjoint machinery necessary for computing backward marginals through `sequential_sum_product`.  In particular, it adds general adjoint methods for `Subs` of `Tensor` and for `Cat`, completing support for the operations appearing in `sequential_sum_product` and unblocking the adjoint experiments.  The adjoint for `Subs` of `Tensor` is implemented in such a way that generalizing it to integer variable substitution in `Gaussian`s should be very straightforward, and I'll do that in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nI've also simplified `adjoint` slightly by removing the multiplicities that were being tracked previously and removing the one suspect test that required their presence.\r\n\r\nRemaining tasks:\r\n- [x] In theory `adjoint` should work for eager `MarkovProduct` evaluation as well, but even though it simply calls `sequential_sum_product` internally, the test cases that call `MarkovProduct` are failing.  I'm not sure what's happening there, but would like to include a fix in this PR.
