https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2813\r\n\r\nThis adds a `Precondition` interpretation for Gaussian factor graphs.\r\n\r\nSimilar to batched `MonteCarlo(..., sample_inputs)` where samples depend on a discrete sample index, `Precondition()` returns samples that depend on a single white noise input `aux : Reals[total_num_elements]`. Notably this new interpretation is deterministic, since the samples are drawn lazily. These lazy samples can then be used for sampling by either substituting white noise (in variational inference) or substituting an HMC-controlled vector. Specifically, this can be used to implement Pyro's `AutoGaussian.get_transform()` for use in `NeuTraReparam`.\r\n\r\nChanges to `Gaussian._sample()` can be seen as a first step towards making `Gaussian` depend on `funsor.Tensor`s rather than backend arrays, as suggested by @eb8680 #556.\r\n\r\n## Remaining tasks\r\n- [x] implement `Gaussian - Gaussian`\r\n- [x] implement `Subs._sample()`\r\n- [x] implement `Gaussian._sample()` for subsets of real variables\r\n- [x] implement `ops.cat`\r\n- [x] implement `ops.randn`\r\n- [x] revert `Gaussian - Gaussian` which turns out to be incorrect\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- [x] test
