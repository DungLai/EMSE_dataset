Some design questions:\r\n1. Could we replace `find_domain` with some standard Python type inference library?  Are there existing special array types in NumPy or elsewhere we should use rather than making a custom `Domain`?\r\n2. Would some version of this also get us shape polymorphism (as in #214) for free?  If not, does it at least not put up an intrinsic barrier to shape variables ([`typing.Literal` is currently very limited](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0586/#interactions-with-generics))? \r\n3. How would this interact with surrounding typed Python code?  That is, what is the type signature of `to_funsor` applied to a `Callable` as in the above examples?\r\n4. Should we distinguish between a black-box `funsor.function` that creates a custom new `funsor.Function` term and a transparent `funsor.to_funsor` that attempts to extract a funsor expression by evaluating the function on appropriately typed `funsor.Variable`s?\r\n\r\n>  Possibly promote Funsor types themselves to subtypes of Callable\r\n\r\nI was more thinking about making all `funsor.Funsor`s subtypes of `typing.Generic`, so that the parametrized types generated by `FunsorMeta` and used in our interpreters would be proper Python types and we could typecheck our interpreters with standard Python typecheckers.  That seems orthogonal to this issue - it is about the types of Funsor *interpreters*, rather than the types of Funsors themselves as in this issue.  Making `funsor.Funsor`s subtypes of `Callable`, and presumably also including `Domain`s in interpreter type signatures and thus removing the boundary between the two issues, would be much more ambitious and would likely break the first-order restriction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/674467968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-16T03:32:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-16T03:32:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/352","id":679680686,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDY4MzkxNTg4","number":352,"title":"Refactor

great questions!\r\n1. I like the idea of being not only more Pythonic but closer to the NumPy ecosystem. Let's see what we can find.\r\n   EDIT it looks like numpy-stubs was merged into numpy, providing [nascent typing support](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/typing.html)\r\n2. Yes I believe we can get polymorphism using type variables 🎉 \r\n3. Maybe we can make `Funsor` a subclass of `Callable`, i.e. a callable that supports pointwise evaluation.\r\n4. I suppose `to_funsor()` behavior could depend on

#351 \r\n\r\nThis makes Funsors act a little more like functions in three ways:\r\n1. `@funsor.function` can now be applied to an type-annotated function, e.g.\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    - @funsor.function(reals(4), (reals(), bint(4)))\r\n    - def max_and_argmax(x):\r\n    + @funsor.function\r\n    + def max_and_argmax(x: Real[4]) -> Tuple[Real, Bint[4]]:\r\n          return torch.max(x, -1)\r\n    ```\r\n2. `@of_type` is replaced by `@symbolic` with nearly the same syntax as `@function`.\r\n3. Adds a property `Funsor.__annotations__` to support `typing.get_type_hints`. In this PR, `__annotations__` is computed from `.inputs`, `.output`; in the future we may want to reverse the dependency?\r\n\r\nIn particular this PR illuminates a path towards generalizing funsor types from `Union[Real[shape], Bint[size]]` to more general PyTree-like types including nested `Tuple`s.\r\n\r\nRegarding @eb8680's [question 4](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/351#issuecomment-674467968), `to_funsor` does not yet interpret a callable as either `@function` or `@symbolic`. It is an open design question which of these should be called.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] unit tests\r\n- [x] updated distribution tests to use the new

It would improve the development experience, increase performance and beneficially constrain Funsor's design to make Funsor interpreters and lazy expressions more compatible with Python's standard `typing` module and even with MyPy.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, this seems straightforward: just make all subclasses of `funsor.Funsor` inherit from `typing.Generic` and move type annotations from `register` calls to function signatures, e.g.:\r\n```py\r\nOp = TypeVar(\"Op\", bound=ops.AssociativeOp)\r\nArg = TypeVar(\"Arg\", bound=Funsor)\r\nReducedVars = TypeVar(\"ReducedVars\", bound=FrozenSet[str])\r\n\r\nclass Reduce(Funsor, Generic[Op, Arg, ReducedVars]):\r\n    def __init__(self, op: Op, arg: Arg, reduced_vars: ReducedVars):\r\n        ...  # note we should be able to remove all hand-written type assertions here\r\n\r\nLhs = TypeVar(\"Lhs\", bound=Funsor)\r\nRhs = TypeVar(\"Rhs\", bound=Funsor)\r\n\r\nclass Binary(Funsor, Generic[Op, Lhs, Rhs]):\r\n    def __init__(self, op, lhs, rhs):\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n# a random example pattern (a+b).sum() -> (a.sum() + b.sum())\r\n@eager.register(Reduce)\r\ndef eager_reduce_example_pattern(\r\n        op: ops.AddOp, \r\n        arg: Binary[ops.AddOp, Funsor, Funsor],\r\n        reduced_vars: FrozenSet[str]\r\n    ):\r\n    return Binary(arg.op, Reduce(op, arg.lhs, reduced_vars), Reduce(op, arg.rhs, reduced_vars))\r\n```\r\nWe'd also have to modify `KeyedRegistry` along the lines of https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch/pull/69 using `pytypes.deep_type` for dispatch to continue to work correctly, and define `FunsorMeta.__subclasscheck__` with `pytypes.is_subtype` rather than the custom logic it currently contains.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are lots of design details that may prevent fully statically checkable interpreters or at least make them undesirable for other reasons. For example, the obtrusive type variables in the snippet would seem to be mandatory - if their creation were automated and folded into `FunsorMeta.__init__`, the result would not be compatible with static type checkers like MyPy, which seems to be incompatible with any internal logic in metaclasses.  It's also not clear that the way we construct finer types at runtime with `reflect` between intepreter calls would be compatible with MyPy.\r\n\r\nThese caveats may not apply to runtime type checkers like pytypes, which could still cut out lots of boilerplate and improve performance, so perhaps this is the best starting point. Note that there are [Python version compatibility issues](https://github.com/Stewori/pytypes/issues/40) upstream in pytypes that might cause other problems (but seem to be mostly resolved in the master branch).\r\n\r\nNote that this issue is orthogonal to #351, which is about the types of Funsors themselves rather than the type signatures of interpretations, despite the similar motivations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-18T16:27:36Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T16:27:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/356","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/356/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/356/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/356/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/356","id":681174881,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDY5NjA3NjI3","number":356,"title":"Unify

#351, #355.\r\n\r\nThis is a more ambitious version of the changes in #433 that uses the `typing`-compatible runtime type checking library [pytypes](https://github.com/Stewori/pytypes) for type checking and inference (via `pytypes.is_subtype`, a `typing`-compatible version of `issubclass`) and for pattern matching (via a [pytypes-based fork](https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch/compare/master...eb8680:pytypes-master?expand=1) of multipledispatch that uses `pytypes.is_subtype` in place of `issubclass`).\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, it should be possible to use all of `typing` directly when describing funsor input and output types or when writing patterns, e.g. we could simply replace `Product` from #430 with `typing.Tuple`:\r\n```py\r\nclass Tuple(Funsor):\r\n    def __init__(self, args):\r\n        ...\r\n        output = typing.Tuple[tuple(arg.output for arg in args)]\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n...or use `typing.Tuple`, including variadic cases, in patterns like the ones needed for `Finitary` in #423:\r\n```py\r\n@eager.register(Finitary)\r\ndef eager_finitary_generic(\r\n        op: EinsumOp, \r\n        args: typing.Tuple[typing.Union[Tensor, Number], ...]  # variadic\r\n    ) -> typing.Union[Tensor, Number]:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nAs suggested in #355, we could even replace many of the assertions in our `Funsor.__init__` methods with runtime type checking in interpreters, eliminating lots of boilerplate code and potentially boosting performance (by making many assertions optional):\r\n```py\r\nclass FunsorMeta(type):\r\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        ...\r\n        if interpreter.TYPECHECK:\r\n            assert all(pytypes.is_of_type(arg, static_arg_type)  # is_of_type == isinstance\r\n                        for arg, static_arg_type in zip(args, get_type_hints(cls.__init__)))\r\n        return interpret(cls, *args)\r\n```\r\n```diff\r\n# example\r\nclass Reduce(Funsor):\r\n-     def __init__(self, op, arg, reduced_vars):\r\n+     def __init__(self, op: ops.AssociativeOp, arg: Funsor, reduced_vars: typing.FrozenSet[Variable]):\r\n-         assert callable(op)\r\n-         assert isinstance(arg, Funsor)\r\n-         assert isinstance(reduced_vars, frozenset)\r\n-         assert all(isinstance(v, Variable) for v in reduced_vars)\r\n          reduced_names = frozenset(v.name for v in reduced_vars)\r\n          ...\r\n```\r\nI have also taken the opportunity to remove some of the uglier code in `FunsorMeta` and domains made obsolete by the use of `pytypes` and `typing`, including the custom introspection and subtype checking logic in `FunsorMeta`.\r\n\r\nIn #355 I had originally suggested going even further toward integrating `typing` with Funsor interpretations than the changes here by making parametric `Funsor` subtypes use `typing.Generic`.  I am somewhat skeptical about taking that additional step because of how difficult it is to interact with `typing.Generic` at runtime, and have chosen in this PR to retain a simplified version of the `GenericTypeMeta` class as a substrate for `Funsor` and `FunsorMeta`.\r\n\r\nOne critical question for this approach is how well the `multipledispatch` fork holds up in terms of correctness and performance and how much additional maintenance effort it would entail.  In an ideal world, someone else would implement a performant, fully `typing`-compatible `multipledispatch` completely independent of Funsor and we could just use their solution, since that's clearly a useful and interesting direction in its own right and there are a number of new runtime type checkers ([1](https://github.com/erezsh/runtype), [2](https://github.com/beartype/beartype)) that could be repurposed to support it.\r\n\r\nHowever, since that is unlikely (AFAIK) in the near term and the developers of `multipledispatch` are not interested in merging the `pytypes`-based version (which I took and lightly modified from [an old pull request there](https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch/pull/69)), we'd have to maintain the fork ourselves.  The core functionality seems to be largely complete - almost all of the multipledispatch and Funsor tests pass locally, and pytypes itself is extensively tested.  We might need to add a dedicated `typing`-compatible `Dispatcher` upon which to base `funsor.ops.Op` and `funsor.registry.KeyedRegistry` that makes sure signatures use `typing` syntax, e.g. converting tuples to `typing.Union`s or `object` to `typing.Any`.  As for performance, running tests locally shows there is definitely a slowdown relative to the current `multipledispatch`, although it's much less severe than the discussion in that `multipledispatch` PR would suggest.\r\n\r\nAnother practical issue is the compatibility of `pytypes` with various Python versions, especially 3.7-3.9.  It seems like that's been addressed to a large extent in their `master` branch, at least for the subset of `typing` we would use in Funsor, but I'm not entirely sure what its status is or when any outstanding issues might be resolved.\r\n\r\nI am cautiously optimistic about these questions, but it's too early to say right now whether they'd end up being show-stoppers relative to the status quo or the simpler approach in #433.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/434/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T01:48:24Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T01:48:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/451","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/451/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/451/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/451/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/451","id":799668705,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTY2Mjc2ODgz","number":451,"title":"Add

#351, #355. Supercedes #433, #434. Would unblock #423, although it might be easier to fix that independently.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a self-contained `funsor.typing` module for runtime dispatch and typechecking of parametric types, especially Funsor term types.\r\n\r\nIt contains three distinct pieces of functionality extracted from `FunsorMeta`:\r\n1. Replacements for `type`, `isinstance` and `issubclass` that are compatible with a limited subset of Funsor/`typing`-style generic types, including Funsor terms, `typing.Tuple`s and `typing.FrozenSet`s, mimicking similar APIs in `pytypes` (albeit with much less coverage of `typing`).\r\n2. A new metaclass `funsor.typing.GenericTypeMeta` whose purpose is to support parametric subtyping, handle cons-hashing of parametric types and support runtime `issubclass` checks, and a minimal introspection API matching `typing`'s `get_args`/`get_origin`/`get_type_hints`.\r\n3. A `multipledispatch.dispatcher.Dispatcher` subclass that is capable of making use of this new functionality and is used by all Funsor `dispatched_interpretation`s via `funsor.registry.KeyedRegistry`\r\n\r\nI have also refactored and drastically simplified `FunsorMeta` using this machinery. In a followup PR I will do the same for `funsor.domains.ArrayType`.\r\n\r\n### Context \r\n\r\nAfter these changes, it should be possible to use some of the Python standard `typing` library directly when describing funsor input and output types or when writing patterns, e.g. we could simply replace `Product` from #430 with `typing.Tuple`:\r\n```py\r\nclass Tuple(Funsor):\r\n    def __init__(self, args):\r\n        ...\r\n        output = typing.Tuple[tuple(arg.output for arg in args)]\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n...or use `typing.Tuple`, including variadic cases, in patterns like the ones needed for `Finitary` in #423:\r\n```py\r\n@eager.register(Finitary)\r\ndef eager_finitary_generic(\r\n        op: EinsumOp, \r\n        args: typing.Tuple[typing.Union[Tensor, Number], ...]  # variadic\r\n    ) -> typing.Union[Tensor, Number]:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nAs suggested in #355, we could even replace many of the assertions in our `Funsor.__init__` methods with runtime type checking in interpreters, eliminating lots of boilerplate code and potentially boosting performance (by making many assertions optional):\r\n```py\r\nclass FunsorMeta(type):\r\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        ...\r\n        if interpreter.TYPECHECK:\r\n            assert all(isinstance(arg, static_arg_type)\r\n                        for arg, static_arg_type in zip(args, get_type_hints(cls.__init__)))\r\n        return interpret(cls, *args)\r\n```\r\n```diff\r\n# example\r\nclass Reduce(Funsor):\r\n-     def __init__(self, op, arg, reduced_vars):\r\n+     def __init__(self, op: ops.AssociativeOp, arg: Funsor, reduced_vars: typing.FrozenSet[Variable]):\r\n-         assert callable(op)\r\n-         assert isinstance(arg, Funsor)\r\n-         assert isinstance(reduced_vars, frozenset)\r\n-         assert all(isinstance(v, Variable) for v in reduced_vars)\r\n          reduced_names = frozenset(v.name for v in reduced_vars)\r\n          ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn #355 I had originally suggested going even further toward integrating `typing` with Funsor interpretations than the changes here by making parametric `Funsor` subtypes use `typing.Generic`.  I am somewhat skeptical about taking that additional step because of how difficult it is to interact with `typing.Generic` at runtime, and have chosen in this PR to retain a simplified version of the `GenericTypeMeta` class as a substrate for `Funsor` and `FunsorMeta`.\r\n\r\n### Tested\r\n- Exercised by all existing tests that use interpretations\r\n\r\n### Remaining tasks\r\n- [x] Resolve any `typing`-related dependency issues for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\r\n- [x] Move the existing `issubclass` tests in `test_terms.py` to a new file `test_typing.py`\r\n- [x] Add more standalone tests to `test_typing.py`\r\n- [x] Add more documentation\r\n\r\n### Triaged\r\n- Investigate performance regressions with the new `Dispatcher` and `FunsorMeta` implementations - this appears to be less severe than originally feared, so I am OK with addressing performance in future PRs unless there's a really easy fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/451/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/801192479","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/351#issuecomment-801192479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/351","id":801192479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTE5MjQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T15:48:01Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T15:48:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@eb8680
