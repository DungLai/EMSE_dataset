throwing out an idea here. Another perspective on two different semi-rings (ops.add, ops.mul) and (ops.logaddexp, ops.add) is to view the latter as operations lifted by a `Log` Functor. In Haskell notation:\r\n\r\n```hs\r\ninstance Functor Log where\r\n    fmap f :: Log a -> Log b\r\n    fmap f (Log a) = Log (f a)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nfmap (*) (Log (x, y)) = Log (x*y) = Log x + Log y\r\nfmap (+)  = logaddexp\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two different types could be represented by something like `Factor` and `Logfactor` funsors which can be used for pattern matching. Not sure if this adds anything new though.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, can Funsor be used to represent partially applied functions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/782571137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ordabayevy","id":50752571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50752571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy","html_url":"https://github.com/ordabayevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/782876975","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/446#issuecomment-782876975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/446","id":782876975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4Mjg3Njk3NQ==","user":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-21T15:36:37Z","updated_at":"2021-02-21T15:36:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ordabayevy yes I think your `Log` functor relates the semiring pair `((add,mul), (logaddexp,add))` and the pair `((max,mul),(max,add))`.

is an implementation of autodiff. The goal is to address issues in computing expectations in `TraceEnum_ELBO` and `TraceMarkovEnum_ELBO` (#493).
