#16 \r\nSee [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVlfQnNQ0Aebg8vfIGcJKsnSqAhB4bbClQrb5dwm2OM) for details.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Support tensor-valued dims and multivariate distributions.\r\n- Change constructor delegation order following #13:\r\n- Simplify `FunsorMeta.__call__()` by replacing `effectful` with a single settable function, defined by `funsor.interpreter`. The function is accessed by `interpreter.interpret()` and `funsor.eval()` is renamed to `interpreter.reinterpret()`.\r\n- Implement three interpretations by default: `eager`, `lazy` (for lazy ops but eager substitution), and `reflect` (completely lazy).\r\n- Delete everything not essential to basic design goals: bracket indexing, Align, Branch, simplification, obsolete engines, pattern matching, ...\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] add funsor.domains\r\n- [x] add funsor.interpretations\r\n- [x] update funsor.terms\r\n- [x] update funsor.torch\r\n- [x] delete funsor.contract etc.\r\n- [x] update examples (mark all as xfail)\r\n- [x] remove funsor.adjoint tests\r\n- [x] update test/test_terms.py\r\n- [x] delete obsolete engines (`contract_engine`, `tree_engine`)\r\n- [x] update test/test_torch.py\r\n- ~~update funsor.distributions~~\r\n- ~~update test/test_distributions.py~~\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/17/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2157145113,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE1NzE0NTExMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2157145113","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-22T08:01:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
