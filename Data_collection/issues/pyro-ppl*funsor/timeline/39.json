associativity of `Finitary` ops\r\n- [x] Exploit associativity of `Reduce` ops\r\n- [x] Exploit distributivity for `Reduce` and `Finitary`\r\n- [x] Support multiple semirings\r\n- [x] Support distributivity in mixed terms like `Finitary(Reduce, Finitary)`\r\n- [x] Add HMM-style test cases that only work with optimization enabled\r\n- [x] Add more tests that exercise edge cases\r\n\r\nTriaged:\r\n- Distribute `Finitary` ops over one another (no optimizer for this currently)\r\n- Implement tensor variable elimination #9 \r\n- Handle variable name collisons correctly
