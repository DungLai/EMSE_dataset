#293. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new implementation of `MarkovProduct`/`sequential_sum_product` that interpolates between fully left-to-right and fully parallel-scan elimination orders.  It accepts an additional argument `num_segments`, chops up `trans` into `num_segments` contiguous segments of equal length, and performs left-to-right elimination via `naive_sequential_sum_product` on those segments, then `Stack`s the results and performs parallel-scan elimination on the remaining internal variables.\r\n\r\nWhen `num_segments == duration`, this reduces to `sequential_sum_product`; when `num_segments == 1`, this reduces to `naive_sequential_sum_product`.\r\n\r\nThis operation becomes more interesting when `trans` has some internal structure, e.g. when it is a lazy expression produced by `sarkka_bilmes_product`.  Eliminating some variables left-to-right initially can save some memory and potentially unnecessary computation, at the expense of parallelism.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Added to `sequential_sum_product` tests in `test_sum_product.py`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T06:42:06Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T06:42:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2687","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2687/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2687/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2687/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2687","id":735493875,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzU0OTM4NzU=","number":2687,"title":"FR

to have a more flexible version of `DiscreteHMM`.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI'm working with a model where several variables depend on  a discrete markovian state: \r\n\r\n`p(z_k | z_{k-1})` and `Categorical(m_k | z_k)`, `Gamma(h_k | z_k)`, `Beta(x_k | z_k)`\r\n\r\nI propose to introduce a new distribution `MarkovianCategorical` for `z` and integrate out `z` with `MarkovProduct` at the very end (this would be similar how enumeration works in `TraceEnum_ELBO`). Below is the snippet of `MarkovianCategorical` that I've written but I don't know how to make it funsor compatible. The logic for `log_prob` here depends on the whether the `value` is enumerated or not. If it is then calculate the `log_prob` of the shape of `(duration,states,states,...)` which later can be used with `MarkovProduct`. Is this approach feasible?\r\n\r\n### Code Snippet\r\n```py\r\nclass MarkovianCategorical(TorchDistribution):\r\n    def __init__(self, initial_logits, transition_logits, duration,
