the next major release, we can incorporate some of the lessons from numpyro and issues from our forum, to improve the HMC interface as follows:\r\n - [ ] Provide a `potential_fn` like in numpyro so that users do not necessarily need to pass in their model, but can generate samples from any callable whose `log_density` can be evaluated. This will be useful for integrating with `funsors`, and eventually getting rid of our `TraceTreeEvaluator` wrappers. https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/123\r\n - [ ] If an initial trace is provided, we should make sure that we do not ever run the model to set up our initial state. This is important because many a time we want to sample from distributions which do not have a `sample` method defined. We should still be able to run HMC on such models.\r\n - [ ] Related to the points above, it will be nice if (just like in numpyro) once given a `potential_fn` and `initial_sample` we can generate subsequent samples, without having to make any assumptions about the container data structure. Right now, we assume that this container data structure is a Pyro trace object, but this is only needed to interface with the `TracePosterior` class. This will make it really simple to integrate NUTS/HMC into other libraries. I think a middle ground might be to move the trace wrapping/unwrapping logic into the MCMC class, but more discussion is needed.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: Refactoring the `TracePosterior` interface. #1725 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/1816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/1816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
