is an implementation of autodiff. The goal is to address issues in computing expectations in `TraceEnum_ELBO` and `TraceMarkovEnum_ELBO` (#493). As of now it seems to fix `nan` gradients under `eager` interpretation in `TraceEnum_ELBO`.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm implements equivalents of `linearize()`, `transpose()` functions, and is tape-free (#446). \r\n\r\n1. **Linearize.** Variables that need to be linearized are replaced by primal- tangent tuple `JVP(primal, tangent)` and then pattern matched to propagate tangents, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nJVP(x, dx) + JVP(y, dy) = JVP(x+y, dx+dy)\r\nJVP(x, dx) * JVP(y, dy) = JVP(x*y, ydx + xdy)\r\nJVP(x, dx) * y = JVP(x*y, ydx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOut tangent is a linear function of in tangents. `JVP` is used for `(add,mul)` semiring and `LJVP` is used for `(logaddexp,add)` semiring.\r\n\r\n2. **Transpose of a linear function.** Transpose is implemented simply by inverting the order of function execution and transposing matrices, in this case swapping more primitive operations `.reduce(sum_op, \"i\")` and `.expand(\"i\")` (broadcasting does this
