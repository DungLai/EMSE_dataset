PR attempts to make Tensor backend agnostic, which will subsume efforts to write non-numeric code for each backend. In principle, we only require adding dispatches to numeric ops for a new backend.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] fork `funsor.torch.Tensor` to a new class `tensor.Tensor` and change all torch ops to funsor.ops\r\n\r\n- [x] fork all eager op on `funsor.torch.Tensor` to `tensor.Tensor`\r\n\r\n- [x] add tests for the change\r\n\r\n- [x] remove unnecessary code in `torch.py`, `numpy.py`; only keep dispatching implementation on those files\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix `test_arange_simple`\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix a weird bug of at the assertation `assert type(actual) == type(expected)`, where actual and expected are two `Tensor`s with numpy scalar data.\r\n\r\n- [x] Update tensor docs\r\n\r\n### Future PRs\r\n\r\n- add backend-agnostic tests to `test_gaussian`.\r\n- create `torch` and `numpy` folders that hold implementations of dispatching numeric ops and dispatching distributions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/303/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/303/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/604053463","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/308#issuecomment-604053463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/308","id":604053463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDA1MzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-25T19:56:31Z","updated_at":"2020-03-25T19:56:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fehiepsi
