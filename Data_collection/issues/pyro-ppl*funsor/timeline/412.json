https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/412\r\nRequires https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50547 and https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50581\r\n\r\nThis adds a `TorchDistribution.infer_shapes()` method to statically compute `(batch_shape, event_shape)` for use in Funsor. This method inputs `*args,**kwargs` with the same signature as `.__init__()` but inputting shapes rather than tensors. The following should be equivalent:\r\n```py\r\n# Eager version.\r\nd = MultivariateNormal(loc, covariance_matrix)\r\nbatch_shape = d.batch_shape\r\nevent_shape = d.event_shape\r\n\r\n# Lazy version.\r\nbatch_shape, event_shape = MultivariateNormal.infer_shapes(loc.shape, covariance_matrix.shape)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default implementation uses new `.support.event_dim` logic from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50547, so I've included backports in this PR (we can delete next time PyTorch is released).\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] unit tests for `.support.is_discrete`\r\n-

https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/412\r\nPorts `.infer_shape()` from https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2739\r\nPorts `dependent_property` from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50581\r\n\r\nThis adds a static method `Disribution.infer_shapes()` to statically infer `(batch_shape, event_shape)` from the shapes of distribution parameters. This should speed up funsor computations as described in https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/412. Note this works for only a subset of distributions; shapes cannot currently be statically inferred for distributions with non-tensor inputs such as `TransformedDistribution` which takes a distribution, or `Delta` which takes an `event_dim: int`.\r\n\r\nThis generic logic requires static `.event_dim` attributes on dependent supports. Because NumPyro uses `Constraint.__call__()` rather than `Constraint.check()` I've added a type check to determine behavior in `_Dependent.__call__()`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] added a unit test to test_distributions.py","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/numpyro/issues/901/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/numpyro/issues/901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/784281646","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/412#issuecomment-784281646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/412","id":784281646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDI4MTY0Ng==","user":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-23T15:25:57Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T15:25:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Now that https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2739 has landed, what's left to do on the Funsor side?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/784281646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/784285834","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/412#issuecomment-784285834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/412","id":784285834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDI4NTgzNA==","user":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-23T15:31:28Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T15:32:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it's safe to close this.
