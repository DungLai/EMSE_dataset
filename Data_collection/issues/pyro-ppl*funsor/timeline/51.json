by #51 ~~\r\n\r\nIt appears that the simplest way to implement an inference strategy is via a `Joint` funsor that keeps track of various `Tensor`, `Gaussian`, and `Delta` factors in a canonical,

Its denotational semantics are defined by its `.eager_subs()` method, and its operational semantics are defined by the transition operations we call on `Joint` objects during inference:\r\n- `+=` a log prob term with either a lazy or eager value\r\n- `.reduce(ops.logaddexp, -)` out variables when they are no longer live\r\n- `.reduce(ops.sample, -)` variables when they need a ground value (e.g.
