introduced a `poutine.collapse()` effect in https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2620, allowing exact conjugate inference over blocks of code, similar to @neerajprad's [pyro.contrib.conjugate](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/dev/pyro/contrib/conjugate/infer.py).\r\n\r\n@fehiepsi I think this would be an edifying intro to using Funsor for general pattern matching. Once `poutine.collapse()` is implemented in NumPyro, we can add [new conjugacy patterns](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/367) to Funsor. Currently I believe only Beta-Binomial and Gaussian-Gaussian are implemented. I think some good starter Funsor tasks would be implementing patterns for say Beta-Bernoulli and then patterns for plates, as in Beta-plated(Binomial).\r\n\r\ncc @eb8680 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/numpyro/issues/756/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/numpyro/issues/756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3837012966,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzODM3MDEyOTY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/3837012966","actor":{"login":"fehiepsi","id":4736342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi","html_url":"https://github.com/fehiepsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-03T22:17:27Z","assignee":{"login":"fehiepsi","id":4736342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi","html_url":"https://github.com/fehiepsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/703171531","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/367#issuecomment-703171531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/367","id":703171531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzE3MTUzMQ==","user":{"login":"fehiepsi","id":4736342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi","html_url":"https://github.com/fehiepsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehiepsi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-03T22:19:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10-03T22:19:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This looks interesting and helpful to understand those `eager.register` logics in `distributions`.

Currently, pyro.collapse will return a string at Gamma site, so I am not sure what is the user code to exploit conjugacy for this relation. I think in principle, this is possible if instead of returning a string, we return a

`pyro.sample` statements to return `funsor.Variable`s rather than strings.
