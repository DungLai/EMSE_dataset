#177 \r\n\r\nThis adds a basic `FunsorDistribution` class inheriting from `TorchDistribution`. The class is intended to wrap a `Funsor` as a `Distribution` object for use in Pyro.\r\n\r\nI've created a new module `funsor.pyro` and I plan to create new submodules like `funsor.pyro.hmm` #171 containing various hidden-markov models (discrete, gaussian, slds, ...). Each of these distributions will use fancy funsor syntax internally, but will expose their inference algorithms as black-box `Distributions` with `.sample()` and `.log_prob()` methods. These distributions should be fully compatible with broadcasting, plates, and enumeration dims (which should pass right through these algorithms).\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- added unit tests for

issue tracks changes needed to fully support multiple backends in an interchangeable/generic way. The initial release of Funsor implements most funsors using PyTorch (funsor.torch implements `Tensor`, but all of funsor.gaussian, .joint, .distributions use PyTorch internally.\r\n\r\n## Approach 1\r\nOne possibility is to replicate backend-specific logic in a consistent way, e.g. with module structure\r\n- funsor\r\n  - torch\r\n    - tensor\r\n    - gaussian\r\n    - cnf\r\n    - distributions\r\n  - numpy / jax\r\n    - tensor\r\n    - gaussian\r\n    - cnf\r\n    - distributions\r\n  - tensorflow\r\n    - ...\r\n  - birch\r\n    - ...\r\n\r\n## Approach 2\r\nA second possibility (suggested by @eb8680 below and in #159) is to\r\n1. subclass `Tensor` into `TorchTensor` and `NumpyTensor`, then\r\n2. refactor `Gaussian` and `Contraction` etc. to use `Tensor`s rather than torch.Tensors internally.\r\n\r\nThis approach would still require duplicating distributions.\r\n\r\n## Potential backends\r\n- [x] PyTorch / `pyro.distributions`\r\n- [x] #58 NumPy\r\n- [x] JAX / `numpyro.distributions`\r\n- [ ] Tensorflow 2.0 / `tfp.distributions`\r\n- [ ] Trax's TensorFlow-backed NumPy API [`tf_numpy`](https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/tf_numpy)\r\n- [ ] Birch \r\n\r\n## Other tasks\r\n- [ ] Remove stray dependencies on PyTorch or NumPy e.g. in `funsor.testing` and `funsor.domains`\r\n- [x] Add backend-specific installation options `funsor[torch]`, `funsor[numpy]`
