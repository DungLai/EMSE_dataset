#145 \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a simple stack-based interpreter as a drop-in replacement for `funsor.interpreter.reinterpret`, so that it's possible to evaluate arbitrarily large deferred expressions that would otherwise exceed the Python interpreter's maximum recursion depth.  \r\n\r\nThe new interpreter is 2-3x slower than the current recursion-based one since it's using Python data structures, so I've also left the current interpreter in as the default.\r\n\r\nThe new interpreter is accessible via an environment variable `FUNSOR_USE_TCO=1`:\r\n```\r\n# fails with a RecursionError\r\npython examples/kalman_filter.py -n 2 -t 500 --lazy\r\n\r\n# this works\r\nFUNSOR_USE_TCO=1 python examples/kalman_filter.py -n 2 -t 500 --lazy\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested: exercised by running existing tests with `FUNSOR_USE_TCO=1`, and by running existing examples with longer time

`funsor.torch` provides a PyTorch backend via `Tensor`, `@function` and a few other helpers. It should be straight-forward to provide similar adaptors for numy and jax., say as a new module `funsor.numpy` and class `Array`.\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\n- [x] #74 support numpy in `pyro.ops`. e.g. we will need to call `np.log(x)` rather than `x.log()` based on type.\r\n- [x] implement an `align_arrays` function similar to `align_tensors`\r\n- [x] implement a `funsor.numpy.Array` class\r\n- [x] register `np.array` with `to_funsor`\r\n- [x] fork `test_torch.py` to a new `test_numpy.py`\r\n- [x] Add compatibility with tail-call optimized interpreter from #145 and remove conditional xfail added to `test_numpy.py` added in #155 \r\n- [x] implement `Array.eager_reduce()`\r\n- [x] optionally add a `Function` wrapper and `@funsor.numpy.function` decorator\r\n- [x] refactor (`Tensor`,`Array`) to share a superclass, e.g. `Tensor` -> {`TorchTensor`, `NumpyTensor`)\r\n- [x] refactor `Gaussian` to `Tensor` rather than torch.Tensor internally.\r\n    This requires wrapping many linear algebra operations as functions, e.g. `cholesky_solve`.\r\n- [x] Make unary ops work with Array input. (#303)\r\n- [ ] Enable `test_tensor.py` with FUNSOR_USE_TCO=1\r\n- [x] Support numpy docstring in `funsor.util.getargspec`\r\n- [x] Add numpy backend tests for `test_gaussian`.\r\n- [x] Add numpy backend for `einsum`.\r\n- [ ] Consider disabling some of the overhead caused by `normalize`.\r\n- [x] Make `funsor.distributions` backend-agnostic\r\n- [x] Add support for `jax.numpy`.\r\n- [ ] update `funsor.minipyro` to support numpy backend\r\n- [x] add inference examples using numpy\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
