#110 \r\nAddresses #90 \r\nPair coded with @martinjankowiak \r\n\r\nThis adds a `moment_matching` interpretation of `Joint.reduce(ops.logaddexp, -)` to allow projection of a Gaussian mixture to a single Gaussian (per remaining free variable).\r\n\r\nThis also adds a Switching Linear Dynamicsl System example that exercises the new approximation.\r\n\r\nNote @eb8680 this also adds a distributivity rule to the eager interpretation, which appears to be needed if we represent mixture models as lazy reductions. This rule may overlap with `distribute` in the optimizer, but I haven't simplified in this PR.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- [x] unit test for one-dimensional gaussian\r\n- [x] unit test for multivariate gaussian\r\n- [x] unit tests for mismatched int inputs of `.discrete`, `.gaussian`\r\n- [x] added examples/slds.py to Makefile","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2256463897,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI1NjQ2Mzg5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2256463897","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-05T17:30:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
