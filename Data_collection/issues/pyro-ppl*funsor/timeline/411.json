`funsor.torch` provides a PyTorch backend via `Tensor`, `@function` and a few other helpers. It should be straight-forward to provide similar adaptors for numy and jax., say as a new module `funsor.numpy` and class `Array`.\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\n- [x] #74 support numpy in `pyro.ops`. e.g. we will need to call `np.log(x)` rather than `x.log()` based on type.\r\n- [x] implement an `align_arrays` function similar to `align_tensors`\r\n- [x] implement a `funsor.numpy.Array` class\r\n- [x] register `np.array` with `to_funsor`\r\n- [x] fork `test_torch.py` to a new `test_numpy.py`\r\n- [x] Add compatibility with tail-call optimized interpreter from #145 and remove conditional xfail added to `test_numpy.py` added in #155 \r\n- [x] implement `Array.eager_reduce()`\r\n- [x] optionally add a `Function` wrapper and `@funsor.numpy.function` decorator\r\n- [x] refactor (`Tensor`,`Array`) to share a superclass, e.g. `Tensor` -> {`TorchTensor`, `NumpyTensor`)\r\n- [x] refactor `Gaussian` to `Tensor` rather than torch.Tensor internally.\r\n    This requires wrapping many linear algebra operations as functions, e.g. `cholesky_solve`.\r\n- [x] Make unary ops work with Array input. (#303)\r\n- [ ] Enable `test_tensor.py` with FUNSOR_USE_TCO=1\r\n- [x] Support numpy docstring in `funsor.util.getargspec`\r\n- [x] Add numpy backend tests for `test_gaussian`.\r\n- [x] Add numpy backend for `einsum`.\r\n- [ ] Consider disabling some of the overhead caused by `normalize`.\r\n- [x] Make `funsor.distributions` backend-agnostic\r\n- [x] Add support for `jax.numpy`.\r\n- [ ] update `funsor.minipyro` to support numpy backend\r\n- [x] add inference examples using numpy\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-23T15:39:00Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T15:39:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/463","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/463/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/463/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/463/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/463","id":812479079,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc2ODM4MzIw","number":463,"title":"Add
