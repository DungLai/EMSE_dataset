#228 \r\n\r\nThis adds `MarkovProduct` as a lazy `sequential_sum_product()`. Changes include:\r\n- Refactor `sequential_sum_product()` to input `time` as a `Variable` rather than string\r\n  (for the same reason as #233 ).\r\n- Refactor `GaussianHMM` and `GaussianMRF` to use `MarkovProduct`. Note that `DiscreteHMM` cannot be converted until we allow `bint()` domains with nontrivial shape.\r\n- Fixed some docs.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- added `MarkovProduct` cases to test_sum_product.py\r\n- `GaussianHMM` and `GaussianMRF` refactoring is covered by test/pyro/test_hmm.py\r\n- updated test/examples/test_bart.py to use `MarkovProduct`\r\n- ran `make docs`
