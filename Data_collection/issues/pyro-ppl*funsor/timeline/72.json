#156 by adding two things:\r\n1. A `Contraction` term representing finitary sum-product operations that takes advantage of `multipledispatch.Variadic` for pattern matching.  This is also necessary for #72.\r\n2. A `normalize` interpretation that uses associative and distributive properties to put linear expressions into something like DNF, grouping operations into single `Contraction` terms where possible.\r\n\r\nAs a demonstration, I have included patterns and tests illustrating how `Joint` is equivalent to interleaving `eager` and `normalize`.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- I copied smoke tests and test cases verbatim from `test_joint.py`, `test_gaussian.py`, `test_affine.py` and `test_einsum.py`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/157/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2481024477,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNDgxMDI0NDc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2481024477","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-13T23:56:45Z","assignee":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T00:42:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T00:42:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/173","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/173/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/173/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/173/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/pull/173","id":472603921,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzAwOTM1NTY1","number":173,"title":"Refactor

with @fritzo \r\n\r\n~~Blocked by #72~~\r\n\r\nThis adds an example using exact Gaussian sensor fusion to estimate sensor bias in a multi-sensor single-object tracking problem. Right now the numbers in the paper is using random acceleration model.  It also is doing manual sequential sum product rather than GaussianHMM (missing pattern) or `sequential_sum_product()` (todo).  The probabilistic model is\r\n```py\r\nprocess_noise = pyro.param(...)\r\nsensor_noise = pyro.param(...)\r\nbias_scale = pyro.param(...)\r\n\r\nwith plate(\"sensors\", num_sensors):\r\n    bias ~
