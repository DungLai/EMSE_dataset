biggest single issue blocking wider use of Funsor in Pyro and NumPyro right now is the incomplete coverage of distributions.  \r\n\r\nAt a high level, the goal is to be able to perform all distribution operations that appear in any Pyro or NumPyro model (e.g. sampling and scoring) on Funsors directly, where distribution funsors are obtained from using `to_funsor` to automatically convert distributions to Funsors initially and using `funsor.to_data` to automatically convert the final results back to raw PyTorch/JAX objects.  Wherever possible, the Funsor wrappers should also avoid the need for user-facing higher-order distributions, such as `Independent` or `TransformedDistribution`, in favor of idiomatic Funsor operations or broadcasting semantics.\r\n\r\nWe have gotten pretty far with the generic wrappers in `funsor.distribution` and `funsor.{jax,torch}.distributions`, but finishing the job and achieving full coverage of `pyro.distributions` remains a challenge because of the large distribution API and number of distributions, many small impedance mismatches and legacy design choices in PyTorch (e.g. the data type of `Bernoulli`), and difficulty of programmatic access and automation (e.g. no generic tool for constructing random valid instances of a distribution given a `batch_shape`).\r\n\r\nI've tried to collect the remaining Funsor-specific tasks in this issue so that we can better measure progress toward this goal.  We may also need to do additional work upstream in Pyro, NumPyro or PyTorch distributions.\r\n\r\nTransforms and `TransformedDistribution`s (some design discussion in #309):\r\n- [x] #387 Near-complete coverage of parameter-free invertible `Transform`s in Pyro\r\n- [x] #365 Basic conversion of `TransformedDistribution`s to and from `funsor.Distributions` on the PyTorch backend\r\n- [x] #427 Automatic wrapping of non-batched `Transform`s\r\n- [ ] Conversion of `TransformedDistribution`s to and from funsors on the JAX backend (can copy #365)\r\n- [ ] Coverage for distribution conversion with non-invertible `Transform`s like `AbsTransform`\r\n- [ ] Coverage for conversion of invertible `Transform`s with *ground* parameters, notably `AffineTransform` and `PowerTransform` with `batch_shape == ()`\r\n- [ ] Coverage for conversion of invertible `Transform` with *non-ground* parameters, e.g. `AffineTransform` with `len(batch_shape) > 0`\r\n- [ ] Wrappers for `ConditionalTransform`s and `TransformedModule`s in Pyro/PyTorch\r\n\r\nOther basic distribution modifiers:\r\n- [x] #391 automated `to_funsor` conversion for custom distributions\r\n- [x] #394 Near-full coverage of basic distributions (easy enough to implement; the difficulty is testing and fixing PyTorch bugs)\r\n- [x] #394 Get backend `Delta` conversion working\r\n- [x] #396 Converting `funsor.Independent` to and from `Independent` distributions\r\n- [x] #402 more idiomatic support for `Independent` distributions in Funsor\r\n- [x] #418 Converting lazy Pyro `ExpandedDistribution`s to funsors\r\n- [x] #419 Converting lazy Numpyro `ExpandedDistribution`s to funsors\r\n- [x] #432 Handle conversion of parameters with `_IndependentConstraint` `arg_constraints`\r\n- [x] #443 Convert `IndependentDistribution`s directly to base Funsor distributions\r\n- [ ] Support for converting mixture distributions into funsor sum-product expressions, e.g. `MaskedMixture` and `MixtureSameFamily`\r\n\r\nMasking:\r\n- [ ] First-class support for masking using logical operations rather than floats\r\n- [ ] Optimized handling for scalar masks (i.e. the case `mask is False`) (discussed in #459)\r\n\r\nDirect TFP distribution wrappers:\r\n- [ ] Direct wrapping of TFP distributions in the JAX backend - this would probably involve a new subclass `class TFPDistribution(funsor.distribution.Distribution)` with TFP-specific implementations of `_infer_value_domain` and `_infer_param_domain`\r\n- [ ] Direct TFP `Bijector` wrappers\r\n\r\nAtomic distribution computations beyond sampling and scoring implemented in the backend libraries:\r\n- [x] #388 Entropy (discussed in #374)\r\n- [x] #388 Mean (`TorchDistribution.mean`)\r\n- [x] #388 Variance (`TorchDistribution.variance`)\r\n- [ ] KL divergence (discussed in #374)\r\n\r\nTest harnesses for distribution wrappers (testing correctness of underlying distribution functionality here is out of scope - we are mostly interested in ensuring that results are converted to Funsors correctly):\r\n- [x] #389 conversion with `to_funsor` and `to_data`\r\n- [x] #389 types and shapes\r\n- [x] #389 densities\r\n- [x] #389 enumeration (`enumerate_support`)\r\n- [x] #389 samplers\r\n- [ ] transforms\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n- [ ] Find a workaround for int/float casting issues in `Bernoulli` (discussed in #348)\r\n- [ ] Generic support for sampling via `Funsor.sample()` in `funsor.pyro.FunsorDistribution` - done properly, this may eliminate the need for first-class conjugate distribution implementations in backends, e.g. `DirichletMultinomial`\r\n\r\nLower priority, possibly unnecessary:\r\n- [conjugate_update](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/distributions.html#pyro.distributions.Distribution.conjugate_update) wrapper (may be unnecessary?)\r\n- #395 Monte Carlo tests for samplers and their gradients (low priority)\r\n- Some Funsor analogue of `Distribution.expand()` e.g. via lazy units as in #235 or substitution of indexed `Variable` terms (`f(v=v['i'])`)\r\n- Generic tests for conjugate distribution pairs\r\n- deprecate existing, case-by-case tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/386/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
