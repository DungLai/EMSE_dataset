op implementations are opaque to Funsor and are only invoked on ... data\r\n\r\nI seems more natural to me to extend Python's builtin `operator` library by letting e.g. `ops.add` apply to funsors. That way we can use Python idiomatic syntax to describe both data and funsors. A simple fix for `logaddexp` is to add `.__logaddexp__()` method handling as in #306; we did the same thing for `.__matmul__` in Python 2 before it was standardized in Python 3. Generally it seems natural to let `ops` strictly extend `operator` by (1) adding more structure (as proposed in this issue), and (2) adding more ops.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/578885236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4207231260,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDIwNzIzMTI2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/4207231260","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-14T16:57:33Z","rename":{"from":"Strengthen organization of funsor.ops and related code","to":"Strengthen algebraic organization of funsor.ops and related code"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
