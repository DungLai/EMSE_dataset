PR adds an updated version of the old opt_einsum optimizer and tests it against the existing `test_einsum` tests.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Rewrite `Binary` ops to `Finitary`\r\n- [x] Exploit associativity of `Finitary` ops\r\n- [x] Exploit associativity of `Reduce` ops\r\n- [x] Exploit distributivity for `Reduce` and `Finitary`\r\n- [x] Support multiple semirings\r\n- [x] Support distributivity in mixed terms like `Finitary(Reduce, Finitary)`\r\n- [x] Add HMM-style test cases that only work with optimization enabled\r\n- [x] Add more tests that exercise edge cases\r\n\r\nTriaged:\r\n- Distribute `Finitary` ops over one another (no optimizer for this currently)\r\n- Implement tensor variable elimination #9 \r\n- Handle variable name collisons correctly throughout the optimizer instead of assuming global

#9 \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the evaluation of pairwise contractions in the optimizer.  Previously the path produced by `opt_einsum` was being interpreted incorrectly, causing optimized evaluation to evaluate the wrong pairs of contractions and produce exponentially large intermediate results.  As a demonstration, I added some large plated HMM contractions to `test_optimizer.py` that would run out of memory without this fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/47/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2183101354,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIxODMxMDEzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2183101354","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-06T05:35:23Z","milestone":{"title":"Initial examples"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2184883224,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE4NDg4MzIyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2184883224","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-06T17:40:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
