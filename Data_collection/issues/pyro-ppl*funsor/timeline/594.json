encountered a subtle problem when sampling from the posterior predictive distribution for a model containing `Categorical` and using the `AutoDiagonalNormal`: In some rare cases, the sample drawn from the `Categorical` would be one large than the maximum category index. E.g., a model like\r\n```\r\ndef model(num_categories):\r\n    sample(\"ps\", Dirichlet(jnp.ones(num_categories)))\r\n    sample(\"x\", Categorical(probs=ps))\r\n```\r\nmay sample a value of `num_categories` even though the support of the categorical distribution is `(0, ..., num_categories-1)`.\r\n\r\nThis seems to arise from the combination of\r\n- `numpyro.distributions.util._categorical` (and hence `numpyro.distributions.CategoricalProbs`) [expecting the passed probability vector to sum up exactly to one](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro/blob/1dbe63f72f1cd8befb76d0b8e7b4f284e7852404/numpyro/distributions/util.py#L187)\r\n- `AutoDiagonalNormal` (or probably rather the `StickBreakingTransform`) not guaranteeing that due to numerical imprecision\r\n\r\nWe observed samples from the `AutoDiagonalNormal` guide for which the probability vector `ps` summed up to something just shy of one. In rare cases, the uniform (0,1) sample used in `numpyro.distributions.util._categorical` falls above the total sum, resulting in the function to return the largest category index plus one as a value.\r\n\r\nOur current quick-and-dirty workaround for this is to simply clamp the sampled values to the support but surely there are better ways of handling this, but I haven't given it much thought. Naively it would seem that explicit renormalisation of the probability vector at some point would be the way to go, but I'm not sure that will actually be robust towards the numerical issues that seem to lead to this in the first place..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/numpyro/issues/1402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/numpyro/issues/1402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/1153374595","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/594#issuecomment-1153374595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/594","id":1153374595,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCgoJts5EvxmD","user":{"login":"ordabayevy","id":50752571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50752571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy","html_url":"https://github.com/ordabayevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-13T01:51:04Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T01:51:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed via https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro/pull/1419","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/1153374595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ordabayevy","id":50752571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50752571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy","html_url":"https://github.com/ordabayevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6792381224,"node_id":"CE_lADOCgoJts5JIQoOzwAAAAGU24Mo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/6792381224","actor":{"login":"ordabayevy","id":50752571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50752571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy","html_url":"https://github.com/ordabayevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-13T01:51:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
