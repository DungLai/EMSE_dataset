#124.  Resolves #164.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `funsor.adjoint` to be compatible with alpha-renaming and adds support for separate forward and backward interpretations, enabling use cases like Viterbi decoding and forward filtering/backward sampling algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe interface has changed somewhat - now the user explicitly creates a tape and records the forward computation, then separately calls `adjoint` to run the backward computation:\r\n```py\r\nwith interpretation(some_interpretation), AdjointTape() as tape:\r\n    y = do_some_stuff(targets)\r\n\r\nwith interpretation(another_interpretation):\r\n    adjoints = tape.adjoint(ops.logaddexp, ops.add, y, targets)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/197/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2563681442,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjU2MzY4MTQ0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2563681442","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T00:31:24Z","label":{"name":"Blocked","color":"e99695"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/542938234","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/124#issuecomment-542938234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/124","id":542938234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjkzODIzNA==","user":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T23:56:14Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T23:56:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@eb8680 is this already completed?
