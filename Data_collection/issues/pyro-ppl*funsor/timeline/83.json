#83 \r\n\r\nThis adds support for PyTorch builtin functions to `funsor.torch.function`. Before this PR `function(reals(2,3), reals(3,4), reals(2,4))(torch.matmul)` would fail due to [cpython limitations](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/inspect.html#inspect.signature). However PyTorch functions contain name metadata in the standardized `.__doc__` attribute. This PR falls back to attempting to extract arg names from the docstring.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- added a unit
