as we discussed today, Funsor is currently incorrect when evaluating discrete+continuous mixtures. One possible solution path is to generalize log density to nonstandard reals, either by an `Infinite` funsor or by adding funsor metadata in the form of an integer attribute `.order` that propagates up to enclosing funsors. Semantically, only the highest-order terms are maintained. This `.order` can be seen as the power of the unit infinite number in nonstandard analysis.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/527622880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2604864481,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYwNDg2NDQ4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2604864481","actor":{"login":"martinjankowiak","id":22105218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTA1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22105218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak","html_url":"https://github.com/martinjankowiak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-03T20:19:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2604864482,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MDQ4NjQ0ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/2604864482","actor":{"login":"martinjankowiak","id":22105218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTA1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22105218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak","html_url":"https://github.com/martinjankowiak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-03T20:19:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/527656711","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/53#issuecomment-527656711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/53","id":527656711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzY1NjcxMQ==","user":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T21:57:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T22:39:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"On

the method `Funsor.reduce(op, vars)` requires a set of strings. This design choice forces `.reduce()` to require all vars to appear in the `.inputs` of the funsor being reduced. If instead we required `.reduce()` to input `Variables` (as requested in #211 ), then those variables would have sufficient type metadata to allow reduction over constant terms: for `bint()` reduction variables we would multiply by `var.output.size`, and for `real()` variables we could either do nothing (now) or later multiply by the unit infinite as suggested in #53 .\r\n\r\nOne advantage of this refactoring is that funsors could drop trivial inputs of type `bint(1)`.\r\n\r\nNote following #211 we could still allow string inputs, but raise say a `TypeError` if there is insufficient type metadata to convert all strings to `Variables` (i.e. if any reduction variable does not appear free in the term being reduced). This would ensure backward compatibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/233/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
