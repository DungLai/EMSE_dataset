#362 \r\n\r\nThis splits the `funsor.ops` module into three submodules:\r\n- `ops.op` for `Op` base classes and registries\r\n- `ops.builtin` for python builtin operations\r\n- `ops.array` for numpy-like array functions  (mostly authored by @fehiepsi)\r\n\r\nThese boundaries are best-effort and will likely change a bit in the future, e.g.\r\n- some numeric ops could be moved between `builtin` and `array`\r\n- I'd prefer to avoid using `numpy` in `ops.builtin`\r\n- some op classes could move from `ops.builtin` to `ops.op`\r\n\r\nThis also slightly changes the `Op` interface to eliminate direct need to use `Dispatcher` for array ops without default behavior; hopefully this will allow increased use of `Op` for pattern matching, but let me know if I've misunderstood.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- built docs

#362, #207, https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/2630\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to resolve cyclic dependency issues that are preventing Pyro from depending on `funsor`. The underlying issue is that `funsor.torch` depends on Pyro for distributions and some math helpers, but we would like Pyro to be able to depend on Funsor. This cyclic dependency is an issue because `funsor.torch` calls `import pyro` and then `pyro` calls `import funsor`. This PR resolves the issue by delaying backend-specific module loading until `set_backend()` is called, so that Pyro can `import funsor` without any Pyro dependencies. Then once `pyro` is fully loaded, Pyro code that uses Funsor can call `funsor.set_backend(\"torch\")` as needed, triggering full loading of `funsor.torch`.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the backend configuration\r\n```py\r\nset_backend(os.environ.get(\"FUNSOR_BACKEND\", \"numpy\"))\r\n```\r\nfrom `funsor/__init__.py` to `test/conftest.py`. After this PR, the `FUNSOR_BACKEND` environment variable is no longer part of the public interface; instead it merely controls pytest testing. Henceforth all examples explicitly call `set_backend(\"torch\")`; in the future we may also make the examples more generic and read backend from an environment variable.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/749276746","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/362#issuecomment-749276746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/362","id":749276746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTI3Njc0Ng==","user":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-22T00:51:54Z","updated_at":"2020-12-22T00:51:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed by #363","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/749276746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4138141376,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDEzODE0MTM3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/4138141376","actor":{"login":"fritzo","id":648532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/648532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo","html_url":"https://github.com/fritzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fritzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-22T00:51:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
