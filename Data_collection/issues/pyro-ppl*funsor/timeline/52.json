by #51 ~~\r\n\r\nIt appears that the simplest way to implement an inference strategy is via a `Joint` funsor that keeps track of various `Tensor`, `Gaussian`, and `Delta` factors in a canonical, searchable data structure. This `Joint` object is really a state machine / interpreter disguised as a Funsor. Its denotational semantics are defined by its `.eager_subs()` method, and its operational semantics are defined by the transition operations we call on `Joint` objects during inference:\r\n- `+=` a log prob term with either a lazy or eager value\r\n- `.reduce(ops.logaddexp, -)` out variables when they are no longer live\r\n- `.reduce(ops.sample, -)` variables when they need a ground value (e.g. for control flow)\r\n- `.reduce(ops.add, -)` out plates when they are complete (see log_joint in minipyro.py)\r\n\r\nNote that this can be sensibly implemented even before we implement sampling #52

#52 \r\n\r\nThis implements a low-level `Funsor.sample()` method that will be used in Monte Carlo approximation. This method returns a funsor of the same shape as the original funsor, indeed an unbiased estimator of the original funsor, in value and all derivatives. Samples are encoded as `Delta` distributions, and differentiability is achieved by either reparametrization (for `Gaussian`) or multiplying by Dice factors (for discrete samples of `Tensor`). Sampling from a `Delta` is a no-op. Multiple samples can be drawn by passing in a `sample_inputs`, analogous to the `sample_shape` of torch.distributions.\r\n\r\nNote that `Distribution` objects do not implement `.sample()` because the only way we could draw samples would be with materialized tensors, and all current `Distribution` objects eagerly convert to other funsors (`Categorical` -> `Tensor`, `Normal` -> `Gaussian`, ...), and it is those other funsors that implement `.sample()` methods.\r\n\r\nThis PR also deletes the unused `ops.sample` and `ops.marginal` because we seem to be implementing that functionality elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- [x] I would have preferred the multiple sample result to be wrapped in a lazy `Reduce()` so as to maintain the property of unbiased estimation, however our current eager `Reduce()` semantics would unbind the resulting funsor and convert to a deeply nested `Binary()`. Suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] Implement `Tensor.sample()`\r\n- [x] Implement `Gaussian.sample()`\r\n- [x] Implement `Delta.sample()`\r\n- [x] Implement `Joint.sample()`\r\n- [x] test
