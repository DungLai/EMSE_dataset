Then we could write e.g.\r\n```py\r\n@make_funsor\r\ndef Mean(\r\n    X: Funsor,\r\n    axes: BoundSet\r\n) -> Fresh[lambda X: X]:\r\n    return X.reduce(ops.add, axes) / reduce(ops.mul, [ax.output.size for ax in axes])","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/comments/792370166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4418602885,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ0MTg2MDI4ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/events/4418602885","actor":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-07T23:02:06Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"fef2c0"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
