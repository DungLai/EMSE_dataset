For windows, you'll have to resolve all the dependencies; it may be hard so I recommend you to do it on Linux or more preferably Ubuntu. \r\n\r\nBut the above two errors are not because of that. The first error is because you are running the command from the `python` folder. So there is no more `python` folder inside of it. So you have to remove `python` as you did. \r\n\r\nNow it cannot recognize the module `iterators` but a simple `cd` will show that it is present.
