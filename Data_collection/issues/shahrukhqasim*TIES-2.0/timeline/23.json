If I save it as model.ckpt-1 , I get the `ValueError: The passed save_path is not a valid checkpoint` error. Am not sure what the issue is except links pointing to the session run setup, and that the name of the checkerpoint has to be compatible with the name of model and as we dont have a model yet, the checkpoint isnot created correctly.\r\n\r\nany and all help is appreciated, will be providing v2 compatible of your code once/if I fix this
