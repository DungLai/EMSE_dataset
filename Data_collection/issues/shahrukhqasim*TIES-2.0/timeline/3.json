I will do it soon. However, you can use the other repository (linked) to generate it. In addition to this, this repository is only made to work on the synthetic dataset on which it is trained. It won't generalize to other examples unless you have a dataset of them to train on. It is more for research purposes.\r\n\r\nI saw you created more issues. I will reply to them soon (probably by tonight) as we get free.\r\n\r\nAnd you are welcome for the repository. I'll try to resolve and reply on all the issues but I may take some time.
