I solved this by placing the file **table_adjacency_parsing.py** at the root of the project.\r\n\r\nExcellent! But when I ran the command again it showed me the following warnings\r\n``WARNING:tensorflow: From table_adjacency_parsing_iterator.py:73: start_queue_runners (from tensorflow.python.training.queue_runner_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\r\nInstructions for updating:\r\nTo construct input pipelines, use the 'tf.data' module.\r\nWARNING:tensorflow:'tf.train.start_queue_runners()' was called when no queue runners were defined. You can safely remove the call to this deprecated function.``\r\n\r\nOk, i need to update the tensorflow method, but where is the graph keys (to update the deprecated function) and why this is happening?\r\n\r\n### Specs\r\n* Windows 10\r\n* nvidia mx110 (v√≠deo card)\r\n* I7 8th Gen\r\n* 8GB Ram\r\n* Python 3.6 :: Anaconda, Inc.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shahrukhqasim/TIES-2.0/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shahrukhqasim/TIES-2.0/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
