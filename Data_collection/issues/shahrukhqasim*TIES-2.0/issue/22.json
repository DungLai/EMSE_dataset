I tried to train the model by tf-record downloaded from google drive you provided. Used the same tfrecord for train, val and test. \r\nFor the training process, loss converged quickly, after 2000 iterations, I got the result as below:\r\nTraining Iteration 1999:\r\nAccuracy - cells: 0.999771655 rows: 1 cols: 0.999677658\r\n Loss     - cells: 0.00083513 rows: 0.00029534733 cols: 0.00229700166\r\n Fraction - cells: 0.503221631 rows: 0.493117601 cols: 0.492601216\r\n Total loss: 0.00114249298\r\n\r\nBut when I checked the visual feedbacks, I got poor visualized result :\r\n<img width=\"552\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2019-10-30 上午11 03 38\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23485433/67825686-1d825600-fb05-11e9-9294-c2ebb8b263b1.png\">\r\n<img width=\"572\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2019-10-30 上午11 03 54\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23485433/67825690-1f4c1980-fb05-11e9-8c93-bdb5fe7c44f6.png\">\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have some advice or have similar problems?
