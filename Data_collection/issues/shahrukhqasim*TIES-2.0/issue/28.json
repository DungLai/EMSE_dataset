I am now concentrating on the problem of table recognition, and learn a lot from your paper and code. It's really kind of you for sharing your code and giving detailed description.\r\nBy contrasting the paper and code, I found that the part of the evaluation doesn't exist in the project, and I am frustrated when converting the three adjacency matrices(cell, row, column) into the final results. Could you please share the two parts code?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shahrukhqasim/TIES-2.0/issues/28/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shahrukhqasim/TIES-2.0/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
