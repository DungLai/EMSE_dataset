If you include a file that includes other files, those other files are assumed to be in the same folder as the initial main file.\r\n\r\nAssume the following file structure:\r\n/path1/main.chatette - includes /path2/shared.chatette\r\n/path2/shared.chatette - includes /path2/aliases.chatette\r\n/path2/aliases.chatette\r\n\r\nIf we try to generate examples using main.chatette, in this scenario, Chatette will look for the aliases.chatette file in /path1/ and not in /path2/, which is incorrect and throws an error.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMartin","closed_by":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
