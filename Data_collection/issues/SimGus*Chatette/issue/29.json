But it really looks more like all permutations.\r\n\r\nLet's say I have this configuration file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~[and-amp]\r\n   and\r\n   &\r\n\r\n~[name]\r\n   Clifford Woods\r\n   Lorenzo Malvasi\r\n   Ryan Wade\r\n```\r\n\r\nI run the interactive mode and I issue this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrule \"~[name] ~[and-amp] ~[name] went to town.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated text output is a careful permutation of all possibilities, in sequence.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGenerated examples:\r\nText: 'Clifford Woods & Clifford Woods went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Clifford Woods & Lorenzo Malavasi went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Clifford Woods & Ryan Wade went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Clifford Woods and Clifford Woods went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Clifford Woods and Lorenzo Malavasi went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Clifford Woods and Ryan Wade went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Lorenzo Malavasi & Clifford Woods went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Lorenzo Malavasi & Lorenzo Malavasi went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Lorenzo Malavasi & Ryan Wade went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Lorenzo Malavasi and Clifford Woods went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Lorenzo Malavasi and Lorenzo Malavasi went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Lorenzo Malavasi and Ryan Wade went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Ryan Wade & Clifford Woods went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Ryan Wade & Lorenzo Malavasi went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Ryan Wade & Ryan Wade went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Ryan Wade and Clifford Woods went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Ryan Wade and Lorenzo Malavasi went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\nText: 'Ryan Wade and Ryan Wade went to town.'\r\n        Entities: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, your animated gif on the homepage of the project show a number after the `rule` command for the number of generation, but I get an error if I put a number. And your output is different... Probably the Gif was made from an older version prior to 1.6.1.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was wondering if it is possible to get more random than permutation. For example, I would want just one pair of names and sometimes `and` and other times `&`. But not all name pairs with `and` and again all name pairs with `&`.","closed_by":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
