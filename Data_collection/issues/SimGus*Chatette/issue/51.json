What is your @[operating system]?\r\n    ~[greeting]  What is the name of your @[operating system]?  \r\n\r\ninstead of generating all possible variations for these intents, if I can control the number of variations from each sentence under every intent, something like ouput only 25% variations from each sentence by random sampling. \r\n\r\nThis would make my output files smaller and at the same time cover most of the variations. \r\n\r\nJust wanted to know if I can acheive something like this using the existing features.
