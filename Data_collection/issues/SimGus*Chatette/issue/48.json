I've been using chatette until recently.\r\n\r\nI want to know whether you have plan to support the new [Rasa's entities roles and groups](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/entity-extraction/#entities-roles-and-groups) since it's quite important to have with the recent Rasa.\r\nIf you don't plan to do it in short term, I might be able to look at it, but the parser section of the code is quite difficult to understand for me compared to the adapter part. \r\n\r\nI've also created a new yml adapter in preparation for Rasa 2.0 on my forked repo.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
