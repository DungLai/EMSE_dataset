For instance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    \"slot-name\": \"PER\",\r\n    \"value\": \"Albert Einstein\",\r\n    \"start-index\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, if I want to infer the span of slot (i.e., to pass it along to SpaCy's NER), I can find the end-index by summing the length of the value and the start index.\r\n\r\nWhile this is fine when no specific value is provided, when a value is provided for the slot, it becomes impossible to know for sure what is the span of the slot. For instance, if \"Albert Einstein\" is equal to some concept ID in a knowledge base:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    \"slot-name\": \"PER\",\r\n    \"value\": \"KB4245435\",\r\n    \"start-index\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt could be potentially doable to go through the generated synonyms, but this seems to be way harder than it needs to be. What I propose is the addition of a `end-index` field, as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    \"slot-name\": \"PER\",\r\n    \"value\": \"KB4245435\",\r\n    \"start-index\": 0,\r\n    \"end-index\":  15\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
