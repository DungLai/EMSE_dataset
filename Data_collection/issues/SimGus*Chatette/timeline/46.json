The same is true for roles and groups.\r\n\r\nAs adding support for those inline entity values shouldn't be too hard to implement, you can rest assured that this will be supported in the next update of Chatette.\r\n\r\nThat being said, entity values are supported if you use the JSON adapter (which will thus output JSON files that you can use with Rasa NLU).\r\n\r\nTo do that in the case of your example, you would use the following syntax in your template file:\r\n```\r\n@[code]\r\n  DataManagement = LA014\r\n```\r\nwhich will create an entity with name `code`, value `LA014` and text `DataManagement`.\r\n\r\nTo run Chatette using the JSON adapter, you'll need to use the command line argument `-a` or `--adapter`:\r\n```sh\r\npython3 -m chatette -a json <path/to/template-file>\r\n```\r\nNote that if you don't use this argument at all, Chatette will default to using the JSON adapter anyway.\r\n\r\nI hope that clears it out.\r\n\r\nCheers
