This can actually be expected in any process of creating a dataset for an AI-related task, even though you are right that rule-based generation of datasets makes overfitting more likely (at least in my experience).\r\nHowever, in most cases, it is possible to prevent overfitting by carefully crafting your templates.\r\n\r\nI thought about using machine learning models to improve generation as well. I could actually find a few projects which are intended to do that kind of thing: the [bitext](https://www.bitext.com/) project notably discusses this [here](https://blog.bitext.com/improving-rasas-results-with-linguistics-based-nlg), and I think code to \"expand\" the number of examples can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/bitext/rasa).\r\n\r\nI feel like using word2vec or BERT are theoretically good ideas, but are much more tricky in practice, since the user would be required to have a dataset representative of the kind of sentences the final product would encounter. That dataset needs to be broad enough to be useful, but not too broad to cover only the domain of interest and to avoid noise from getting in the final dataset. And even if such a dataset is available (which is generally not the case), the overfitting problem still remains, it was just moved to another dataset. For that reason, I am not convinced using such a model would really help addressing this problem. That being said, in some cases, I think it could be helpful.\r\n\r\nIf I were to design the kind of system you propose, I'd rather make it replace some placeholders in the generated sentences than embed it in Chatette itself. I'd rather keep the DSL as deterministic as possible, in order for the person who writes the templates to have as much control as possible. I would be very interested in seeing such a system implemented.\r\n\r\nAbout the problem of entities with high variability but which are very common (e.g. numbers, dates, weight, etc), I don't really see a clear solution. I thought of providing predefine templates for the most common cases, but I can't define those for any language and I want Chatette to be usable in any language (and I know that Chatette has been used in a quite large variety of languages such as French, Korean or Mandarin).\r\nAlso, some NLU engines such as Snips NLU tackle this problem already (you can tell it to expect a date at some point in a sentence for example).\r\nHowever, if you have any idea of solutions to that problem, feel free to post them here.\r\n\r\nThank you for your suggestions and questions, they made me reflect more on the theory behind this project :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/551280483/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2780964828,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3ODA5NjQ4Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2780964828","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-07T21:47:36Z","label":{"name":"feedback","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2780964830,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3ODA5NjQ4MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2780964830","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-07T21:47:36Z","label":{"name":"improvement","color":"4DD0E1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2780964831,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3ODA5NjQ4MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2780964831","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-07T21:47:36Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/551288234","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/25#issuecomment-551288234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/25","id":551

for the swift and comprehensive response. Firstly I had no idea bitext was looking at that exact problem and has some code for it, many thanks!\r\n\r\nRegarding the other points: I'm definitely not suggesting moving in any significant way away from the DSL framework to entirely autogenerated stuff as that would be dangerous. Rather I was thinking more along the lines of what you mention in terms of 'expansion' or in my mind a kind of slightly-more-advanced synonym substitution. \r\n\r\nTo your point about moving the overfitting from one set to another I agree this is a risk but I think given the relatively low level of interaction the code would have with the final sentence (meaning that it is not generating sentences without any other input, rather just modifying existing ones). For example, what I'm imagining is that, unless the language used is quite technical, a large BERT model might be a good way of performing limited word substitutions to existing sentences without breaking the context too much.  The assumption here is that BERT is general enough to be able to capture the majority of the 'base language stuff' and the existing DSL takes care of speciality areas. For example in the DSL you might tag certain parts of the sentence as open to BERT substitution and others fixed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the dataset needed: were the user to train word2vec from scratch I would agree this is risky because you may fail with generalisation but i'm hoping the hedging outlined above would mitigate that (won't know until we try i guess!). But i still think it's useful in the, i suspect common, case where a user might have a large corpus of data they know to be a good representation of the output space but  it's too hard/expensive to label it all. In that way this is kind of a proxy for semi-supervised learning (the supervision in this case being the DSL part).\r\n\r\nI agree it won't be a panacea for the problem of data generation for NLU, but i think that if you can add even a modest multiplier to the amount of labeled data you have from DSL, say 1.3x, that could be useful (and the system would no doubt have a variety of tolerance parameters to play with to make sure that extra 30% was as useful as possible)\r\n\r\nThanks again for the package and discussion! I very much appreciate your input will hopefully get some time shortly to experiment with this (famous last words...)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/551288234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Zylatis","id":1456631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTY2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1456631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylatis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylatis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/552231456","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/25#issuecomment-552231456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/25","id":552231456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjIzMTQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-10T20:38:04Z","updated_at":"2019-11-10T20:39:11Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nI think we are on the same page then: adding \"expansion\" capabilities to Chatette seems to be a good idea.
