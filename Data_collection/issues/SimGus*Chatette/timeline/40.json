Generally, you'll have to write either your templates on your own (or use someone else's), or write the training data yourself directly.\r\n\r\nThere would actually be a way to automatically turn a training data file into a template file, but without extracting the structure behind the examples, which wouldn't make much sense. For example, given the following `nlu.md`:\r\n```markdown\r\n## intent:ask-food\r\n- I want [food](food)\r\n- I want a little bit of [fish](food)\r\n- I would like [fish](food)\r\n- I would like some [food](food)\r\n```\r\nyou could automatically create this template file:\r\n```\r\n%[ask-food](4)\r\n  I want @[food]\r\n  I want a little bit of @[food]\r\n  I would like @[food]\r\n  I would like some @[food]\r\n\r\n@[food]\r\n  fish\r\n  food\r\n```\r\nwhich I assume is not what you want. Given the same training data, the following template would make much more sense, but is not easy to automatically generate -- if possible at all:\r\n```\r\n%[ask-food](4)\r\n  I want ~[some] @[food]\r\n  I would like ~[some] @[food]\r\n\r\n~[some]\r\n  some\r\n  a little bit of\r\n\r\n@[food]\r\n  food\r\n  fish\r\n```\r\nThis is obviously a very simple example, but I guess you see the point: making a template which contains each and every example that's in your training data doesn't make much sense.\r\nIf needed though, it shouldn't be too hard to make a small bash script that turns your `nlu.md` file into a \"dumb\" template file as I just showed you, if you really need this.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, this problem of extracting structure (i.e. templates) from a list of example is actually still an active research subject.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, could you please tell me why you need to do the reverse process that Chatette does?\r\n\r\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/611135181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3215440474,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIxNTQ0MDQ3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/3215440474","actor":{"login":"visvamba","id":13495457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDk1NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13495457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba","html_url":"https://github.com/visvamba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-08T19:02:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3215440478,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMTU0NDA0Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/3215440478","actor":{"login":"visvamba","id":13495457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDk1NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13495457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba","html_url":"https://github.com/visvamba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visvamba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-08T19:02:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3215441160,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyMTU0NDExNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/3215441160","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-08T19:02:35Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/611359909","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/40#issuecomment-611359909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/40","id":611359909,"node_id":"
