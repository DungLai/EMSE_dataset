Stripping the duplicates before writing the outputs seems to be the best solution, though it would be problematic in case we wanted a certain number of examples for a given intent. For example:\r\n```\r\n~[greet](3)\r\n   whatever\r\n```\r\nasks for three different examples. If it is possible to generate three different examples, they should be generated.\r\n\r\nI'll strip the duplicates as you said in case no number was given and I'll see what I'll do when a number is given. I don't have much time at the moment, so I'll do that ASAP.\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestion
