Once I have an answer, I'll implement it (I'll try to do this shortly).\r\n\r\nFor the moment, you will need to write your template files in a different way, to avoid the need of an alias argument.\r\nThere are actually a few (arguably ugly) workaround you can use:\r\n- Use the alias directly instead of an argument:\r\n```\r\n~[greetings]\r\n   Hi ~[NAME]\r\n   Hello ~[NAME]!\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\n~[greetings$NAME]\r\n   Hi $NAME\r\n   Hello $NAME!\r\n```\r\n- Break your alias into a beginning and end, and use the alias (or whatever template) in between:\r\n```\r\n~[greetings-start]\r\n   Hi\r\n   Hello\r\n~[greetings-end]\r\n   !\r\n   , how are you?\r\n~[greetings]\r\n   ~[greetings-start] ~[NAME] ~[greetings-end]\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\n~[greetings$~[NAME]]\r\n   Hi ~[NAME]!\r\n   Hi ~[NAME], how are you?\r\n   Hello ~[NAME]!\r\n   Hello ~[NAME], how are you?\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that none of those workarounds is fully satisfying, which is why I'm still willing to implement such a feature.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/616754535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3253198351,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyNTMxOTgzNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/3253198351","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T19:15:17Z","label":{"name":"improvement","color":"4DD0E1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3253198355,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyNTMxOTgzNTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/3253198355","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T19:15:17Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/616928285","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/44#issuecomment-616928285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/44","id":616928285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjkyODI4NQ==","user":{"login":"TatianaParshina","id":42603622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjAzNjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42603622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina","html_url":"https://github.com/TatianaParshina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TatianaParshina/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T03:20:50Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T03:20:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @SimGus , thank you a lot for your quick reply!\r\n\r\n1. Actually in my task I need to use nested alias. I mean structure like this: \r\n```\r\n~[NAME]\r\n  ~[FIRST_NAME] ~[SURNAME]\r\n\r\n~[FIRST_NAME]\r\n  John\r\n  Bill\r\n\r\n~[SURNAME]\r\n  Smith  \r\n  Brown\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. I think it will be also useful to add functionality to support entity as argument as well :\r\n\r\n```\r\n@[NAME]\r\n  John\r\n  Elvis\r\n\r\n@[FIRST_NAME]\r\n  John\r\n  Bill\r\n\r\n@[SURNAME]\r\n  Smith  \r\n  Brown\r\n\r\n~[greetings$NAME]\r\n   Hi $NAME\r\n   Hello $NAME!\r\n```\r\nSo for different intents it can be used as:\r\n```\r\n%[intent_name]\r\n    ~[greetings$@[NAME]]\r\n\r\n%[intent_first_name]\r\n    ~[greetings$@[FIRST_NAME]]\r\n\r\n%[intent_surname]\r\n
