Your example would thus become:\r\n```\r\nbusca**[me]** un buen restaurante\r\n```\r\nThis will generate this example: `busca**me** un buen restaurante` (and only this one).\r\n\r\nThis is explained in the [syntax specifications](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/blob/master/syntax-specs.md) (and I am making a wiki to improve the documentation). You can also look into the examples on this repo (notably the one in `examples/simple/restaurant` which looks similar to what you seem to be doing).\r\n\r\nRegards","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/453768838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2070200851,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA3MDIwMDg1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2070200851","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-12T18:08:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2070214070,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIwNzAyMTQwNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2070214070","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-12T18:37:25Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
