To me, using the templates you showed, the slot `@[paymentPeriod]` should generate something like this: `[[hour](paymentPeriod:hour)](paymentPeriod)`. As you may know, this is not supported by Rasa.\r\nTo avoid having this kind of problems, I will add an error if Chatette detects nested slots in your templates.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing your template, I think I understand what you want to be generated: you would like a slot called `paymentPeriod` that could contain either `hour`, `h`, `day` or `d`, is that right?\r\nIf so, the following template will achieve this:\r\n```\r\n~[paymentPeriod:hour]\r\n\thour\r\n\th\r\n~[paymentPeriod:day]\r\n\tday\r\n\td\r\n\r\n@[paymentPeriod]\r\n        ~[paymentPeriod:hour]\r\n        ~[paymentPeriod:day]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you want a slot called `paymentPeriod:hour` that could have the values `hour` or `h` and another one called `paymentPeriod:day` that could have the values `day` or `d`, then I'm afraid you will have to make 2 different slots and use them wherever you want, as in the following template:\r\n```\r\n@[paymentPeriod:hour]\r\n\thour\r\n\th\r\n@[paymentPeriod:day]\r\n\tday\r\n\td\r\n\r\n~[some alias]\r\n        ... [@[paymentPeriod:hour]|@[paymentPeriod:day]] ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf what you're looking for is some kind of \"categories of slots\" (e.g. `hour` and `day` being 2 slots that are part of a `paymentPeriod` category), I am afraid Rasa doesn't support this kind of things. Therefore, Chatette doesn't support it neither. That being said, I might add something like this in the far future, but I'll need to find a solution to \"translate\" them to something Rasa would understand.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/559610230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2839954467,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4Mzk5NTQ0Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2839954467","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-28T22:04:29Z","label":{"name":"feedback","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2839954468,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4Mzk5NTQ0Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2839954468","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-28T22:04:29Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/559748338","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/30#issuecomment-559748338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/30","id":559748338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTc0ODMzOA==","user":{"login":"alifanov","id":2394285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTQyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2394285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov","html_url":"https://github.com/alifanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T10:47:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T10:47:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Right

 see. Then, I suppose your solution is a good one. To make it easier to reuse your slots, I would suggest using a template such as this:\r\n```\r\n... your slot definitions ...\r\n~[paymentPeriod]\r\n   @[paymentPeriod:day]\r\n   @[paymentPeriod:hour]\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then use this alias as if it was a slot, rather than needing to write the same list of slots over and over again ;)\r\n\r\nFor the record, it is also sometimes useful to use variations of slots (but I’m guessing this will not be a solution in your case), like this:\r\n```\r\n@[paymentPeriod#hour]\r\n   hour\r\n   h\r\n@[paymentPeriod#day]\r\n   day\r\n   d\r\n```\r\nYou can then use the slot `@[paymentPeriod]` as if it was defined, and the generator will choose one of the variations at random. However, in that case, the name of the generated entity will be `paymentPeriod` and not the name of the chosen variation.\r\n\r\nI understand that in your case, none of the solutions I suggested is totally satisfying. I’ll see if I can make some changes that would help in your situation, because I guess such cases must come up often.\r\n\r\nThanks for your questions :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/559931703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/563137686","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/30#issuecomment-563137686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/30","id":563137686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzEzNzY4Ng==","user":{"login":"alifanov","id":2394285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTQyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2394285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov","html_url":"https://github.com/alifanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T09:15:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T09:15:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/563137686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alifanov","id":2394285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTQyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2394285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov","html_url":"https://github.com/alifanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2865489726,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg2NTQ4OTcyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/2865489726","actor":{"login":"alifanov","id":2394285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTQyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2394285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov","html_url":"https://github.com/alifanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alifanov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T09:15:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
