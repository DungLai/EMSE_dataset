I'll fix it as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nNow for your question, I am not entirely sure I understand what you're asking.\r\nI guess your question is about the interactive mode, right? When you say you want \"more random than permutations\", do you mean you would like to have the same kind of output as you show in your question, but with fewer sentences (i.e. not all possible permutations), or am I misunderstanding here?\r\n\r\nIf so, that is exactly what the \"number\" parameter of the `rule` command is meant for: you ask the program to generate this number of sentences given a rule. Basically, `rule \"[a|b|c]\" 2` would generate 2 of the 3 possible sentences (`a`, `b` and `c`), while `rule \"[a|b|c]\"` would generate all of them.\r\nAs you pointed out though, this feature is currently broken.\r\n\r\nIf what you meant was that you want to allow duplicates in the generated output, that is not currently implemented as I don't see a use case for that at the moment. If that is the case, could you please tell me more about what you are trying to do, so that I can see if such a feature is worth adding to the program? :)\r\n\r\nAll that being said, if what you care about is getting the output and you don't really need to have an interactive experience, you can just add your rule as part of an intent in your template file, give this intent a maximum number of examples to generate and run Chatette on it in normal more. In the case you show, you would add this line to your template file:\r\n```\r\n%[intent](5)\r\n   ~[name] ~[and-amp] ~[name] went to town.\r\n```\r\nOf course, you can replace the `5` by any number you like and you will get that number of examples generated (without duplicates).\r\nYou can use the `jsonl` or `rasamd` adapters to get output files which are easy to reuse in other projects (other than as an input to *Rasa NLU*).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions if you need to!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/557832495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/557833709","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/29#issuecomment-557833709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/29","id":557833709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzgzMzcwOQ==","user":{"login":"etlweather","id":3467506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Njc1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3467506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather","html_url":"https://github.com/etlweather","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etlweather/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T21:19:21Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T21:19:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
