What is your @[operating system]?\r\n   ~[greeting] What is the name of your @[operating system]?\r\n```\r\nNote the `(12)` right after the intent declaration. As you can expect, this will generate 12 different examples for this intent (or fewer if all combination represent fewer than 12 examples).\r\n\r\nAbout asking for a percentage of all possibilities for an intent on the other hand, this feature is not implemented, but I have plans to add it.\r\n\r\nI hope this clears it up for you!\r\nI'll close the issue but feel free to ask for more details here if needed. You can also find more information in the wiki.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/772888141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4287981501,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI4Nzk4MTUwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/4287981501","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-03T23:05:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4287982525,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQyODc5ODI1MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/4287982525","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-03T23:06:16Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/787917756","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/51#issuecomment-787917756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/51","id":787917756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NzkxNzc1Ng==","user":{"login":"dingusagar","id":12700858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAwODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12700858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar","html_url":"https://github.com/dingusagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingusagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-01T12:38:13Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T12:38:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"totally missed this feature when I was reading the wiki pages. this is super helpful!
