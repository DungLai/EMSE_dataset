Plus, this workaround would be very ugly for a choice with more than 2 categories (you'd need to embed a choice into another I presume).\r\n\r\nI'll write that down as a nice feature to add in an upcoming version, but at the moment this remains unsupported.\r\nI'll notify you when this feature is implemented and close this issue.\r\n\r\nCheers!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/comments/638414666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3403729481,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0MDM3Mjk0ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/3403729481","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-03T19:31:46Z","label":{"name":"feature","color":"9CCC65"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3403729485,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0MDM3Mjk0ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SimGus/Chatette/issues/events/3403729485","actor":{"login":"SimGus","id":20604236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20604236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus","html_url":"https://github.com/SimGus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimGus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-03T19:31:46Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"AB47BC"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
