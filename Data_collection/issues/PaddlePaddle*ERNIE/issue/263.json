Empirically, the words that appear in many parts of a document are usually\r\ncommonly-used words or relevant with the main topics of the document. Therefore, through identifying the key words of a document appearing in the segment, the task can enable the ability of a model to capture the key words of the document to some extent\r\n\r\n我有2个问题。\r\n\r\n问题1，是如何在input data中标示要预测的token的？\r\n问题2，一个token在文章中出现很多次的话，这个token可能是很常见的token，也有可能是对于这个文章来说很重要的token。直接预测token是否多次出现，应该不能得到一个判断capture the key words的模型。是否有用TFIDF之类的方法做了进一步的处理？\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tanaka-jp","id":29939758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTM5NzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29939758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp","html_url":"https://github.com/tanaka-jp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanaka-jp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE/issues/263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE/issues/263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
