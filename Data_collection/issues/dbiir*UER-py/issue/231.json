And I have one question about it.\r\nI usually use the Huggingface/Transformers' API to train or fine-tune the models and I find that you also upload your model to Huggingface website. But when I used their code (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/pytorch/translation/run_translation.py) to fine-tune your T5 model, it failed to generate any text. Do I miss any difference between you and them? Could I use the same code to fine-tune all the models?\r\nLooking forward to your reply.\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Arvid-pku","id":53811705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODExNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53811705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku","html_url":"https://github.com/Arvid-pku","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arvid-pku/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dbiir/UER-py/issues/231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dbiir/UER-py/issues/231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
