MLM loss also increases remarkably, from 0.7 to 1.0. I think it is safe to say that both MLM and NSP suffer from a degradation. The only reason I come up with is that an error in a small fraction of the corpus occurs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dbiir/UER-py/issues/comments/1353039794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dr-GitHub-account","id":59919093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTE5MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59919093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account","html_url":"https://github.com/dr-GitHub-account","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr-GitHub-account/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
