Refactoring & interface unification. \r\n***Doesn't touch metrics computations***.\r\n\r\nList of changes:\r\n* Added interface for model trainers `moses/interfaces.py`. ***Each <Model>Trainer is responsible for vocabulary construction, dataloader creation, fitting and validation of model, logging a progress and checkpoint creation.*** <Model>Trainer requires only config and is independent of any model instantiation and any dataset (those have to be provided in trainer methods' arguments). <Model>Trainers have similar structure for all existing models. \r\n\r\n* All `moses/<model>/datautils.py` were removed with functionality migrated to corresponding <Model>Trainer-s.\r\n\r\n* All `scripts/<model>/{train.py or sample.py}` scripts are removed. Now, one should use `scripts/{train.py or sample.py} <model>`with the same arguments.\r\n\r\n* All `moses/<model>/model.py` were refactored, some auxiliary functionality was added.\r\n\r\n* Added support for `--n_workers` argument which specifies a size of Dataloader's workers pool. \r\n\r\n* Models' config arguments' names were revised and unified.\r\n\r\n* Added `ModelsStorage` class which allows to operate with all supported models without additional efforts. Now, to add a new model to MOSES pipeline, one have to add only 2 lines to ModelsStorage code.\r\n\r\n* `scripts/run.py` was refactored.\r\n\r\n* Other tiny fixes and changes (expressions simplification, removing unused imports etc.).\r\n\r\nFor additional details please take a look in the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2119382569,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjExOTM4MjU2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/2119382569","actor":{"login":"zhebrak","id":293699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak","html_url":"https://github.com/zhebrak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-05T19:05:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
