@Dom303,\r\n\r\nThe reason why we are using specifically tensorflow-gpu 1.14 is because it is the last version that supports the loading of the pretrained models and weights for the heteroencoder in the LatentGAN.   I do not recall if the newer branch of the heteroencoder, intended for tensorflow 2.0 use, is compatible with the LatentGAN and allowing us to train new models, but the immediate problem is that it would render reproducibility impossible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/comments/620328672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SeemonJ","id":52204459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjA0NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52204459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ","html_url":"https://github.com/SeemonJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeemonJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3278238550,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI3ODIzODU1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/3278238550","actor":{"login":"Dom303","id":12683840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgzODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12683840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303","html_url":"https://github.com/Dom303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-28T01:49:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3278238552,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNzgyMzg1NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/3278238552","actor":{"login":"Dom303","id":12683840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgzODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12683840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303","html_url":"https://github.com/Dom303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-28T01:49:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/comments/620608565","html_url":"https://github.com/molecularsets/moses/issues/81#issuecomment-620608565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/81","id":620608565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDYwODU2NQ==","user":{"login":"Dom303","id":12683840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgzODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12683840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303","html_url":"https://github.com/Dom303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom303/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T13:29:15Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T13:29:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry,

I would, however, advise you to try to start with a fresh heteroencoder model rather than the moses-pretrained model, if you have a training set that has different structures than the moses molecules.
