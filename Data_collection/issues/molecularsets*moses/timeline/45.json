It is expected behavior since we don't need the latent codes for the generation. One can think of VAE here as a CharRNN with an auxiliary reconstruction regularizer as opposed to a standard view (reconstruction with auxiliary KL regulariazer)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/comments/494884005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danpol","id":1181277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODEyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1181277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol","html_url":"https://github.com/danpol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2359979154,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM1OTk3OTE1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/2359979154","actor":{"login":"maxime-langevin","id":26231992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjMxOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26231992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin","html_url":"https://github.com/maxime-langevin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-22T16:49:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2359979163,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNTk5NzkxNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/2359979163","actor":{"login":"maxime-langevin","id":26231992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjMxOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26231992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin","html_url":"https://github.com/maxime-langevin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-22T16:49:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3022347179,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzAyMjM0NzE3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/3022347179","actor":{"login":"danpol","id":1181277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODEyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1181277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol","html_url":"https://github.com/danpol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-10T11:33:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
