Then you should save your vocab with `torch.save(vocab, your_vocab_path)`. To train/evaluate the model with your vocabulary, pass `--vocab_save your_vocab_path` to the script.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a custom vocabulary (e.g., a custom tokenizer), you can create a class with the same interface as CharVocab and save to a file with `torch.save`. You can then train/evaluate the model similar to the previous case (`--vocab_save your_vocab_path`): this will automatically load an instance of your class and use it during training and evaluation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/comments/496442124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danpol","id":1181277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODEyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1181277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol","html_url":"https://github.com/danpol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2371189680,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM3MTE4OTY4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/2371189680","actor":{"login":"meghanakanapaneni","id":30812554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODEyNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30812554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni","html_url":"https://github.com/meghanakanapaneni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-28T09:36:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2371189681,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNzExODk2ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/2371189681","actor":{"login":"meghanakanapaneni","id":30812554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODEyNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30812554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni","html_url":"https://github.com/meghanakanapaneni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meghanakanapaneni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-28T09:36:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3022328835,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzAyMjMyODgzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/events/3022328835","actor":{"login":"danpol","id":1181277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODEyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1181277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol","html_url":"https://github.com/danpol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danpol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-10T11:27:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues
