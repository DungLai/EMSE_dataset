students, we are interested in characterizing the performance tradeoffs in teacher forcing. While models subsequent to `chemical_vae` have effectively dealt with the syntactic invalidity of generated molecules, we plan to look at SMILES strings as a case-study of teacher forcing to attempt to learn a context-free grammar without explicit constraint. We are planning to develop this enhancement but appreciate any input or review.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n#1026 implemented the `chemical_vae` character-based VAE from [aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae) without teacher forcing. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/deepchem/deepchem/issues/2456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/deepchem/deepchem/issues/2456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
