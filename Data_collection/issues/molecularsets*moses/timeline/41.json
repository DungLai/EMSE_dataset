I understood you correctly, you want to manually call encode/decode functions for a trained model? For example, in AAE you can run `model.encoder(x)` and `model.decoder(x)` respectively. Here, `x` is one-hot encoding of a SMILES string. You can get it using [collate function](https://github.com/molecularsets/moses/blob/master/moses/aae/trainer.py#L235): `collate = aae_trainer.get_collate_fn(aae)`.  Then you can get `x` using `collate(list_of_smiles)`.
