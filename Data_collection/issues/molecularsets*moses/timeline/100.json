It's uncessary though- the purpose of the class is really to initialize the embedding layer (`nn.Embedding`) with the identity matrix (L18). Two notes:\r\n1. the weights of the embedding layer can be learned and there's nothing special about the identity matrix\r\n2. the embedding size does not need to be the same as the vocab size. many VAE implementations project the vocabulary into a higher-dimensional embedding space (i.e., `d_emb` > `n_vocab`) with this typically improving performance","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/comments/1254243987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidegraff","id":60193893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTkzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60193893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff","html_url":"https://github.com/davidegraff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidegraff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
