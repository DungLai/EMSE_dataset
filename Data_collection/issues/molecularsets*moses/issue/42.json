The reason being that a vanilla VAE seems to be unable to learn from a SMILES dataset otherwise. \r\n\r\nIn Moses VAE's training scheme it seems to me that the KL penalty has a weighting factor that starts at 0 and grows linearly towards 1 with the number of epochs increasing. \r\n\r\nDo you find that this annealing of the KL term allows to get the best of both worlds, i.e not train just a plain AE while still being able to acheive low reconstruction error and high log-likelihood?\r\nAny insights on the impact of this scheme and of the KL penalty in general on the training of a VAE on a SMILES dataset?\r\n\r\nThanks for your amazing repo!","closed_by":{"login":"maxime-langevin","id":26231992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjMxOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26231992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin","html_url":"https://github.com/maxime-langevin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxime-langevin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/42/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
