I'm the beginner in this field, so maybe these are some silly questions. But hopefully, you guys can help to give me some suggestions. Thanks!\r\n\r\nFirstly, whether the variable **'vocab'** was generated by **CharVocab.from_data** function as mentioned in **README.md**. Additionally, if so, I couldn't find a property called '**vectors**'.\r\nWhat the exactly type of the variable **'vocab'**  there? Whether I missed other key points on '**vocab**'?
