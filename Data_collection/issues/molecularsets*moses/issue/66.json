Instructions starting \"Benchmarking your models\" and below are actually not clear to me. Exactly what needs to be done step by step to run each of the 5 models? I would appreciate knowing the steps. For example, what exactly are the path <reference dataset> --gen_path <generated dataset> for the aae, charRNN, organ, latentgan and vae models under Training, Generation and Evaluation?. \r\nWhat special needs to be done for latentgan, e.g. re. ddc_pub v3, molvengen, ...?\r\nHow exactly to execute sh scripts/run_all_models.sh?\r\nI am using Python 3.7.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.2, and have installed rdkit 2019.03.4.0, and molsets 0.2 and many other packages? Is there an exact requirements list of packages required to run MOSES?  \r\nWill appreciate your clarifications.
