Like, input a article and predict the abstract. When I finish training, I get almost same output with different input. Code are same as your example, data should be right, because with same data, and use lstm block as seq2seq, I got the proper output.\r\nHope for your answer, Thanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lsdefine/attention-is-all-you-need-keras/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lsdefine/attention-is-all-you-need-keras/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
