When copying or operating with the constant, the user might not realize that a new tensor is created and the `active_doms` attribute is lost.\r\n\r\nI propose to separate the logic of LTN with the logic of Tensorflow, and use distinct types. Something like:\r\n```\r\nclass Constant:\r\n    def __init__(self, value):\r\n        self.tensor = tf.constant(value)\r\n        self.active_doms = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implies that LTN predicates and functions will have to be adapted to work with `constant.tensor`, `variable.tensor`, ...","closed_by":{"login":"sbadredd","id":43364643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzY0NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43364643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd","html_url":"https://github.com/sbadredd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
