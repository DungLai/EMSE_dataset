I believe this is worth it, for the sake of clarity.\r\nIn case the user wouldn't want to do that, he can still re-use the lambda function inside of a `Mask` predicate:\r\n```\r\nMask = ltn.Predicate.Lambda(lambda vars: tf.equal(vars[0]+vars[1],vars[2]))\r\n...\r\nexists(...,...,\r\n    mask=Mask([d1,d2,labels_z])\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThe mask is still written using an LTN symbol and doesn't require changing the code much compared to the original approach","closed_by":{"login":"sbadredd","id":43364643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzY0NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43364643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd","html_url":"https://github.com/sbadredd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
