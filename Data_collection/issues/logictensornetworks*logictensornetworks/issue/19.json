further than issue #16, we can define classes for `Term` and `Formula`.\r\n- `Variable` and `Constant` would be subclasses of `Term`\r\n- The output of a `Function` is a `Term`\r\n- `Proposition` is a subclass of `Formula`\r\n- The output of a `Predicate` is a `Formula`, and so is the result of connective and quantifiers operations\r\n\r\nThis can in turn be used for type checking the arguments of various functions:\r\n- The inputs of predicates and functions must be instances of `Term`\r\n- The inputs of connective and quantifier operations must be instances of `Formula`\r\n\r\nThis could be
