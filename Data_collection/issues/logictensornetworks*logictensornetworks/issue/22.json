#19 defined classes for `Term` and `Formula` following the usual definitions of FOL ([see also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic#Formation_rules))\r\n\r\nThis can be used to type-check the arguments of various functions:\r\n- The inputs of predicates and functions are instances of `Term`,\r\n- The expressions in connectives and quantifier operations are instances of `Formula`,\r\n- The masks in quantifiers are instances of `Formula`.\r\n\r\nThis is already indicated in type hints.\r\nAdding a runtime validation would make a stronger API and ensure that the user correctly uses
