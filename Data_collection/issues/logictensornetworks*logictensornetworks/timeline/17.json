issue #17 and #20 , the commit 578d7bcaa35c797ac1c94cf322f0a6ec524beaa2 updated the axioms in the clustering example.\r\n\r\nIt introduced a typo in the masks.\r\nIn pseudo-code the rules with masks should be: \r\n```\r\nfor all x,y s.t. close_threshold > distance(x,y): x,y belong to the same cluster\r\nfor all x,y s.t. distance(x,y) > distant_threshold: x,y belong to different cluster\r\n```\r\nHowever, the rules have been written:\r\n```\r\nfor all x,y s.t.  distance(x,y) > close_threshold: x,y belong to the same cluster\r\nfor all x,y s.t. distant_threshold > distance(x,y) : x,y belong to different cluster\r\n```\r\nBasically, the operands have been mixed. This explains why the [latest results](https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/blob/578d7bcaa35c797ac1c94cf322f0a6ec524beaa2/examples/clustering/clustering.ipynb) were not as good as the [previous ones](https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/blob/6a01cc8429b72772cca59d2127c3b95b73dbbd5d/examples/clustering/clustering.ipynb).\r\nThis is easy to fix; the operands just have to be interchanged again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
