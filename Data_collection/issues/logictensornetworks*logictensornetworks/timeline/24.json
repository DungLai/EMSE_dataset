If you write:\r\n```\r\nmask = (labels_position==\"P\")\r\ntensor_P = features[mask]\r\nx_P = ltn.variable(\"P\", tensor_P)\r\n```\r\n- Does the error occur on the second line?\r\n- If yes, can you check the value and type of `mask`, is it a `tf.Tensor`/`np.ndarray`, or a scalar value? It seems that in your case, `mask` could be just a boolean, which would cause the Tensorflow error `mask cannot be scalar` \r\n- If `mask` is not a `tf.Tensor`, you need to convert `labels_position` to a tensor beforehand. Also, try writing `mask = tf.equal(labels_position,\"P\")` to be more explicit\r\n\r\nHope it helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/comments/961583823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbadredd","id":43364643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzY0NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43364643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd","html_url":"https://github.com/sbadredd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbadredd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/comments/962619456","html_url":"https://github.com/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/24#issuecomment-962619456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/issues/24","id":962619456,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFoAF845YGhA","user":{"login":"MilenaTenorio","id":26445250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ1MjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26445250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio","html_url":"https://github.com/MilenaTenorio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilenaTenorio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-07T14:21:30Z","updated_at":"2021-11-07T14:21:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nThank
