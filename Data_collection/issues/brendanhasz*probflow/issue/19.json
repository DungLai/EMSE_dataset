For `'all'`, get a prod(shape)-length vector via the QR decomposition, then reshape into the correct shape.  For `'column'` and `'row'`, only allow 2d shape, and can matrix multiply the A from the QR decomp by a matrix, then transpose for row. Can do that in the `transform` function, and have appropriate priors such that resulting parameters have `prior ~ normal(0, 1)`.  And make sure to mention that the prior is fixed in the docs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add `CenteredParameter`\r\n- [ ] tests\r\n- [ ] docs\r\n- [ ] add section to parameters page of user guide","closed_by":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
