See [this issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/18125) and [this pull request](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/22742).  So, could just wait till that's implemented and then use it to implement `pf.distributions.Mixture` w/ PyTorch backend.\r\n\r\nOr, in the meantime could add a manual implementation [like this](https://gist.github.com/SkafteNicki/4d582f0952941a98f920af6cb5f680a2) to `pf.utils.torch_distributions.  (Basically the same thing as `get_TorchDeterministic`, but returns the mixture distribution class)\r\n\r\nUpdate: looks like they've got a MixtureSameFamily implementation now!  \r\n So use that.  https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html#mixturesamefamily","closed_by":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
