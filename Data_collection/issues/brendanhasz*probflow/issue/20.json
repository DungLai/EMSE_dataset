Just `update`?) method to `pf.models.Model` which sets the prior distributions to the current value of the posterior distributions, to allow Bayesian updating / streaming inference / incremental updates.  \r\n\r\nShould be relatively straightforward I think. :thinking: Can't just do ``for p in self.parameters: p.prior = p.posterior`` since that would set it by reference, but will need to make a copy of each parameter's posterior Distribution object and fix the underlying variables at their current values (get constants from variables), then set the prior to that.  Maybe add a `bayesian_udpate()` method to Parameter which does that, then Module's `bayesian_update()` can just be `for p in self.parameters: p.bayesian_update()`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
