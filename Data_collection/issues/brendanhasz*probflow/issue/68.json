I encountered an issue where the backend defaulted to tensorflow even though I installed the pytorch version. I edited the settings file and changed the default 'tensorflow' param value in the __init__ method to 'pytorch' and its been working fine. \r\n\r\nHope to see this repository continue to be worked on! I think it really could be awesome for non-native ML guys like myself.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
