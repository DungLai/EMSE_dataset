This is pure generative model:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: __call__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given\r\n```\r\n\r\n`model.prob` calls the above implemenation of `__call__` which doesn't accept any `x`.\r\n\r\nIt can be easily fixed by passing the values as `y`:\r\n```\r\nprobs = model.prob(x=None, y=Pp.astype('float32'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether it's documentation or implementation error. It would seem more natural to just provide the X-value if the Y is not present in the model.","closed_by":{"login":"pkubik","id":4431772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzE3NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4431772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik","html_url":"https://github.com/pkubik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
