Thanks for trying out the package!  Yep, yeah the default backend is tensorflow, even if you install the pytorch version.  To get it to use the pytorch backend, you have to do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport probflow as pf\r\n\r\npf.set_backend('pytorch')\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore initializing any modules/models.\r\n\r\nSee here for more info: https://probflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/backend.html#setting-the-backend\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if or how it would be possible to get it to set the default backend depending on the install options.  Maybe some combo of package data and a post-install script?  Not sure - I've not messed around with python packaging beyond the basics.  But if you know of a good way, I'm open to it cuz that would be a sweet feature!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBrendan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/909519654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
