And thanks for pointing out the problem!  I think maybe it's a problem with the example not being clear enough - the `dims` arguments to the generator and discriminator constructors need to reflect your data's dimensionality. The last element of the list passed to `Generator`, and the first element of the list passed to `Discriminator`, should be the number of features in your dataset.\r\n\r\nSo, instead of\r\n\r\n```python\r\nG = Generator([3, 256, 128, 7])\r\nD = Discriminator([7, 256, 128, 1])\r\n```\r\n\r\ntry\r\n\r\n```python\r\nNf = 100 #number of features\r\nG = Generator([3, 256, 128, Nf])\r\nD = Discriminator([Nf, 256, 128, 1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if that actually fixes your problem.  And I'll make it more clear in the example.  Thanks again for pointing it out!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBrendan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/539080425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/539447397","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/3#issuecomment-539447397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/3","id":539447397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTQ0NzM5Nw==","user":{"login":"arainboldt","id":54881218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODgxMjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54881218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt","html_url":"https://github.com/arainboldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arainboldt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-08T10:12:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T10:12:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Brendan,\r\n\r\nthanks for the quick response and explanation.
