Which matplotlib version are you using?  If you're using a newer one, it seems like something's broke with the latest release of matplotlib (I actually wasn't able to even import the package past 3.3.4 ðŸ˜• , was getting [this error](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/issues/1691)).  Try using any matplotlib version <=`3.3.4`, that seemed to work for me (see [this google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ALNcZ5H7XO6IDKP_97rNBpKq9Q5GdS4u?usp=sharing) for a working example and the versions used).  Specifically I tested `3.2.2`, `3.3.0`, and `3.3.4` and they all worked; while `3.4.0` and `3.4.2` did not.\r\n\r\nThat said, you've made me realize there was a separate unrelated bug in that example!  Fixed it here https://github.com/brendanhasz/probflow/pull/65 Apparently torch doesn't like casting a torch tensor to a torch tensor (I think maybe it was cutting off the gradient propagation? But not sure tbh.  But anyway the [updated example](https://probflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/fully_connected.html) works).  So basically just make sure you have the `x = torch.tensor(x)` line only in your top-level module (which in that example is the `DenseRegression` class).\r\n\r\nThanks for letting me know about the error and hope that helps! ðŸ˜„ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/864742221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
