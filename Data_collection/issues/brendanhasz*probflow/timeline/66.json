Thanks for posting the issue!  I'm assuming you're using the Tensorflow backend? \r\n Sounds like this might be a problem with Tensorflow Probability not playing nice with newer Python versions (see https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/issues/1226).\r\n\r\nWhich Python version are you running, and which versions of `tensorflow` and `tesnsorflow-probability`?  Running the \"Simple Linear Regression\" example (I assume you mean [this one](https://probflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/linear_regression.html#simple-linear-regression)?) works with Python 3.7 and\r\n\r\n```\r\ntensorflow-probability==0.12.1 or 0.13.0\r\ntensorflow==2.5.0\r\nprobflow==2.4.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18IAhw98QmShUkLTRsD0j_9i1Xeq6W1bj?usp=sharing) for a working version.\r\n\r\nSo unfortunately you may have to downgrade your Python (to 3.8 or 3.7), and/or change tensorflow-probability versions (both 0.12.1 and 0.13.0 worked for me with Python 3.7).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/869215362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/869216798","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/66#issuecomment-869216798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/66","id":869216798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTIxNjc5OA==","user":{"login":"caprone","id":15055331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15055331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone","html_url":"https://github.com/caprone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-27T20:02:20Z","updated_at":"2021-06-27T20:02:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"HI
