Looks like there was a bug with the older version on PyPi (so, the docs are correct and it's an implementation error which had been fixed since, but I hadn't updated the packaged version).  Released the newest version on PyPi, which should work with that example. You should be able to install the updated version with either\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install --upgrade probflow\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, directly from the source on github:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install git+https://github.com/brendanhasz/probflow.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks again and let me know if that solves the problem.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBrendan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/543336596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/comments/543997565","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/4#issuecomment-543997565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/4","id":543997565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mzk5NzU2NQ==","user":{"login":"pkubik","id":4431772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzE3NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4431772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik","html_url":"https://github.com/pkubik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkubik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T23:09:13Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T23:09:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, it works now.
