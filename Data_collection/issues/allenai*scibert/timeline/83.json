Goal\r\nMake this repository installable\r\n```\r\npip install git+https://github.com/allenai/scibert.git\r\n```\r\nCloses #83 \r\n\r\n### Important notes\r\n- The `@` syntax requires `pip>=19.1`\r\n- Fixed the version to `0.1` ([semantic versioning](https://semver.org/))\r\n- The `scripts`  and `data` folders are not included during installation. This means one could only use it for inference. To address this problem in the future I would suggest creating [entry_points](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#automatic-script-creation) for the `scripts`. One could use [data_files](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files)  for the `data` folder.\r\n- I wanted to use the official `allennlp` branch since https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3537 introduced the gradient accumulation feature. However, the merged commit is only available in the new major releases (`1.x.x`) and it breaks the `scibert` code. Therefore I gave up and use the fork https://github.com/ibeltagy/allennlp@fp16_and_others instead (as done currently in `requirements.txt`)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/86/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/86/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3340603600,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM0MDYwMzYwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/3340603600","actor":{"login":"ibeltagy","id":2287797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODc3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2287797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy","html_url":"https://github.com/ibeltagy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-15T11:58:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
