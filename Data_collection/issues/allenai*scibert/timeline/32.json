Thanks for reply. Does that mean that your pretrained Sci-Bert model reaches masked_lm_accuracy of around 0.718? However, in the BERT original model, they reaches around 0.98 masked_lm_accuracy and about 1.0 next_sentence accuracy. May I ask do you think a masked_lm_accuracy of around 0.718 is enough? \r\nI am training also my own model on a customized dataset, which adds around 1000 new tokens that are not in BERT model. Currently my model also reaches about over 0.7 masked_lm_accuracy and improves very slowly since then. Thus I would like to know what is the masked_lm_accuracy or next_sentence_accuracy that I should expect for my pre-trained model to achieve. Are there any tricks for fine-tuning the pretrained model on customized corpus?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/comments/491638727/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sibyl1956","id":15240619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwNjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15240619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956","html_url":"https://github.com/sibyl1956","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2335507910,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMzNTUwNzkxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/2335507910","actor":{"login":"ibeltagy","id":2287797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODc3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2287797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy","html_url":"https://github.com/ibeltagy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-12T23:38:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2335507911,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMzU1MDc5MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/2335507911","actor":{"login":"ibeltagy","id":2287797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODc3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2287797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy","html_url":"https://github.com/ibeltagy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibeltagy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-12T23:38:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/comments/506868134","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scibert/issues/32#issuecomment-506868134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/32","id":506868134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjg2ODEzNA==","user":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-28T20:32:45Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T20:32:45Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@sibyl1956  This is a good point and I suspect this is due to the noisy PDF parse in the scientific corpus.  Namely, we didn't do anything to remove tables, equations, weird tokens, etc. that was output by PDFBox in converting the raw PDF to a text stream.  You can expect it's essentially impossible for the model to really predict these masked tokens.  We're currently in the process of curating an updated larger & cleaner version of the pretraining corpus, and will investigate whether the noisy tokens are the cause for this.  As it is now, the current released SciBERT weights are still very good for downstream tasks (but we can definitely do better).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/comments/506868134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2448353332,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ0ODM1MzMzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/2448353332","actor":{"login":"sibyl1956","id":15240619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwNjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15240619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956","html_url":"https://github.com/sibyl1956","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-28T20:32:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2448353335,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NDgzNTMzMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/2448353335","actor":{"login":"sibyl1956","id":15240619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwNjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15240619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956","html_url":"https://github.com/sibyl1956","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibyl1956/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-28T20:32:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/comments/506868483","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scibert/issues/32#issuecomment-506868483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/32","id":506868483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjg2ODQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-28T20:34:01Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T20:34:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'm
