That is, take a raw average of the reported metrics:  F1-I-INT, F1-I-OUT, F1-I-PAR, which are the relevant PICO tags.   As for the others, F1-measure-overall and average-F1 are the two metrics to look at.  F1-measure-overall corresponds to a span-level F1 measure so it's used for all the sequence tagging tasks (e.g. NER).  average-F1 is used for the text/relation classification tasks.  The only exception is Chemprot is typically reported using micro-F1, which is  computationally equivalent to 'accuracy', which is one of the Allenlp metrics.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/comments/668451319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shizhediao","id":18120087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTIwMDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18120087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao","html_url":"https://github.com/shizhediao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3619078422,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzYxOTA3ODQyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/3619078422","actor":{"login":"shizhediao","id":18120087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTIwMDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18120087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao","html_url":"https://github.com/shizhediao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-04T08:11:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3619078427,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYxOTA3ODQyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/3619078427","actor":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-04T08:11:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3619078428,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MTkwNzg0Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/3619078428","actor":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-04T08:11:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
