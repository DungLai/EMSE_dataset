We released SciBERT tensorflow/pytorch weights with the intention that researchers would use them within their existing tensorflow/pytorch projects that already know how to consume BERT.  It's fine if you haven't used AllenNLP before, but it's a bit hard to help you unless you have an existing project based around BERT already.  \r\n\r\nIf you haven't already picked up a modeling framework, I recommend adopting AllenNLP and going through the tutorial first.  Once you have an environment setup that can successfully train *any* AllenNLP model, it should be straightforward to help you pick the specific model you're interested in & get the SciBERT weights plugged in.
