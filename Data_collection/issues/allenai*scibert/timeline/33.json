My recommendation is to first see if whatever tool you're using works for BERTBase.  If it doesn't work with that, then it won't work with SciBERT.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/comments/485021076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2448332882,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ0ODMzMjg4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/2448332882","actor":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-28T20:22:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
