But `export CUDA_DEVICE=0` in _train_allennlp_local.sh_ means only gpu0 is used. So where do I need to modify to utilize multiple GPUs?\r\n\r\nMultiple gpu finetuning has been implemented in the codes using `DataParallel` from `torch`.\r\nMaybe you can change `export CUDA_DEVICE=0` to `export CUDA_DEVICE=0,1,2,3`\r\nand you should change the way parsing this argument `cuda_device` in config files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/comments/911320366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fan-hd","id":9999463,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTk0NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9999463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd","html_url":"https://github.com/fan-hd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan-hd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6426444218,"node_id":"CE_lADOCgmL1M4q7SWdzwAAAAF_C8G6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/events/6426444218","actor":{"login":"chloefresh","id":38456889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDU2ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38456889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh","html_url":"https://github.com/chloefresh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chloefresh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-13T11:07:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
