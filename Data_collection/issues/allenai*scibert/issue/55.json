We have trained a model for our system to generate PICO tags and it is working great. I have a few doubts before greenlighting it for production. It would be really helpful if the authors could answer them.\r\n\r\nThe requirements.txt mentions an editable install of a specific branch from the author's fork of the official AllenNLP package. Currently, that is 240+ commits behind the official repository.\r\n \r\n1. Should we just stick the requirement.txt and not bother about the official packages at all? Or is there a plan to include the work in the fork to the main project. How is it going to be handled?\r\n2. Why the editable mode why don't we just install as a regular dependency?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
