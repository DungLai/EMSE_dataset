While pytorch or allenai would be preferred, tensorflow code is fine.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"shizhediao","id":18120087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTIwMDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18120087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao","html_url":"https://github.com/shizhediao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhediao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/99/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
