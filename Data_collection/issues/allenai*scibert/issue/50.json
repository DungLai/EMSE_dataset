It seems that bc5cdr and sciie are `IOB1` (single token spans are `I-Entity`), while JNLPBA and NCBI-disease are `BIOUL` (single token spans are `B-Entity`).\r\n\r\nMaybe this should also be a variable in the training script instead of hardcoded, and the README could direct users to change it according to the dataset?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan\r\n\r\nPS: Curiously, I used the training script for bc5cdr with the wrong coding scheme (the default `BIOUL` in the ner.json config) and the performance was very close to what you report in the paper (\"test_f1-measure-overall\": 0.8881). Any idea why? Is it irrelevant as long as dev and test are in the same format? Could the model learn a coding 'fix' during training?","closed_by":{"login":"kyleclo","id":13603748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAzNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13603748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo","html_url":"https://github.com/kyleclo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyleclo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/50/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
