Are there code snip bits for easily running inference on your own dataset and just seeing how it classifies? I tried to use the huggingface models and the AWS deploy code but Im not sure how to use if for a PICO task, let alone interpret the text classification outputs it gives, which just seem to be \"LABEL_0\" or \"LABEL_1\". Any help on this would be much appreciated!
