It looks like the accuracy includes all relations available in Chemprot, while the original publication of Chemprot and other relevant publications like bioBERT evaluated over only 5 relations ( specifically, AGONIST, ANTAGONIST, SUBSTRATE, UPREGULATOR and DOWNREGULATOR ). So I wonder whether the SciBERT paper reported the accuracy (83.64) over these 5 relations, or all relations?
