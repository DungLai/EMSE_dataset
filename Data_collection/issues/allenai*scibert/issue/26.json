Then I checked the JNLPBA dataset and it seems that all `-DOCSTART-\tO` lines were also counted, which is I think a bit redundant.\r\n\r\nThe number of training and development sentences is also a bit different than the values reported in the BioBERT paper. The BioBERT uses a split of 14,690 / 3,856 / 3,856, whereas the provided data in this repository uses a split of 16,807 /  1,739 / 3,856. Could you confirm this?\r\n\r\nThanks + regards,\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
