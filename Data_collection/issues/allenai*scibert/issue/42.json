I see the footnote that this is 2.5x slower, but that doesn't seem *that* prohibitive (is all relative, of course!), given that the original BERT paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf, section 5.4) observed a 1.5 point bump from fine-tuning on the downstream tasks.\r\n\r\n2) Any plans to issue a second iteration of the paper with fine-tuning?  Seems like there might be a lot of upside left on the floor here.\r\n\r\nNot a criticism, just 1) trying to understand how far SciBERT pushes things, in-domain, and 2) think this is neat and would love to see you push things all the way.  :)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
