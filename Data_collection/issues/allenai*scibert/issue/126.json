We extracted text from a GIEC report and build a Knowledge Graph from it. We wanted to know if it was possible to use a pre-trained version of SciBERT and train it with our own KG. \r\n\r\nAs we are pretty new to NLP, we don't have any idea of the feasibility of this, or how to start with ?\r\n\r\nWould any of you have any indication ?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHugo M ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
