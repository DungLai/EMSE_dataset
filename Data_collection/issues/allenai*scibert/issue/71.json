However, it would be ideal to be able to load it without having to download beforehand. \r\n\r\nAs of 2.2.2, if a model is uploaded to the hub, https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_sharing.html, transformers automatically recognises it as a pre-trained model, and you can load it with `from_pretrained` by only using its name, without needing to download beforehand.\r\n\r\nShould it be the case that the scibert models should be uploaded to the hub? FYI - I created issue https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/2619 at the transformers library, and they pointed to uploading to the hub as the best practice.","closed_by":{"login":"aCampello","id":27929341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTI5MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27929341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello","html_url":"https://github.com/aCampello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aCampello/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/71/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/71/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
