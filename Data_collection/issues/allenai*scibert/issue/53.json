I have a question cum feature request. \r\n\r\nQ1. \r\nIs scibert predicting the entity for each token or for a sentence (bunch of tokens) from the test set?\r\n\r\nQ2. Is the accuracy/f1 score calculated at the \"span label\" level (PER) or \"IOB label + span label\" level (B-PER)?\r\n\r\nIf we have a feature to save the predictions (in addition to outputting just the acc/f1 score) on the test data when if the test is enabled during training, we can figure out the above such questions ourselves.\r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
