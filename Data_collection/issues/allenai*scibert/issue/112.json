Using the hyperparameters as described in your paper, I've been able to get an F1 score of 0.51 (Test Set) as detailed by the results from running the script provided in your codebase. Please advise if any further hyperparameter tuning or other tweaking is required to reproduce the F1 score as mentioned in your paper.\r\nThanks in advance!
