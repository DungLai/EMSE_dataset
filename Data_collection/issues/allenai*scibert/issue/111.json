I am attempting to replicate some of the experiments described in the paper. Do you have any recommendations for using BERT-Base with the `train_allennlp_local.sh` script. The PyTorch implementation of the model that I am using seems to require more files than just `vocab.txt`, `bert_config.json`, and `pytorch_model.bin`. Any help that you could provide would be greatly appreciated!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
