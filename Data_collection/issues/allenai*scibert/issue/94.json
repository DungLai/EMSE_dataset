On JNLPBA, however, we typically see micro average being ~4pp lower than the macro average and in the logs in your GitHub repository (https://github.com/allenai/scibert/tree/master/results) SciBERT seems to achieve micro F1-scores in the range of 77%. Thus, Iâ€™m wondering whether the macro in your paper might be a typo?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/94/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
