However in my case (multi player card game) it is very expensive to look ahead very far. For this reason I want to ask you if you know if there is a parallel mcts algorithm available? \r\n\r\nI just found this one for CUDA written in C++ :\r\nhttp://15418-final.github.io/parallelizedMCTS_web/ \r\n\r\nI would however like to have one in python.
