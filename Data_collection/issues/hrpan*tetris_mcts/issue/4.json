I've also tried changing the pyTetris.h includes to pyTetris.cpp but it still gives me the same kind of error (pyTetris.cpp: No such file or directory). Am I doing something wrong here?\r\n\r\n(Btw, I can include pyTetris in the python shell after installing it)\r\n\r\nThanks for the help in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hrpan/tetris_mcts/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hrpan/tetris_mcts/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
