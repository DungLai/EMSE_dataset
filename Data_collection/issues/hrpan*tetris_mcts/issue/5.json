I'm excited to explore it and see if I can make a similar agent for different games. However, there seems to be an issue with **caffe2** and **PyTorch** installation, as my Python version (3.8) does not seem to have the versions mentioned in the requirements.txt\r\n\r\nI have tried installing it with Python 3.8, 3.6 and 3.5 but **caffe2** just doesn't install (saying _0.8.1_ is not available). Even the version which is available (**caffe2** _0.5.0a0.dev100_) doesn't install due to some PyTorch issues. Could you please elaborate on what version of Python was used for this project? Also, did you have CUDA enabled for PyTorch (I have a CPU version ðŸ˜ž )?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for taking time to even read this stuff. I'd be very happy if I can just run your project on my PC.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hrpan","id":18377357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzc3MzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18377357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan","html_url":"https://github.com/hrpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hrpan/tetris_mcts/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hrpan/tetris_mcts/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
