One reason MCTS is hard to parallelize is because UCB-based policies are sequential in nature. \r\n\r\nAs for your case, the whole purpose of TD-Learning (or other RL approaches) is to learn the long-term expected rewards so that you don't have to search very deep in the tree to find a good policy. Although it may take quite a while if your game is complicated.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hrpan/tetris_mcts/issues/comments/589984167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hrpan","id":18377357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzc3MzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18377357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan","html_url":"https://github.com/hrpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hrpan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
