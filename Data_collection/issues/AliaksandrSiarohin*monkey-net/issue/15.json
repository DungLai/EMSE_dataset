However, due to lack of data, I am trying to infer from using moving-gif weights provided with the code. After adding a white background to all frames, I tried to reconstruct the video giving the first frame of the driving video as the source image. I observed that apart from the generator not able to generate convincing images, sometimes the key points were estimated incorrectly. Is there any sort of relation in which the keypoint detector depends on the object (mostly quadrupeds in moving-gif) the network was trained on.","closed_by":{"login":"TsainGra","id":24549065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQ5MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24549065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra","html_url":"https://github.com/TsainGra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TsainGra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
