Didn't guarantee ``s1 - s2`` is positive before sqrt:\r\nhttps://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/blob/7c116b6591e45421f78d3ecdbc224445ada4ac63/modules/util.py#L254\r\n\r\n2. The singular value can sometimes become too small, causing the output explodes to ``inf``. Adding an epsilon to the denominator can help to stabilize it:\r\nhttps://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/blob/7c116b6591e45421f78d3ecdbc224445ada4ac63/modules/keypoint_detector.py#L65","closed_by":{"login":"hubert0527","id":17472642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcyNjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17472642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527","html_url":"https://github.com/hubert0527","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubert0527/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
