I have some questions about the kp2gaussian and gaussian2kp in keypoint_detector.py\r\n1. Are these functions invertible? I use a pretrained hourglass network to extract heatmap, by feed it to gaussion2kp and kp2gaussion, the output become weird. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10545746/70422745-30465e00-1aa7-11ea-9465-849b9d29a10d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. To calculate the mean of heatmap, why apply \"sum\" function on it? \r\n`mean = (heatmap * grid).sum(dim=(3, 4))`\r\n\r\n3. If I have use pretrained landmark detector, for example, facial landmark detector, how should I modify the code?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
