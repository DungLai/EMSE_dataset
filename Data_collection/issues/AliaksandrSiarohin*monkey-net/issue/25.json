Referring to the **make_coordinate_grid** method _under /modules/util.py_. Please let me know if I am missing something.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"saandeepa93","id":37085656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDg1NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37085656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93","html_url":"https://github.com/saandeepa93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saandeepa93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
