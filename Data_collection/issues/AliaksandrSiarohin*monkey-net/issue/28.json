The overall U-net architecture is pretty much the same.\r\n\r\nCan you please provide any suggestion to improve this?\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AliaksandrSiarohin/monkey-net/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
