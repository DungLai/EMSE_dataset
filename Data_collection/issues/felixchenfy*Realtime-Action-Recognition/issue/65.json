While the input frame rate is not fixed. \r\n\r\nI mean, for example, given a set of frames from the same speed of action video of: 10fps and 20fps, you may have totally different velocity from your function (roughly 2:1 in this case). \r\n\r\nSo, from my understanding, you should better take frame rate as parameter of function to calculate your joint velocities. Correct me if I am wrong.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/65/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/65/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
