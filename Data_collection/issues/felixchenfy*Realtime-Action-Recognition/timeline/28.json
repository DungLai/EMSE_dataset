I have disabled this function (Please search for `ADD_NOISE = False` in `src/s3_preprocess_features.py`), tested it on myself, and updated the repo.  Could you please try it again? There should be no big problem now.\r\n\r\n(2) Another potential reason is: If the image resolution is low and the model `mobilenet_thin` is used, the detected joints might be inaccurate and each joint will look like \"trembling\", which might cause a static motion similar to a movement.
