I think the training shouldn't be slow even using CPU, because the features used for training are human's positions, whose feature dimensionality is pretty small. It should just take seconds.\r\n   - What is slow is detecting human skeletons from the training images. You'll need GPU to make it faster.\r\n- No, it's not supported ---  I used the sklearn library's methods which don't support pausing/resuming the trainig","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/comments/1126666092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felixchenfy","id":22253529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjUzNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22253529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
