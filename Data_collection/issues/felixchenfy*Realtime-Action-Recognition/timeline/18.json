See `3. Program structure` `Diagram`.\r\n\r\nI paste the added contents below:\r\n\r\nSystem diagram:\r\n![system_diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22253529/67788845-067a3000-fa41-11e9-9c8b-29a325ec1594.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTrouble shooting:\r\n  * How to change features?\r\n\r\n    In [utils/lib_feature_proc.py](https://github.com/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/blob/master/utils/lib_feature_proc.py), in the `class FeatureGenerator`, change the function `def add_cur_skeleton`! \r\n    \r\n    The function reads in a raw skeleton and outputs the feature generated from this raw skeleton as well as previous skeletons. The feature will then be saved to `features_X.csv` by the script [s3_preprocess_features.py](https://github.com/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/blob/master/src/s3_preprocess_features.py) for the next training step.\r\n\r\n  * How to include joints of the head?\r\n\r\n    You need to change the aforementioned `add_cur_skeleton` function. \r\n    \r\n    I suggest you to write a new function to extract the head features, and then append them to the returned variable(feature) of `add_cur_skeleton`.\r\n\r\n    Please read `def retrain_only_body_joints` in `utils/lib_feature_proc.py` if you want to add the head joints.\r\n\r\n  * How to change the classifier to RNN?\r\n\r\n    There are two major changes to do:\r\n    \r\n    First, change the aforementioned `add_cur_skeleton`. Instead of manually extracing time-serials features as does by the current script, you may simply stack the input skeleton with previous skeletons and then output it.\r\n\r\n    Second, change the `def __init__` and `def predict` function of `class ClassifierOfflineTrain` in [utils/lib_classifier.py](https://github.com/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/blob/master/utils/lib_classifier.py) to add an RNN model.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/comments/547518140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felixchenfy","id":22253529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjUzNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22253529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2752943455,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1Mjk0MzQ1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/events/2752943455","actor":{"login":"jacksonj393","id":56730172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzMwMTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56730172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393","html_url":"https://github.com/jacksonj393","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T16:43:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2752943456,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTI5NDM0NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/events/2752943456","actor":{"login":"jacksonj393","id":56730172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzMwMTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56730172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393","html_url":"https://github.com/jacksonj393","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonj393/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T16:43:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/comments/548598193","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/18#issuecomment-548598193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/18","id":548598193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODU5ODE5Mw==","user":{"login":"felixchenfy","id":22253529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjUzNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22253529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixch
