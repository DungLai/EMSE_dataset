Basically, you need to read the code, find the files that define the feature and model, and then change them. It will be lots of changes. Sorry about that. \r\n\r\nI copied it here for your convinience:\r\n\r\n\r\nTrouble shooting:\r\n  * How to change features?\r\n\r\n    In [utils/lib_feature_proc.py](utils/lib_feature_proc.py), in the `class FeatureGenerator`, change the function `def add_cur_skeleton`! \r\n    \r\n    The function reads in a raw skeleton and outputs the feature generated from this raw skeleton as well as previous skeletons. The feature will then be saved to `features_X.csv` by the script [s3_preprocess_features.py](src/s3_preprocess_features.py) for the next training step.\r\n\r\n  * How to include joints of the head?\r\n\r\n    You need to change the aforementioned `add_cur_skeleton` function. \r\n    \r\n    I suggest you to write a new function to extract the head features, and then append them to the returned variable(feature) of `add_cur_skeleton`.\r\n\r\n    Please read `def retrain_only_body_joints` in `utils/lib_feature_proc.py` if you want to add the head joints.\r\n\r\n  * How to change the classifier to RNN?\r\n\r\n    There are two major changes to do:\r\n    \r\n    First, change the aforementioned `add_cur_skeleton`. Instead of manually extracing time-serials features as does by the current script, you may simply stack the input skeleton with previous skeletons and then output it.\r\n\r\n    Second, change the `def __init__` and `def predict` function of `class ClassifierOfflineTrain` in [utils/lib_classifier.py](utils/lib_classifier.py) to add an RNN model.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/comments/620333761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felixchenfy","id":22253529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjUzNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22253529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/comments/621046998","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/47#issuecomment-621046998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/47","id":621046998,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTA0Njk5OA==","user":{"login":"Yorkzhang19961122","id":29726939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzI2OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29726939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122","html_url":"https://github.com/Yorkzhang19961122","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yorkzhang19961122/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-29T07:53:26Z","updated_at":"2020-04-29T07:53:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank
