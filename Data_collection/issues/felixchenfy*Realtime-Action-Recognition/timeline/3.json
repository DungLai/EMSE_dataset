How to run: Training\r\n\r\n**1).** First, detect skeleton from training images and save result to txt:\r\n> $ python src/run_detector.py --source txtscript\r\n\r\n* Input: Images are from \"**data/source_images3/**\". See [this file](data/download_link.md) for downloading.\r\n* Output:  \r\n    (1) Skeleton positions of each image in \"**src/skeleton_data/skeletons5/**\" in txt format.  \r\n    (2) Images with drawn skeleton, saved in \"**src/skeleton_data/skeletons5_images/**\".\r\n\r\n**2).** Second, put skeleton from multiple txt into a single txt file:\r\n> $ python src/scripts/skeletons_info_generator.py\r\n\r\n* Input: \"**src/skeleton_data/skeletons5/**\". \r\n* Output:  \"**src/skeleton_data/skeletons5_info.txt**\"\r\n\r\n**3).** Third, open jupyter notebook, and run this file: \"**src/Train.ipynb**\".  \r\nThe trained model will be saved to \"**model/trained_classifier.pickle**\".\r\n\r\nNow, it's ready to run the real-time demo from your web camera.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/comments/514635270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felixchenfy","id":22253529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjUzNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22253529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2745783118,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc0NTc4MzExOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/felixchenfy/Realtime-Action-Recognition/issues/events/2745783118","actor":{"login":"felixchenfy","id":22253529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjUzNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22253529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy","html_url":"https://github.com/felixchenfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixchenfy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-26T01:11:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
