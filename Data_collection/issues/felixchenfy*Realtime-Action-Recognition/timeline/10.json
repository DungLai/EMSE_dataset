Hi.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, since your inference speed is 5 fps, you need to lower down the video input to 5 fps (no matter how fast the original video streaming is). You can do this either by triggering the video frame at 5 fps, or manually sampling the video frame at 5 fps.\r\n\r\nAs for the FEATURE_T_LEN, since your shortest action is only 0.5s, which corresponding to only 0.5s*5fps=2.5 frame. So you may use 2 frame for FEATURE_T_LEN.
