It appears to only do this when attempting to classify the modified actions (i.e. it will run fine until I do the action at which point, I receive the error below). \r\n\r\nFor reference, I have trained the model on only two actions ('come here' and 'wave'). I have also attempted to run it when I have only trained it on one of those actions and received the same error. I am wondering if the program is designed to have exactly nine actions, in which case I would need to add more. As I understand it, the error is due to a mismatch in array size. Not sure how to fix, I would appreciate any guidance :)\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File
