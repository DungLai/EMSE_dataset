Only we'll be implementing the `dump_fd` method in this one.\r\n\r\nThe [`configparser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) library will be helpful here, since it parses `.ini` files.\r\n\r\nSince we're working with file objects in `load_fd` and `dump_fd`, rather than filenames, we'll want to use the [`read_file`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser.read_file) method within `load_fd` .\r\n\r\nIn `dump_fd`, we'll likely want to use [`read_dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser.read_dict) to create a `Configparser`. Both `load_fd` and `dump_fd` should have local variables which are an instance of `Configparser`. We don't want to make it class local because if features in an individual record are deleted then they would still show up in the output.\r\n\r\nYou'll want to make sure to call `record.features()` and using that as the data to save for the record. Also assume when loading that you're loading the feature data. Each `[section]` should be used as a record. With the name of the section being the `key` for that record.\r\n\r\nMake sure to write lots of comments, since this will be used as the example for another tutorial on Sources (see issue https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/282).\r\n\r\nHere is the `idx1` source as an example.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/155c114da35b80d5a17c96eece5c45dc8a6322c5/dffml/source/idx1.py#L6-L56","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
