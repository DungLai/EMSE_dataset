Pain Point\r\n\r\nMany functions execute commands using the `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` method and have a similar structure , this is causing duplication of similar functions at various places. \r\n\r\nReference : https://github.com/intel/dffml/pull/1076#discussion_r608004534 \r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nImplement a generic function to execute commands using the `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` method  which should probably go in `util/os.py` , it should support the most commonly used functions like `stdout`, `stderr` , `return code` , etc.","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1078/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
