I encountered this problem when using the example given in XGBClassifier model (Iris dataset). Should the scorer auto-cast predictions to integer, or is this the responsibility of the plugin contributor?\r\n\r\n## How to reproduce\r\n\r\nBasically just the example given in model/xgboost/dffml_model_xgboost/xgbclassifier.py\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I modified the scorer to cast to integer, I got near 1.0 or at 1.0 accuracy, depending on hyperparameters chosen. \r\n\r\n## Image of bug\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51947676/171825839-7581a681-7313-4376-a524-bb9a9f742758.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
