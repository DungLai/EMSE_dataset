Make plugins list for 1st, 2nd and 3rd party plugins.\r\n2. Add them to a JSON file in dffml/dffml/plugins.json\r\n    - Plugins by levels.\r\n    - Link to repo.\r\n    - ~~Tutorials linked~~/fetch from the tutorials.\r\n3. Modify scripts in DFFML.\r\n4. Move scikit-learn to dffml-org (1st Party Plugin):\r\n    - Write Generic CI for plugins.\r\n        - Run tests on different OS.\r\n        - lint.\r\n        - Tutorials test.\r\n        - Check collision/compatibility with 1st parties: This should be done in the core repo\r\n        since it isn't something that breaks the plugin but the DFFML release process.\r\n        - docstring build + tests.\r\n5. CI changes, DFFML:\r\n    - Build docs for main repo.\r\n    - Check and build docs for plugins (on commit not PR)\r\n    - Tutorials test.\r\n    - Compatibility check:\r\n        - Run `dffml service dev install` /  `dffml install -level 1`\r\n            - If it works: Can be released.\r\n6. Difficult part - Tutorials!:\r\n    - Simple way out is to list the dependencies for each tutorial and check them on there respective plugin repo.\r\n    - Generate a tag from that workflow and put it on top of the tutorial.\r\n    - pip install for each tutorial on top\r\n\r\nNeed to figure out:\r\n- On commit to dffml main repo: How to check whether tutorial would pass with current plugins. Plugins would essentially be green until they merge a commit after dffml.\r\n\r\nPoints to discuss:\r\n- Someway to build the docs in plugins and fetch in main repo when built.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
