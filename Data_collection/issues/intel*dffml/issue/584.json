run the dataflow on each `repo.features()`, using `self.config.features` as the input definitions.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor feature in self.config.features:\r\n   feature_defintion = Definition(feature.NAME, str(feature.dtype()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nfeature.dtype() will be a class, such as int, or float.\r\n\r\nTake those `feature_definition`s and create `Input`s out of them.\r\n\r\nThen run the dataflow provided to you in the config, and pass all the features, as `inputs`.\r\n\r\nExamples: https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/plugins/dffml_operation.html#db-query-insert\r\n\r\nUse the output (`results`) as the new `repo.features()`, which means you'll call `repo.evaluated(results)`,
