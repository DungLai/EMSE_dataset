It `yield`s the context that was running and the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWe need to add another part to a data flow so we can yield `Input`s. The event\r\ntype would be `INPUT`, and in the DataFlow we should add a section for events.\r\nIn the events section for `INPUT` events we could specify when an\r\ninput should be yielded. We use the inputs section to specify which transitions\r\nbetween operations should be yielded.\r\n\r\nThis will enable us to do things like running a DataFlow and not only `yield`ing\r\nthe results, but data that's moving through the network as the DataFlow is\r\nrunning. This allows developers to build applications that show the progress of\r\na DataFlow as it's running.\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- Refactoring a large codebase\r\n- Asyncio knowledge would be very helpful here\r\n\r\n## Difficulty\r\n\r\nIntermediate/Hard\r\n\r\n## Related Readings\r\n\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/gsoc/2021/index.html\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Read the contributing guidelines\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/index.html\r\n- Go through the quickstart\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/quickstart/model.html\r\n- Go through the data flow related docs and tutorials\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/tutorials/dataflows/index.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/integration.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/shouldi.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/dataflows.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/mnist.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/flower17/flower17.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/webhook/index.html\r\n- Read about what data flows are and how they work\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/concepts/index.html#dataflows\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/concepts/dataflow.html\r\n- Come up with a basic example where the user will see inputs moving through the\r\n  network.\r\n  - Make it simple and include a few operations.\r\n  - Get the DataFlow running.\r\n- Look at the code in `dffml/df/memory.py` and understand how it relates to the\r\n  docs covering DataFlows conceptually.\r\n- Plan out what all needs to change within `dffml/df/memory.py` and the other\r\n  code and examples that would change as a result.\r\n\r\n## Potential Mentors\r\n\r\n- [John Andersen](https://github.com/pdxjohnny)\r\n- [Saksham Arora](https://github.com/sakshamarora1)\r\n\r\n## Tracking and Discussion\r\n\r\nThis project is related to the following issues.
