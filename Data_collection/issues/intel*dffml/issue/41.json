Similar to how the `Features` class wraps a set of `Feature`s we should have a `BaseOperationImplementationNetworks` and `BaseOperationImplementationNetworksContext` which would be a `AsyncContextManagerList` of `BaseOperationImplementationNetworkContext`s and have a `dispatch` method which check's each `BaseOperationImplementationNetworkContext` to see if it contains the implementation of the requested operation, if so then `dispatch` it within that. If not then move on to the next `BaseOperationImplementationNetworkContext` and so forth until we have found one which contains the `OperationImplemenation`, and therefore can `dispatch` it.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
