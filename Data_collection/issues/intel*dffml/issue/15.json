You can read all about what this means at http://python-gsoc.org/.  This issue, and any others tagged `gsoc` and `project` are not generally available bugs, but related to project ideas for GSoC.\r\n\r\n# Project Idea: File Source Compression\r\n\r\n**Project description:**\r\n\r\nDFFML's initial release includes a `FileSource` which saves and loads data from files using the `load_fd` and `dump_fd` methods.\r\n\r\n> JSON Example\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/dd8007d0c9f8c58c35c94faf148e2b5d6ce4c101/dffml/source/json.py#L19-L27\r\n\r\nFor the `open` method of `FileSource`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/dd8007d0c9f8c58c35c94faf148e2b5d6ce4c101/dffml/source/file.py#L36-L44\r\n\r\nAllow for reading and writing the following file formats, transparently (so without subclasses having to do anything) to any source which is a subclass of `FileSource`.\r\n\r\n- [x] gzip (by @yashlamba)\r\n- [x] bz2\r\n- [x] lzma\r\n- [x] zip\r\n\r\n**Skills:** Python, git\r\n**Difficulty level:** Easy\r\n\r\n**Related Readings/Links:**\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.python.org/3/library/archiving.html for documentation\r\n\r\n**Potential mentors:** @pdxjohnny\r\n\r\n**Getting Started:** Figure out how to do one of the file types, probably gzip (as that probably is as simple as using https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#gzip.GzipFile if the filename ends in `.gz`) then move on to the rest. For now just make modifications directly to the `FileSource` class. We may have you split out the logic later, but don't worry about another class for now.\r\n\r\n**What we want to see in your application:** Describe how you intend to solve the problem, and give us some \"stretch goals\", maybe implement a remote file source which reads form URLs. Don't forget to include some time for building appropriate tests.","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
