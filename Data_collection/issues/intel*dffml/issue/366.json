You can read all about what this means at http://python-gsoc.org/.  This issue, and any others tagged `gsoc` and `project` are not general bugs, but project ideas which one could choose to write a proposal for. Issue tagged as `gsoc` and `project` can also be used as an example for what the scope of an idea for a project proposal might look like.\r\n\r\n# Project Idea: Doctest-able Examples\r\n\r\n**Project description:**\r\nWe have a lot of tests, and a lot of command line usage examples. However, we don't have a lot of examples of how to use the plethora of classes, methods, and functions that are provided. The goal of this project is to create code examples for as much of the codebase as possible. We recently switched over numpy style docstrings. So adding information on the arguments, parameters, and return values of things would also be good, but is not a must for this project. The goal is to have working examples that can be tested via the sphinx doctest plugin. This will make it so that users can look at the docs for anything the github pages site, copy paste it into a Python file and it'll work (since the examples you write will be tested on every CI run).\r\n\r\n**Skills:** Python, git\r\n**Difficulty level:** Intermediate\r\n\r\n**Related Readings/Links:**\r\n\r\n- https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html\r\n- https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/336\r\n- https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/345\r\n\r\n**Potential mentors:** @pdxjohnny, @sudharsana-kjl\r\n\r\n**Getting Started:**\r\nThe tests have most of the code you'll need, you'll just need to adapt it from test code into example code.\r\n\r\nA good first target would be the functions under the [High Level API Docs](https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/api/high_level.html) as you can reference the quickstart guide for their usage.\r\n\r\nThe `scripts/doctest.sh` can be used to run the doctests.\r\n\r\n**What we want to see in your application:**\r\nDescribe how you intend to solve the problem, and give us some \"stretch goals\", for example define some percentage of functions with testable examples as \"success\", and some percentage as \"exceeds\".","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/366/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
