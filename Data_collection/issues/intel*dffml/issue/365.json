You can read all about what this means at http://python-gsoc.org/.  This issue, and any others tagged `gsoc` and `project` are not general bugs, but project ideas which one could choose to write a proposal for. Issue tagged as `gsoc` and `project` can also be used as an example for what the scope of an idea for a project proposal might look like.\r\n\r\n# Project Idea: shouldi Meta Static Analysis Tool\r\n\r\n**Project description:**\r\nWe have a tool called shouldi. The goal here is to make shouldi into a better meta static analysis tool that can handle multiple languages (right now it just analyses Python). The end result will be  a generic tool that we can point at any codebase which gives us a report back on what static analysis tools for the language of that codebase think about it.\r\n\r\n**Skills:** Python, git\r\n**Difficulty level:** Intermediate\r\n\r\n**Related Readings/Links:**\r\n\r\n- [How shouldi was written and works](https://intel.github.io/dffml/tutorials/operations.html)\r\n- [Tracking steps to make shouldi](https://github.com/intel/dffml/projects/3)\r\n\r\n**Potential mentors:** @pdxjohnny, @yashlamba\r\n\r\n**Getting Started:**\r\nYou'll want to go through the shouldi tutorial and then start writing operations that run static analysis tools for various languages. Then you'll want to do #364. Check the project board for more issues.\r\n\r\n**What we want to see in your application:**\r\nDescribe how you intend to solve the problem, and give us some \"stretch goals\", maybe \r\nyou'd want to attempt to get this working with C projects. Don't forget to include some time for building appropriate tests. Identify what static analysers you'll use, and explain how you'll aggregate and present their output in a useful format. The goal is to inform the user as to if there are potential security risks to the software they want to use.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/365/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
