I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on the project’s history, and update everyone on what we hope is its future.\r\n \r\nThe project started on December 26th of 2017 when Diego Heath outlined the original architecture. Building on [John L. Whiteman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABkMqIB8n3jdD8CvQGruKnxmDFrj3BogKI)’s work and integrating with [Rodrigo Pulido](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAz-xvYBErzaAruQgRrQkpJ01koI_uqz_X4)'s web app, we set out on a mission to make a robot (George as [Tiberius Hefflin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAZbm7gB00oiKeXS4zn2jRrgm2KwuFmY1X4) named him) do our most dreaded of tasks, looking at open source projects! We finalized integration with the Allowlist Tool somewhere around June of 2018, and the project open sourced on March 7th of 2019. We then presented the work at BSides PDX in October of 2019, along with revamped data flow architecture which was inspired by the name [Jessica Marz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAApN2kBjm3FCC_hyG_-Euu_evjAeqzDdAs) gave us, and with advice from [Arjan van de Ven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAfbhEBvvJBLKggKZyx4LP-YtIQ8twCXUc). Just wanted to share with everyone all since many of you were a huge part of making the project happen. We couldn’t have done it without everyone’s feedback and guidance thought the years.\r\n\r\nThings have gone great the past few years being in Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Big thanks to [Terri Oda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAM3-pQBwQnTGhmAYKECiofPSYzQfiSgZ-s) who leads the Python Software Foundation (PSF) GSoC org and helped us navigate that process and hosting us as a sub-org. We’ve mentored 8 students, with several of those students having been mentors themselves after their time as students. Most of the students have gone on to have full time jobs, we’re lucky that they still make time to be a part of the community and mentor others. The project has been a space for students to learn about software development and machine learning. The project has also been a place for me to learn about running an open source project, CI/CD, documentation, and most importantly building a community. I’m grateful to all who have been involved as I know my learning curve was at times rocky.\r\n \r\nThe students who’d mentored during GSoC the past few years are likely / hopefully soon going to take over maintenance of the project going forward soon. Terri and I meet with them and they have been working on their governance documentation for their org: https://github.com/builtree. Under their leadership, the project will hopefully reach it’s beta milestone within the next two years. I’m excited to see what the future holds. I know they will continue the spirt of the community and build amazing things.\r\n \r\nThanks again for all the advice along the way. And a big thanks to our GSoC students who have made the project what it is today!\r\n\r\n- Yash Lamba\r\n- Sudharsana K J L\r\n- Hashim Chaudry\r\n- Saksham Arora\r\n- Sudhanshu Kumar\r\n- Saahil Ali\r\n- Himanshu Tripathi\r\n- Aghin Shah Alin","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1304/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
