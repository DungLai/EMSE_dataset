We'll want this to be the `shouldi deptree` command (as opposed to `shouldi install`)\r\n\r\nIt's currently in a state where it can grab package names out of setup.py files. It also needs to be able to grab them out of `setup.cfg` files and requirements.txt files.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that's missing is the version number of the package. Right now the latest version of each package is being downloaded. We need to check if the package was pinned to a version and download that version (if `example_package==0.3.1` for example we'd download version 0.3.1 of example_package). Come up with reasonable ways to handle all the following cases: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50842265/12310488\r\n\r\nThere is also a new output operation that needs to be made for this work. It's the `Tree` output operation. It's not working at the moment. What it should do is output a `dict` similar to the way config structures work with their use of [`plugin` and `config`](https://intel.github.io/dffml/main/contributing/codebase.html#config) (you'll see what I'm about when you read the existing code.\r\n\r\n- References\r\n  - https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/\r\n  - https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/alice/docs/tutorials/rolling_alice/0001_coach_alice/0001_down_the_dependency_rabbit_hole_again.md\r\n    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9puJiKKKS8&list=PLtzAOVTpO2jYt71umwc-ze6OmwwCIMnLw&t=871s\r\n  - https://github.com/pdxjohnny/use-cases/blob/openssf_metrics/openssf_metrics.md\r\n- Example files\r\n  - [`requirements-dev.txt`](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/3530ee0d20d1062605f82d1f5055f455f8c2c68f/requirements-dev.txt)\r\n  - [`service/http/setup.cfg`](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/3530ee0d20d1062605f82d1f5055f455f8c2c68f/service/http/setup.cfg\r\n)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/0a2e053f5f8e361054f329a3f763982fb1e4d1f7/examples/shouldi/tests/test_dep_tree.py#L1-L169","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
