need to modify the `predict` method in Model and in all the models to have a\nsignature as follows:\n\n\n```python\n    async def predict(self, sources: SourcesContext) -> AsyncIterator[Record]:\n```\n\nThe issue is that we aren't being passed a source so we can't call\n`sources.with_features`, which is important because it will validate that the\nrecords have the features we're trying to train on, as per f16248ba\n\nHere's a start at what needs to be done.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/dffml/high_level.py b/dffml/high_level.py\nindex f0456715..1017a909 100644\n---
