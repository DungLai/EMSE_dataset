You can read all about what this means at http://python-gsoc.org/.  This issue, and any others tagged `gsoc` and `project` are not generally available bugs, but related to project ideas for GSoC.\r\n\r\n# Project Idea: YOLO/darknet Model.\r\n\r\n**Project description:** \r\nDFFML's initial release included a Model for Tensorflows DNN estimator.\r\n\r\nYOLOv1,2,3 are awesome, it would be possible to wrap the YOLO work in a DFFML model and then it could be used within the DFFML API.\r\n\r\nThis involves filling out the Model abstract base class, just as the Tensorflow DNN does (use this as an example, or probably more as an education because this is likely to be rather different as we're working with images).\r\n\r\nTensorflow DNN: https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/master/model/tensorflow/dffml_model_tensorflow/model/dnn.py\r\n\r\nModel ABC:\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/dd8007d0c9f8c58c35c94faf148e2b5d6ce4c101/dffml/model/model.py#L30-L52\r\n\r\n**Skills:** Python, git\r\n**Difficulty level:** Hard\r\n\r\n**Related Readings/Links:**\r\n\r\n- https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/\r\n- https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet\r\n\r\nDemo video\r\n[![YOLOv3](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MPU2HistivI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPU2HistivI)\r\n\r\n**Potential mentors:** @pdxjohnny\r\n\r\n**Getting Started:** Start by copying the directory `model/tensorflow` to `model/darknet` and re-naming everything. Then move `dnn.py` to `darknet.py` (still re-naming everything) and make sure all the tests in the `model/darknet` directory still pass. Then you'll need to gut the `DNN` class and start replacing it with`subprocess.call` or `check_output` or whatever which will call out the the `darknet` binary which you compiled from Joseph's darknet repo for training, accuracy, and prediction (which is object detection in this case).\r\n\r\n**What we want to see in your application:** Describe how you intend to solve the problem, and give us some \"stretch goals\", perhaps use the Python C bindings instead of calling `subprocess` out to the `darknet` binary. Don't forget to include some time for building appropriate tests.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
