Please open a pull request and\nprefix the title with `WIP: ` so that we know it's a work in progress.

Figure out how to do linear regression with daal4py\n4. Modify the simple model provided when you create the model with the `dffml\n   service dev create model` command so that it uses daal4py.\n5.
