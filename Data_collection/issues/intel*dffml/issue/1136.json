All commits starting with `test` shouldn't contain any `test_`  in the rest of the parts \r\n  - Implement a new mutation which is only triggered when the commit starts with `test`\r\n- [x] 2. Substitutions are required for certain cases , where a word should translate to a path\r\n  - Add a substitution step which would replace such cases with their respective actual paths. \r\n- [ ] 3.  Checking for function/class names in files/folders\r\n  - Add a mutation which checks for a valid , file/directory path by recursively removing segments from the end of it until it finds a valid file/directory path , and then it searches for the removed segments in those files. \r\n  - for ex: In `util: net: cached_download(): Changed logging` , the mutation should remove the `cached_download()` part and check for `util/net` as a path with extensions mutation, and by this it will resolve to `dffml/util/net.py`, and then we've to search in that file for the removed part , i.e. `cached_download()` in this file, similarly if it resolved to a directory then we'd need to search all the files in that directory. \r\n  - This might sound complicated but it can be implemented easily as a `body_mutation` , we'd need this category for other things as well curretly we have only `prefix_mutations` and `suffix_mutations` only , this body mutation should only be applied if all the removed parts are found in their respective file/directory paths. \r\n- [ ] 4. Capitalization should be done for certain parts of the path\r\n  - Implement a body mutation to handle capitalisation of last and second last parts of the path. \r\n- [ ] 5. Special keywords should be ignored \r\n  - A simple body mutation to filter these words can be implemented.\r\n- [ ] 6. Investigate why [this](https://github.com/intel/dffml/pull/1174/checks?check_run_id=3308979214) is failing and fix it, related to 1. above\r\n- [ ] 7. Add support for \"Merge branch `x` into `y`\" type of commits.\r\n- [ ] 8. Add support for Reverted \" < some valid commit > \" type of commits.\r\n- [ ] 9. Add rule that all that checks whether the first letter of every section of the commit is capitalised \r\n- [ ] 10. Fix [the bug](https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/1136#issuecomment-922460785) introduced while implementing 1. above","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
