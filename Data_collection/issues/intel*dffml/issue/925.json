Users will be able to pass pandas DataFrame objects to the high level functions when this issue is completed. We need to implement a source that acts as a proxy (passthrough) between DFFML's APIs and a pandas DataFrame. This will let users pass DataFrames to high level functions without converting them to records first.\r\n\r\nThe `records()` and `record()` methods are working in this branch: https://github.com/pdxjohnny/dffml/commits/source_dataframe\r\n\r\nThe update method and the tests are still needed.\r\n\r\nThe changes also include a modification to the high level interface to instantiate an instance of the source if we detect that one of the high level sources has been passed a [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html) in an argument.","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
