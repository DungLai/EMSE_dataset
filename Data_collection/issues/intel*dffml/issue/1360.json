Having familiarised myself with the iris dataset, I feel like the process is largely procedural, and we could work on functionalities to building one code for implementing any generic dataset. \r\nThis would have long term implications, especially as it could help users drag and drop their own datasets. \r\n\r\n_Please mark this as an enhancement tag if approved_ @programmer290399 @pdxjohnny ","closed_by":{"login":"TirelessClock","id":92638241,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYWMIQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92638241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock","html_url":"https://github.com/TirelessClock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TirelessClock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
