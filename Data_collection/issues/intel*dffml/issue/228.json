Pain Point\r\n\r\nIf you look anywhere in the DFFML codebase you see giant nasty `args` and `config` methods. \r\n\r\n- `args` purpose is to tell `argparse`, and the HTTP API, and other services, how to configure any given class.\r\n- `config` transforms the arguments given via `argparse` or the HTTP API, etc. into and instance of a `NamedTuple` or `dataclass`.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- [model/scratch](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/8577ca57a0bad2c63b860cdd585ae6ca3e4e8fe9/model/scratch/dffml_model_scratch/slr.py#L213-L238)\r\n- [model/tensorflow](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/8577ca57a0bad2c63b860cdd585ae6ca3e4e8fe9/model/tensorflow/dffml_model_tensorflow/dnnc.py#L422-L502)\r\n- [source/mysql](https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/8577ca57a0bad2c63b860cdd585ae6ca3e4e8fe9/source/mysql/dffml_source_mysql/source.py#L147-L208)\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nWe want to do something a long the lines of what we did in `model/scikit`, by using `inspect` to dynamically create the call sequence to `config_set` and `config_get` by inspecting the config class (`CONFIG`) rather than the scikit model:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/8577ca57a0bad2c63b860cdd585ae6ca3e4e8fe9/model/scikit/dffml_model_scikit/scikit_models.py#L139-L163\r\n\r\nThis means that just like many classes set `CONTEXT`, they will also have a property called `CONFIG` which points to their `ClassNamePluginTypeConfig` class.\r\n\r\nThe `metadata` field of `dataclasses.dataclass` might be helpful here to declare the `help`. This task probably involves changing all the `...Config` classes into dataclasses if that is the way we go. Another way would be to have another property, something like `CONFIG_HELP` which specifies help for each.","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
