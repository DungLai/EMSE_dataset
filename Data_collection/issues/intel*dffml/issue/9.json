You can read all about what this means at http://python-gsoc.org/.  This issue, and any others tagged `gsoc` and `project` are not generally available bugs, but related to project ideas for GSoC.\r\n\r\n# Project Idea: Labeled and Versioned Datasets.\r\n\r\n**Project description:** \r\nDFFML's initial release includes sources which abstract the format in which the data is stored from the dataset generation and usage in models.\r\n\r\nAdd information allowing users to have different versions and datasets from the same source.\r\n\r\n**Skills:** Python, git\r\n**Difficulty level:** Intermediate\r\n\r\n**Related Readings/Links:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/dd8007d0c9f8c58c35c94faf148e2b5d6ce4c101/dffml/source/source.py#L16-L45\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/dd8007d0c9f8c58c35c94faf148e2b5d6ce4c101/dffml/repo.py#L90-L116\r\n\r\n**Potential mentors:** @pdxjohnny\r\n\r\n**Getting Started:** `Source.__init__` probably needs another two arguments, `label` and `version`, which should probably have defaults (say, `default` and `v0`). Since the same backend (aka, a csv file or json file) would be used to store all the data, you'll have to change the existing sources we have to understand how to deal with this. For `CSVSource` that might mean adding another column to each repo, for `JSONSource` that might mean instead of one big array, the array of repos is stored like so:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"default\": {\r\n        \"v0\": [\r\n            \"... all the repos ...\"\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What we want to see in your application:** Describe how you intend to solve the problem, and give us some \"stretch goals\", maybe you'll implement a source using `sqlite` too or something. Don't forget to include some time for building appropriate tests.","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
