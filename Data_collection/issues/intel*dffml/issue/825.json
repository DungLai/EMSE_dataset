This is the desired behavior for the git operations, since they run multiple instances of the `git` command in parallel (resulting in the creation of `index.lock` files and the inability to run some git operations in parallel). Whereas with shouldi we aren't doing anything related to Git, we just use the clone operation if the user gives a GIt repo URL.\r\n\r\nWe need to do the reverse of what is done in the locking tutorial and replace the `clone_git_repo`'s output definition `lock` parameter with `False` (rather than the current value of `True`). This would make the scans run in parallel, which is what we want.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- `examples/shouldi/shouldi/use.py`\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/tutorials/dataflows/locking.html","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
