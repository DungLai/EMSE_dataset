We must also ensure that human and machine can interact via a shared language, the universal blueprint.\r\n\r\nAI has the potential to do many great things. However, it also has the potential to to terrible things too. Recently there was an example of scientists who used a model that was good a generating life saving drugs, in reverse, to generate deadly poisons. GPU manufacturers recently implemented anti-crypto mining features. Since the ubiquitous unit of parallel compute is a GPU, this stops people from buying up GPUs for what we as a community at large have deemed undesirable behavior (hogging all the GPUs). There is nothing stopping those people from buying for building their own ASICs to mine crypto. However, the market for that is a subset of the larger GPU market. Cost per unit goes up, multi-use capabilities go down. GPU manufacturers are effectively able to ensure that the greater good is looked after because GPUs are the ubiquitous facilitator of parallel compute. If we prove out an architecture for an AGI that is robust, easy to adopt, and integrates with the existing open source ecosystem, we can bake in this looking after the greater good.\r\n\r\nAs we democratize AI, we must be careful not to democratize AI that will do harm. We must think secure by default in terms of architecture which has facilities for guard rails, baking safety into AI.\r\n\r\nFailure to achieve ubiquitous adoption of an open architecture with meticulously audited safety controls will result in further consolidation of wealth and widening inequality.","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
