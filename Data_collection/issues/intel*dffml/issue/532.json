If any of them are of the image which was re-built, re-run them.\r\n    - Podman looks like it might be simpler to do first with this. We should try that first.\r\n  - Later we can implement alternate re-deployment plugins for different container orchestrators\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
