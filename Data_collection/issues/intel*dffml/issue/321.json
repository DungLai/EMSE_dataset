For example, packages on PyPi are not namespaced. `dffml` is the only `dffml`. On Docker Hub, images *are* namespaced, `intelotc` is the namespace, `intelotc/dffml` is the full image name.

Not only should we do it, we should **enforce** it by modifying the `entrypoint` wrapper function to raise an error if there is no `.` in the string it's passed.
