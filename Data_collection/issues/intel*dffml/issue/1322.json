This project aims to add basic support for commonly used datasets, models, and data pre-processing/cleaning methods for time-series data. \r\n\r\nThis project consists of four phases (Documentation & Testing is required in every phase):\r\n\r\n1. Implementation of Common Datasets:\r\n    - Related Issue: #1319 \r\n    - Add at least 2 datasets.\r\n2. Implementation/Updation of Operations:\r\n    - Related Issue: #1321 \r\n    - Add at least 2 operations.\r\n3. Implementation of  Relevant Models:\r\n    - Related Issue: #1320 \r\n    - Add at least 3 models. \r\n4. Add documentation and examples showing all the three previous phases in action together. You can use Jupyter notebooks, or rST with python scripts and CLI examples, for the same. \r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- Familiarity with Machine Learning \r\n- Experience with various machine learning frameworks (Pytorch & TensorFlow would be a plus)\r\n\r\n## Difficulty\r\n\r\nBeginner/Easy\r\n\r\n## Esstimated Time Required\r\n\r\n350 hours\r\n\r\n## Related Readings\r\n\r\n- Related readings and links have also been added in the related issues mentioned above.\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/data_cleanup/data_cleanup.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/icecream_sales.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/or_covid_data_by_county.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/api/source/dataset/base.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/api/source/dataset/iris.html\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Read the contributing guidelines\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/index.html\r\n- Go through the quickstart\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/quickstart/model.html\r\n- Go through the model tutorials\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/tutorials/models/\r\n- Go through the model plugins\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/plugins/dffml_model.html\r\n- Go through Jupyter Notebook Examples (they also have video walkthroughs available)\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/notebooks/index.html \r\n- You don't need to go through all of them.
