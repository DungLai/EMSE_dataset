Take input of what output data is desired\r\n- Take input of what input data is available\r\n- Output a `dict` describing needed input\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThe output of `Linker.export()[\"operations\"]` is:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"op1\": {\r\n    \"inputs\": {\r\n      \"in1\": \"in1_type\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"outputs\": {\r\n      \"out1\": \"out1_type\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"op2\": {\r\n    \"inputs\": {\r\n      \"in2\": \"out1_type\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"outputs\": {\r\n      \"out2\": \"out2_type\"\r\n    },\r\n  \"op3\": {\r\n    \"inputs\": {\r\n      \"in3\": \"out2_type\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"outputs\": {\r\n      \"out3\": \"out3_type\"\r\n    }\r\n  } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUser says to `dependency backtrack`, I want `out3_type` and have
