Denali](https://www.alaska.org/things-to-do/mckinley-flight-tours) (20,320 feet), rises 1.7 miles above Oregon’s high point, Mount Hood, at 11,239 feet.\r\n> Not only is Mt. Denali the highest mountain in North America, but Alaska has [15 other peaks](https://www.alaska.org/things-to-do/mountains) higher than any in the continental U.S.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to build a dataflow that will allow users to compare any two arbitrary things.\r\n\r\nGet the two things to compare.\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- HTTP Requests\r\n\r\n## Difficulty\r\n\r\nBeginner/Intermediate\r\n\r\n## Related Readings\r\n\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/gsoc/2021/index.html\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Read the contributing guidelines\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/index.html\r\n- Go through the quickstart\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/quickstart/model.html\r\n- Go through the data flow related docs and tutorials\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/tutorials/dataflows/index.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/integration.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/shouldi.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/dataflows.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/mnist.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/flower17/flower17.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/webhook/index.html\r\n- Read about what data flows are and how they work\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/concepts/index.html#dataflows\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/concepts/dataflow.html\r\n- Come up with a basic example where the user will see inputs moving through the\r\n  network.\r\n  - Make it simple and include a few operations.\r\n  - Get the DataFlow running.\r\n- Look at the code in `dffml/df/memory.py` and understand how it relates to the\r\n  docs covering DataFlows conceptually.\r\n- Plan out what all needs to change within `dffml/df/memory.py` and the other\r\n  code and examples that would change as a result.\r\n\r\n## Potential Mentors\r\n\r\n- [John Andersen](https://github.com/pdxjohnny)\r\n- [Saksham Arora](https://github.com/sakshamarora1)\r\n\r\n## Tracking and Discussion\r\n\r\nThis project is related to the following issues.
