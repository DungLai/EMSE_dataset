Create a new file under `dffml_model_library_name`. Each library wrapper does things differently, you should check out how that wrapper is interacting with the underlying library by looking at how the existing models are implemented.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
