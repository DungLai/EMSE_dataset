It does not currently hold a copy of\r\nthe model's config.\r\n\r\nWe'll want to modify the Model's context entry and exit code to have it\r\npack/unpack it's config and its saved state directory from/into the archive at\r\n`location`.\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n\r\n## Difficulty\r\n\r\nBeginner/Intermediate\r\n\r\n## Related Readings\r\n\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/docs/contributing/gsoc/2021/\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Read the contributing guidelines\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/index.html\r\n- Go through the quickstart\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/quickstart/model.html\r\n- Go trough the model tutorials\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/tutorials/models/\r\n- Go through the model plugins\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/plugins/dffml_model.html\r\n- Start programming to understand better what will need to happen. The following\r\n  is a rough guide meant to give you some activities that will help you better\r\n  understand what needs to be done so you can write a more complete proposal.\r\n  - Rename the `directory` property to `location` for all models.\r\n  - On `__aenter__()` of `dffml.model.model.Model`, if `location` has an\r\n    extension, such as zip or tar, extract it to a temporary directory.\r\n  - Write a method, `get_directory()`, which returns the location of the\r\n    temporary directory property on the `Model` class.\r\n  - On `__aexit__()` , pack the model state directory into the `location`, along\r\n    with it's config.\r\n  - Understand where all the code for models are that will potentially need to\r\n    be changed (`dffml/model` and `model/`)\r\n  - Make this work with test cases for the SLR model.\r\n\r\n## Potential Mentors\r\n\r\n- [John Andersen](https://github.com/pdxjohnny)\r\n- [Yash Lamba](https://github.com/yashlamba)\r\n- [Saksham Arora](https://github.com/sakshamarora1)\r\n\r\n## Tracking and Discussion\r\n\r\nThis project is related to the following issues.
