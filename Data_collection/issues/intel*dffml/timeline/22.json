I have two proposed ideas for this. Could you give your suggestions?\r\n\r\nConsidering that the value of ```hidden_units``` might change according to the model and dataset we choose\r\n\r\n## Solution 1\r\n\r\n- Can we have a command line flag ```-ModelParams``` which will take the variable name to be changed and its corresponding value?\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n```\r\ndffml train \\\r\n  -model dnn \\\r\n  -sources csv=iris_training.csv \\\r\n  -classifications 0 1 2 \\\r\n  -features \\\r\n    def:SepalLength:float:1 \\\r\n    def:SepalWidth:float:1 \\\r\n    def:PetalLength:float:1 \\\r\n    def:PetalWidth:float:1 \\\r\n  -num_epochs 3000 \\\r\n  -steps 20000 \\\r\n  -log debug\r\n  -ModelParams \\\r\n     hidden_units=[12,40,15]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis flag could be optional. If no such flag is specified, then it'll choose the default value hardcoded in the model.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantage:**\r\n\r\nThis requires prior knowledge of the model parameters so that the user can modify only the value he/she wants to modify\r\n\r\n## Solution 2\r\n\r\n- Create a ```ModelParams.config``` file that includes all the hard-coded params of the model and its default value. \r\n```\r\ndffml\r\n│    ...\r\n└───model\r\n│   └───tensorflow\r\n│       │   ...\r\n|       └───dffml_model_tensorflow\r\n|       └───model_config\r\n|        |         │  ModelParams.config\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ModelParams.config could have a structure like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"DNN\" : \r\n     {\r\n         \"hidden_units\" : [12, 40, 15],\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe model will be modified to take the values from this config file. If we want to change any of the params, we could just modify this file.       \r\n       \r\nIf you have any more ideas, please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/473616842/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sudharsana-kjl","id":10111093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTExMDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10111093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl","html_url":"https://github.com/sudharsana-kjl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudharsana-kjl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/473686954","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/22#issuecomment-473686954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/22","id":473686954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzY4Njk1NA==","user":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-17T17:28:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-17T17:28:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Awesome!
