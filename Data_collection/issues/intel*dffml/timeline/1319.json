This project aims to add basic support for commonly used datasets, models, and data pre-processing/cleaning methods for time-series data. \r\n\r\nThis project consists of four phases (Documentation & Testing is required in every phase):\r\n\r\n1. Implementation of Common Datasets:\r\n    - Related Issue: #1319 \r\n    - Add at least 2 datasets.\r\n2. Implementation/Updation of Operations:\r\n    - Related Issue: #1321 \r\n    - Add at least 2 operations.\r\n3. Implementation of  Relevant Models:\r\n    - Related Issue: #1320 \r\n    - Add at least 3 models. \r\n4. Add documentation and examples showing all the three previous phases in action together. You can use Jupyter notebooks, or rST with python scripts and CLI examples, for the same. \r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- Familiarity with Machine Learning \r\n- Experience with various machine learning frameworks (Pytorch & TensorFlow would be a plus)\r\n\r\n## Difficulty\r\n\r\nBeginner/Easy\r\n\r\n## Esstimated Time Required\r\n\r\n350 hours\r\n\r\n## Related Readings\r\n\r\n- Related readings and links have also been added in the related issues mentioned above.\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/data_cleanup/data_cleanup.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/icecream_sales.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/or_covid_data_by_county.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/api/source/dataset/base.html\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/api/source/dataset/iris.html\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Read the contributing guidelines\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/index.html\r\n- Go through the quickstart\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/quickstart/model.html\r\n- Go through the model tutorials\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/tutorials/models/\r\n- Go through the model plugins\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/plugins/dffml_model.html\r\n- Go through Jupyter Notebook Examples (they also have video walkthroughs available)\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/notebooks/index.html \r\n- You don't need to go through all of them. Just get a feel for running a few\r\n\r\n## Potential Mentors\r\n\r\n- [John Andersen](https://github.com/pdxjohnny)\r\n- [Saahil

@TirelessClock !! \r\n\r\nThis issue is a part of a GSoC project for this year, so I am not sure if this is up for grabs or how it would work, you may solve this issue partially, but before proceeding please clear this out with @pdxjohnny. \r\n\r\nAs far as the question about \"which datasets are to be used\" is concerned, we definitely want the ones we have listed above, I have linked to their respective sources, also take a look at how datasets work in DFFML, see the link to iris dataset above. \r\n\r\nBut we are open to any other datasets which are commonly used for benchmarking and research purposes. Before implementing one please make sure you're on the same page with the community members so that you don't end up doing work that we'd not be able to merge into the main branch.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes it clear, for any further clarification and queries, join our gitter
