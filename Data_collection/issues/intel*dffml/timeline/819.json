Using several real world popular\r\ndatasets (which have no legal or ethical questions whatsoever, we try to stay\r\nout of trouble here!) we'll want to see what cleanup is required for each of\r\nthem. We'll then make sure that we have pre-made data flows which work for all\r\nof that set of example datasets.\r\n\r\nWe probably want to come up with an easier way to chain data flows together as a\r\npart of this (rather than the merge command). This means taking the cleaned up\r\ndata from one data flow and cleaning that further using another data flow.\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- Experience with feature engineering\r\n\r\n## Difficulty\r\n\r\nBeginner/Intermediate\r\n\r\n## Related Readings\r\n\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/gsoc/2021/index.html\r\n- We have some preprocessing operations for images and NLP already.

For example, city names, animal\r\n    names, etc.\r\n- Prototype what steps you need to take to cleanup the data\r\n  - A step might be, remove outliers, encode categorical data to numeric,\r\n    normalize, etc.\r\n- Implement any cleanup steps for those datasets\r\n- Run the datasets through a few models, with and without cleanup steps applied.\r\n  Record the difference in accuracy. Make sure that you choose datasets which\r\n  result in good accuracy after cleanup. We want to use simple examples.\r\n\r\n## Potential Mentors\r\n\r\n- [John Andersen](https://github.com/pdxjohnny)\r\n- [Saksham Arora](https://github.com/sakshamarora1)\r\n\r\n## Tracking and Discussion\r\n\r\nThis project is related to the following issues.
