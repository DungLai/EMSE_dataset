This is because th epurpose of the CHANGELOG.md file is to tell people what is new *between* releases.\r\n\r\nThis section would be a good place to put #81\r\n\r\nThis section should mention that test coverage is expected to increase or stay the same, so tests will be required for almost all contributions.\r\n\r\nThis sections should mention that documentation is required for any new features. And if you modify the functionality of an existing feature, you're expected to document appropriately.\r\n\r\nThis section should note that a new plugin should only be added when there is a unique set of new dependencies. For example, if we're adding more Tensorflow models, let's just put it in `model/tensorflow`. Only once you have a new set of dependencies, or the purpose is different enough, then should you create a new plugin. If the feature you're adding has no dependencies on third party libraries (nothing you'd install with `pip`) then it should probably go in `dffml/`, rather than a plugin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3601019021,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzYwMTAxOTAyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/events/3601019021","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T21:49:14Z","label":{"name":"good first issue","color":"7057ff"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5233977011,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50NTIzMzk3NzAxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/events/5233977011","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T17:08:07Z","milestone":{"title":"0.5.0 Beta Release"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5233977013,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDUyMzM5NzcwMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/events/5233977013","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T17:08:07Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0 Release"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
