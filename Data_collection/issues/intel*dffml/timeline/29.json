You'll probably want to make a class which subclasses from `TensorflowModelContext` (or maybe even `DNNClassifierModelContext` depending on how many methods you think don't need to be changed).\r\n1. Features we want to train on are passed to the `__init__` method of the `TensorflowModelContext` class (I noticed #216, just so you know that the other method arguments aren't named correctly). We want to train on all features that we know how to make a feature column for using the tensorflow API. The feature columns are created in `TensorflowModelContext.__init__`, the names of the features we care about training on will be in `self.features` the feature volumes are `self.feature_columns`.\r\n  A. You'll notice in the `*_input_fn` methods `self.features` is passed to `repo.features` in order to get a `dict` where the keys are feature names, and the values are the values of that feature.\r\n2. Yes, we're just using hidden units (for now, we could change this later, after you get the first version working, if you want).\r\n3. Yes, `warm_start` should be enabled.
