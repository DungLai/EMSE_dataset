#794 \r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- [x] Merge master after #838 gets merged\r\n- [x] Add tests for all new changes\r\n- [x] Add documentation and example\r\n- [x] Add last layer addition support in `model/pytorch/dffml_model_pytorch/pytorch_pretrained.py`\r\n- [x] Update flower classification example after merging master\r\n- [x] Make changes in `model.pytorch/dffml_model_pytorch/pytorch_base.py` to support non classification/image processing tasks\r\n- [ ] Add entrypoint support for optimizers and learning rate schedulers in pytorch after their annotations are added in the `PyTorch` source code (probably in their next release as they are working on it right now)\r\n\r\nThe last 2 points in the list will be their own separate pull requests\r\n\r\nI also want to try and find if there's a non-confusing way to connect pre-trained model architectures and custom neural nets after all of the above has been done!\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by:
