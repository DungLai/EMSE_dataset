We need to update or remove model/transformers because of this before the 0.4.0 release\r\n- Before release we also need to make sure that we pin all the versions of all the dependencies to known versions that work together.\r\n  - On different OSs (Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.) different versions of dependencies or different packages may be required.\r\n  - As such we need to be able to use Environment Markers\r\n    - Some of these are supported within `setuptools.setup(install_requires=[...])`, some are not. `platform_system` is not. However, it is supported if you use requirements.txt. However, we can't figure out how to make it so that when pip installs one of our packages to have it look in both the `setup.py` `install_requires` AND `requirements.txt`.\r\n    - Therefore, we're exploring moving to PEP-517/518 style packages where most everything is in the `setup.cfg` file, including what used to be in `requirements.txt`\r\n      - This poses another issue where `.` is not allowed in entry point names if they are defined within a `setup.cfg` file, so we're going to have to re-name all the entry point names to replace underscores with
