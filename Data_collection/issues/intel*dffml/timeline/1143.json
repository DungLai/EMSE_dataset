What would be the correct defining the Model type. Shall we keep it as a property of the model that is set manually while defining the model class ?\r\n\r\n* Or it should be a config property which is immutable, and we have a exhaustive set of types to choose from. \r\n\r\n* In both cases I would need  an exhaustive set of types for models. \r\n\r\n* Another way to deal with this could be to return the model object's class name. by making a `classmethod` to return the class name of the object.
