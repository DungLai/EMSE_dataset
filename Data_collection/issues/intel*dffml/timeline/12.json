You can read all about what this means at http://python-gsoc.org/.

For now just make modifications directly to the `FileSource` class. We may have you split out the logic later, but don't worry about another class for now.\r\n\r\n**What we want to see in your application:** Describe how you intend to solve the problem, and give us some \"stretch goals\", maybe implement a remote file source which reads form URLs. Don't forget to include some time for building appropriate tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/473685276","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/12#issuecomment-473685276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/12","id":473685276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzY4NTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-17T17:08:44Z","updated_at":"2019-03-17T17:08:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No worries!
