Denali](https://www.alaska.org/things-to-do/mckinley-flight-tours) (20,320 feet), rises 1.7 miles above Oregon’s high point, Mount Hood, at 11,239 feet.\r\n> Not only is Mt. Denali the highest mountain in North America, but Alaska has [15 other peaks](https://www.alaska.org/things-to-do/mountains) higher than any in the continental U.S.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to build a dataflow that will allow users to compare any two arbitrary things.\r\n\r\nGet the two things to compare.\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- HTTP Requests\r\n\r\n## Difficulty\r\n\r\nBeginner/Intermediate\r\n\r\n## Related Readings\r\n\r\n- https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/gsoc/2021/index.html\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Read the contributing guidelines\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/contributing/index.html\r\n- Go through the quickstart\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/quickstart/model.html\r\n- Go through the data flow related docs and tutorials\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/tutorials/dataflows/index.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/integration.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/shouldi.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/dataflows.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/mnist.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/flower17/flower17.html\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/examples/webhook/index.html\r\n- Read about what data flows are and how they work\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/concepts/index.html#dataflows\r\n  - https://intel.github.io/dffml/master/concepts/dataflow.html\r\n- Come up with a basic example where the user will see inputs moving through the\r\n  network.\r\n  - Make it simple and include a few operations.\r\n  - Get the DataFlow running.\r\n- Look at the code in `dffml/df/memory.py` and understand how it relates to the\r\n  docs covering DataFlows conceptually.\r\n- Plan out what all needs to change within `dffml/df/memory.py` and the other\r\n  code and examples that would change as a result.\r\n\r\n## Potential Mentors\r\n\r\n- [John Andersen](https://github.com/pdxjohnny)\r\n- [Saksham Arora](https://github.com/sakshamarora1)\r\n\r\n## Tracking and Discussion\r\n\r\nThis project is related to the following issues.

Google's made a few big changes:\r\n\r\n1. GSoC is open to anyone over 18, not just students!\r\n2. Projects can now be 175 hours (part-time like last year) or 350hrs (full time like previous years)\r\n\r\n- [ ] update documentation to use the new language of \"GSoC contributor\" instead of \"student\"\r\n- [ ] mark whether your ideas are likely to be 175hr or 350hr commitments.\r\n  - [ ] If we want only full time or only part time folk please make sure that's clear to prospective applicants.\r\n\r\nAs in previous years, PSF is very happy to help projects submit applications directly to Google and they're willing to be the backup plan (suborg) in case Google doesn't select a project as an organization. Ideas page review seems to help a lot, and having some well-described easy ideas seems to increase your changes as a new GSoC org. Being a top-level GSoC org rather than a sub-org \r\nwill give you more control over slot allocation and you'll get to keep the mentor stipends instead of them going into the general PSF grants pool.\r\n\r\nTerri will be sending another email with dates and deadlines and the signup link once she does some updates to the template and test them, but just wanted to make sure we all knew we're getting started and remind us that this year is once again a little bit different than the last!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-11T16:33:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T16:33:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/1325","id":1166623515,"node_id":"I_kwDOCOlgGM5FiUMb","number":1325,"title":"df:
