to publish commit history across projects with email lists or chat notifcations to send on a per repo (or custom function) basis.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is that you're able to figure out what people are working on more quickly and collaborate on problems faster. Breaks down silos caused by pre-pr work. If everyones changes show up as code somewhere. You can quickly understand who is working on what at all times in your org. This allows you to map pre-pr dev branches in docs, infra as code (or gitops), code, etc. anything you have an API for you put it as code. Now all the sudden you have complete visibility into what everyone in your org is working on every time they save their work. This could be extended to provide daemon functionality which watches the filesystem in a repo (fanotify, inotify, `nodemon`, etc.) and sends out diffs for dirty repos (http://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_dirty). You can then map branches to OKRs. You can also map them to ANYTHING, via DID's and personal datastores. We then implement DID and personal datastore support as `df.*Network` objects. Then your code can dynamically just add whatever it wants where ever it wants and a dataflow anywhere else can pick it up (propagates through the blockchain). So you map the branches to the OKRs, issues (requirements, bugs, etc.), etc. Map OKRs and requirements then follow the links in the chain to see who is working on what objectives. Then follow the chain of DIDs to see if anyone is working on the same thing technically. Do this by comparing feature sets of projects as identified by metric collection (similar dependencies, similar API calls, walks like http server, quacks like http server, probably is http server, usage of aiohttp, http.server, common libs for language, check if in depenendnency tree, then move to source analysis). This model is useful for human developers working on projects but will also be useful when we start to get into the cross between automl auto feature engineering used here to come up with modificaitions to dataflows in order to create a distributed system for attempting to build new programs or refactor or patch security vulns (understanding of threat model via architecture of entrie solution as dataflow required to understand context around usage, intent). Need to rememeber to add the ability for any part of a dataflow run to output metrics which can be used to train a model to optimize for any high level goal as defined by the direction to automl that we'd like to move this metric this way. That metric can be as abitrary as \"security\" via model stacking, development time is then equivilant to time consumed on the distributed compute, or developer hours, whoever is faster. There are several important metrics in our final system.\r\n\r\n- speed of thought: running average time to correctly find a valid new dataflow representing a program execution\r\n- speed of trial: running average time to check if a dataflow we thought of can run without triggering any failure conditions\r\n  - Will probably need to think more about failure conditions. Initial set of things that could be checked and used to determine if a faliure occurred. Anything that makes up the system context (system state, ping: https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/1279#issuecomment-994139897)\r\n    - All metrics which can be reported during the running of a flow\r\n    - All outputs\r\n    - All inputs\r\n    - Config\r\n    - Output of a model trained on all of the above data\r\n    - Generic dataflow to determine failure of other dataflow.\r\n      - Maybe we should extend this to dataflows themselves, allow a flow similar to seed to set a dataflow which runs as a subflow (so within the same input network context)\r\n- speed of error: running average number of failed runs as a percentage of total runs. Lower numbers here mean we are thinking in the right direction.\r\n- usefulness of thoughts: Are our thoughts generating dataflows which are improving our metrics in the right directions to meet our overall goal, our example from earlier was increase \"security\".\r\n  - Need to find a way to measure how much closer we are getting to our end goal, which appropriately reflects when a conceptual leap has been made (we made a lot of progress towards our goal, last set of values we were trying to move was at X now were at 10X, or X^10, is logarithmic scale important here?)\r\n- chaos: diversity of authorship applied to clustering model run on all thoughts (dataflows) where each dataflow maps to line changed and the cluster classification is the author.\r\n\r\nProbably want to make the collection of these metrics done by flows. Look into doing this by just running a dataflow at any point within the execution of the dataflow to hit output stage operations, theres a method for this. We can then just trigger the metric collection flow periodically, maybe via running in a subflow with same contexts triggered by the running of an operation within the parent flow, or just triggered by caller whenever if running with #919 `async for` style.\r\n\r\n- Org repo modified -> email org members working on those projects","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/1066814280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/1066971630","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/1315#issuecomment-1066971630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1315","id":1066971630,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCOlgGM4_mLHu","user":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T15:42:18Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T16:04:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Question around what to do client side when you receive a change notification from a peer.\r\n\r\n- If it's known working do you change your local copy of the flow?\r\n- Do you have a lists which say accept these changes from these peers for these operations or flows automatically?\r\n\r\nModes:\r\n- Developing\r\n  - Use dev pull model for custom dynamic BKD, always run with the latest working code as viewed across all peers\r\n- Debugging\r\n  - Ensure running on the upstream BKD, stash dev pull model changes\r\n\r\n## Example: Two devs: CR0/4\r\n\r\nFor example, devs Alice and Bob are working on a dataflow which has a SUT being used to run CR0/4 patchest validation (KSPP Issue 19).\r\n\r\nThey both have their own SUT which they are using actively for development. Alice is working in kexec-tools and Bob is working in QEMU. Recall that there were multiple failure conditions when this patch was first introduced which could be pursued in parallel with enough developers.\r\n\r\nStart with the desired end state of the the system. The state the system (defined as end state after executing flow) would be given by a pass result from the test cases: https://github.com/pdxjohnny/protecting_cr4_host_setup/blob/master/test.sh\r\n\r\n- Hibernation / Suspend to RAM\r\n- kexec\r\n- SMM\r\n- L2\r\n\r\nIf either Alice or Bob make a change which results in one of those test cases passing, it is promoted to the best known data flow (BKD). The data flow defining the test run is of course also stored upstream, which is the BKD. However, what's new about this pull model approach is that Alice and Bob can now define what their BKD should be based on, dynamically. Bob can say if Alice finds any changes that advance the upstream flow, auto apply them to my local copy. To advance the BKD one must provide essentially a more useful thought than the current most useful thought. Where a thought here is a dataflow, and in the way that we are pulling in from other devs it's likely an overlay, or a diff between dataflows.\r\n\r\nLet's go back in time before any of the work had been done.
