You can read all about what this means at http://python-gsoc.org/.  This issue, and any others tagged `gsoc` and `project` are not general bugs, but project ideas which one could choose to write a proposal for. Issue tagged as `gsoc` and `project` can also be used as an example for what the scope of an idea for a project proposal might look like.\r\n\r\n# Project Idea: shouldi Meta Static Analysis Tool\r\n\r\n**Project description:**\r\nWe have a tool called shouldi. The goal here is to make shouldi into a better meta static analysis tool that can handle multiple languages (right now it just analyses Python). The end result will be  a generic tool that we can point at any codebase which gives us a report back on what static analysis tools for the language of that codebase think about it.\r\n\r\n**Skills:** Python, git\r\n**Difficulty level:** Intermediate\r\n\r\n**Related Readings/Links:**\r\n\r\n- [How shouldi was written and works](https://intel.github.io/dffml/tutorials/operations.html)\r\n- [Tracking steps to make shouldi](https://github.com/intel/dffml/projects/3)\r\n\r\n**Potential mentors:** @pdxjohnny, @yashlamba\r\n\r\n**Getting Started:**\r\nYou'll want to go through the shouldi tutorial and then start writing operations that run static analysis tools for various languages. Then you'll want to do #364. Check the project board for more issues.\r\n\r\n**What we want to see in your application:**\r\nDescribe how you intend to solve the problem, and give us some \"stretch goals\", maybe \r\nyou'd want to attempt to get this working with C projects. Don't forget to include some time for building appropriate tests. Identify what static analysers you'll use, and explain how you'll aggregate and present their output in a useful format. The goal is to inform the user as to if there are potential security risks to the software they want to use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/365/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/580263075","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/364#issuecomment-580263075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/364","id":580263075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDI2MzA3NQ==","user":{"login":"aghinsa","id":39557075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTU3MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39557075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa","html_url":"https://github.com/aghinsa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aghinsa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-30T13:52:55Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T17:48:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\ni
