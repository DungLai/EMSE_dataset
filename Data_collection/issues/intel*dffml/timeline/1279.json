Manifest Schema\r\n\r\nManifests allow us to focus less on code and more on data.\r\nBy focusing on the data going into and out of systems. We can achieve standard\r\ndocumentation of processes via a standard interface (manifests).\r\n\r\nOur manifests can be thought of as ways to provide a config class with it's\r\nparameters or ways to provide an operation with it's inputs.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n- JSON Schema\r\n\r\n  - https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step\r\n\r\n  - https://schema.org/\r\n\r\n  - https://www.schemastore.org/json/\r\n\r\n- Manifest Shim (parser and validator for manifests)\r\n\r\n  - https://github.com/intel/dffml/pull/1273\r\n\r\n## Validating\r\n\r\nInstall jsonschema, and pyyaml python modules\r\n\r\n- https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\r\n- https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation\r\n\r\n```console\r\npip install pyyaml jsonschema\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how you convert from yaml to json\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python -c \"import sys, pathlib, json, yaml; pathlib.Path(sys.argv[-1]).write_text(json.dumps(yaml.safe_load(pathlib.Path(sys.argv[-2]).read_text()), indent=4) + '\\n')\" manifest.yaml manifest.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample below validates, checking status code we see exit code 0 which means\r\nsuccess, the document conforms to the schema.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ jsonschema --instance manifest.json manifest-format-name.0.0.2.schema.json\r\n$ echo $?\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Writing\r\n\r\nSuggested process (in flux)\r\n\r\n- Make sure you can run the jsonschema validator\r\n\r\n  - TODO Validation micro service\r\n\r\n- Look at existing problem space\r\n\r\n  - What data is needed? This likely will becomes the inputs of a dataflow,\r\n    or an operation, or config.\r\n\r\n  - Write first draft of what a valid manifest would be\r\n\r\n- Write schema based off initial manifest\r\n\r\n  - Do not include fields for future use. Only include what you currently intend\r\n    to use for each version\r\n\r\n    - Instead, create a new format name and new schema. If we stick to the rule\r\n      of if you have the data you have to act on it, there is never any if A then\r\n      B situations. If you want a different outcome, you create different manifest.\r\n      This helps keep architectures loosely coupled\r\n      https://medium.com/@marciosete/loosely-coupled-architecture-6a2b06082316\r\n\r\n    - We also decided that we could potentially combine manifests. This allows for\r\n      you to use the data you wanted, but just keep it sperate and make the decision\r\n      to combine the equivalent of adding variables purely as conditional on use of data.\r\n      This way if the data is present, it is always used!\r\n\r\n    - By ensuring that data present is always used, we can begin to map manifests to\r\n      dataflows, in this way, we can check the validity of a dataflow simply by ensuring\r\n      all manifest data is used as an input or config.\r\n\r\n      - As such, a passing validity check ensures we have a complete description of a\r\n        problem. We know all the inputs and system constraints (manifests), and we are\r\n        sure that they will be taken into account on execution (dataflow run).\r\n\r\n  - Each field with a `type` MUST have a `description`\r\n\r\n- Write ADR describing context around creation and usage of manifest\r\n\r\n  - The ADR should describe how the author intends the manifest to be used\r\n\r\n  - Treat the ADR + manifest like a contract. If something\r\n    accepts the manifest (valid format and version, see shim)\r\n    it is obligated to fulfil the intent of the ADR. The consumer\r\n    MUST return an error response when given a manifest if it\r\n    cannot use each piece of data in the manifest as directed by\r\n    the ADR and descriptions of fields within the manifest schema.\r\n\r\n  - The `Intent` section of the ADR should describe how you want manifest\r\n    consumers to use each field.\r\n\r\n## ADR Template\r\n\r\n```rst\r\nmy-format-name\r\n##############\r\n\r\nVersion: 0.0.1\r\nDate: 2022-01-22\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n******\r\n\r\nProposed|Evolving|Final\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n***********\r\n\r\nADR for a declaration of assets (manifest) involved in the process\r\nof greeting an entity.\r\n\r\nContext\r\n*******\r\n\r\n- We need a way to describe the data involved in a greeting\r\n\r\nIntent\r\n******\r\n\r\n- Ensure valid communication path to ``entity``\r\n\r\n- Send ``entity`` message containing ``greeting``\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/1013468346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/1018174423","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/1279#issuecomment-1018174423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1279","id":1018174423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCOlgGM48sBvX","user":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T04:39:53Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T04:40:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"State transition, issue filing, estimating time to close issue, all have to do with having the complete mapping of inputs to problem (data flow).

This work also helps our project (dffml) as we scale out to understand how we can work more effectively across our plugins and the main package. This work also relates to coming up with ways to help the builtree organization scale and be more effective.\r\n\r\nWe talked about the existing InnerSource demos and how the goal of InnerSource as is it to enable more frequent changes of higher quality with increased reuse and contribution happening across an organization (such as builtree). We talked about how the one could use the [CII best practices badging program](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge) as metrics, [example](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1/0#analysis).\r\n\r\nMetrics can also be used to help projects get visibility so that others are aware of their feature sets when they need to reuse a project or aspects of a project. Feature set collection is also useful for analysis of what project efforts need to be joined/consolidated due to similar feature sets (for example the same set of functions in two python projects `utils.py`).\r\n\r\n Metrics can also be about people, this person is at skill level 0-5 for JavaScript, our model could tell us that investing a mentors time in helping them learn JavaScript would accelerate development across projects faster than that mentor talking another issue. (Increase in overall production output, civilization terminology)\r\n\r\nbuiltree has several projects which have potential cross project collaboration (we talked about dffml and the secret vault for the generic CI/CD work). Identification of feature sets helps determine where more opportunities for cross project collaboration exist. it also helps when contributors want to propose a new project, to identify if a similar project already exists. This ties into the [inventory](https://github.com/intel/dffml/pull/1207#discussion_r711843933).\r\n\r\nWe talked about how investing in driving up metrics now (before GSoC season) will pay off big in terms of less manual review needing to be done and making contributors more autonomous and enabled to do great work (quality docs, tests, etc.).\r\n\r\nWe should consider creating some kind of org level health metrics. So that we can see the reuse and contribution happening from maintainers and contributors across projects (cross pollination, metric which describes health of set of projects, potentially the set of projects is the whole org).\r\n\r\nWe also talked about implementing InnerSource for an open source org could help senior folks in an org prioritize what they should work on when they have a role to help all the projects across the org when needed. Having this traceability and data on potential impact of work (this ties in with the estimating time to complete issue stuff from #1279) allows org admins / maintainers to make data driven decisions about what to work on. They will have a model to see that closing issue X increases throughput or quality, or both across all projects in the org by Y amount (time to close other issues shrinks) as estimated by the model / data flow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe presentation we did at bsides pdx 2019 shows how we developed methodology for an event driven CI/CD pipeline which yielded insights into open source project maintenance and security posture. The work in this issue is a potential avenue to another presentation. One where we show how we continued work on our CI/CD + ML project to gather further insights on open source projects, including our own. Then though application on InnerSource principles within our orgs, we use those insights to build more effective organizations.\r\n\r\n- What you're using\r\n  - SBOM and Allowlist tool / presentation\r\n- How you're using it\r\n  - Data flow as standard architecture\r\n- Should you be using it or something else\r\n  - InnerSource","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-23T01:41:05Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T01:41:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1207","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1207/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1207/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1207/events","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/pull/1207","id":978618998,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzE5MTc4ODU0","number":1207,"title":"docs: arch: Inventory","user":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2021-08-25T01:39:06Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T16:56:14Z","closed_at":"2022-03-12T22:22:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"repository":{"id":149512216,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDk1MTIyMTY=","name":"dffml","full_name":"intel/dffml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"intel","id":17888862,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE3ODg4ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17888862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel","html_url":"https://github.com/intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intel/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml","description":"The easiest way to use Machine Learning.

This is difficult to manage with the changes you have already made, using a dataflow makes this easy, as we focus on how the pieces of data should connect, rather than implementations of their connections.\r\n\r\nThis declarative approach is important because the source of inputs change depending on your environment.

Each building has an architecture and purpose within the architecture of your overall city. Imagine that there are at certain guiding overall strategies which the entities within the city understand must be taken into account to perform any actions they're directed to do. For example, one strategic goal or piece of a strategic plan might be that the city should always collect garbage and there should never be a day where garbage is not collected from more than 75% of the residents. The garbage crews as agents need to know that their course of action in terms of actions they should take or next steps sent by the city should have been vetted by the strategic plan which involves the assurance of residents garbage being picked up at the expected percentage. Entities also make decisions based on data used to train their models in an active learning situation. Data used to train agent action / strategic plans should come only from flows validated by a set of strategic plans, or strategic plans with certain credentials (verified to ensure kill no humans is applicable for this subset of data). This will allow us to add controls on training models, to ensure that their data does not come from sources which would cause malicious behavior, or behavior unaligned with other any active strategic plans. We must also be able to add new strategic plans on the fly and modify the top level strategic decision maker. This example maps too the provenance information we will be collecting about the plans given to agents or inputs given to opimps. This provenance information must include in attestation or valid claim that that certain sets of strategic plans were taken into consideration by the top level strategic decision maker when the orders come down to that agent or opimp.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOptimize for efficiency is post captializm society \r\nMap people and what makes them happy and feel good health wise, things they jive with conceptually. This is like how to find the optimal agent to run the job to execute any active strategic plans (model optimization targets), because certain agents or opimps have attributes like attestation abilities which is why we might pick them if one of our active strategic plans is to optimize for hardening for threats within a treat model (effectively alternate mitigations, which show relationship between intent to secure assets or maintain security properties of the system)\r\nUsing something is a metric that might be accounted for by the strategic optimization models. One hour, one cycle, one instance\r\nHow to you know what the modifications to the strategy (system context) should be? Predict the outputs plus structured logged metrics based on models of historical data. Run optimization collector flows across all the predicted flow + system context purmutations. Use automl feature engineering to generate new possibilities for system context (alternative input values). Create alternate flows using threat model alternative mitigation implementor which understands optimizing for strategic security goals with regards to assest protection by understanding intent via intuitive shared human machine language : dataflows\r\nThe models we build on top of the data from the optimization collector flows are the strategic plans. These models effectively are encoder/decoder language translation models with high accuracy as assessed by an arbitrary accuracy scorer (we may need a way to assess the aggregate accuracy as the percentage of good thoughts). Their individual scores tell us within their scorers description of meaning (human scorer in case of allowlist forms). For example with optimizing for security one could output (or raise exception) a value that says this is an absolute veto power moment from that strategy, signifying we should not consider the result of the prediction acute (similar to allowlist set to conditional if crypto detected). There is a top level strategic model which makes the final decisions as to what system contexts will be explored (what thoughts are acted on and what are thought through further)\r\nIts almost like we tie the agents in and we are thinking many thoguhts (dataflows) and some thoughts we want to act on and some we want to continue to think about to see how they play out with more throetical paths and maybe even variations on startegic plans used to create those system input contexts.

We'll be successful when Alice successfully maintains a DFFML plugin as the only maintainer for a year. Debugging issues, writing fixes, reviewing code, accepting pull requests, refactoring the code base post PR merge, dealing with vulnerabilities, cutting releases, maintaining release branches, and completing development work in alignment with the plugin's universal blueprint. She will modify, submit pull requests to, and track upstreaming of patches to her dependencies to achieve the cleanest architecture possible. We'll interact with her as we would any other remote developer.\r\n\r\nWe'll need to build the foundations of Alice's thought processes. Throughout this series, we'll rely heavily on a mental model based on how humans think and problem solve. By the end of this series we'll have ensured Alice has all the primitive operations she requires to carry out the scientific process.\r\n\r\n### Terminology\r\n\r\n- Universal Blueprint\r\n  - Standard architecture we use to describe anything. Provides the ability to use / reference domain specific architectures as needed to define architecture of whole.\r\n- Think\r\n  - Come up with new data flows and system context input\r\n- Thoughts\r\n  - Data Flows and system context input pairs (these two plus orchestration config we get the whole system context)\r\n\r\n### Expectations\r\n\r\nAlice is going to be held to very high standards. We should expect this list to grow for a long time (years). This list of expectations may at times contain fragments which need to be worked out more and are only fragment so the ideas don't get forgotten. \r\n\r\n- Alice will maintain a system which allows her to respond to asynchronous messages\r\n  - Likely a datastore with the ability to listen for changes\r\n  - Changes would be additions of messages from different sources (email, chat, etc.)\r\n- Alice should be able to accept a meeting, join it, and talk to you\r\n  - You should be able to have a conversation about a universal blueprint and she should be able to go act on it.\r\n\r\n### Alice's Understanding of Software Engineering\r\n\r\nWe'll teach Alice what she needs to know about software engineering though our InnerSource series. She'll follow the best practices outlined there. She'll understand a codebase's health in part using InnerSource metric collectors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/1103489918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
