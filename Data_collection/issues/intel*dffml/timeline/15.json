I wanted to ask whether we will be writing JSON objects or something pre-defined, or shall I take random objects just to implement it and writing tests for now? \r\n\r\nFor using dictionaries, we still need to use json for encoding and decoding to bytes (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39450065/python-3-read-write-compressed-json-objects-from-to-gzip-file)\r\n\r\nI have referred mainly to \r\nhttps://www.journaldev.com/19827/python-gzip-compress-decompress#python-gzip-module\r\nand\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html\r\n\r\nFor the basics, I have implemented the following. Is this what that is needed for now? I'll open a WIP: PR if this is what is needed:\r\n\r\nFor reading:\r\n```\r\n    async def load_fd(self, fd):\r\n        with gzip.GzipFile(fd, 'rb') as f:\r\n            repos = f.read()            \r\n        #LOGGER.debug('%r loaded %d records', self, len(self.mem))\r\n        f.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Writing:\r\n```\r\n    async def dump_fd(self, fd):\r\n        data = b'data'\r\n        with gzip.GzipFile(fd, 'wb') as f:\r\n            f.write(data)\r\n        f.close()\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/475212052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yashlamba","id":44164398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTY0Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44164398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba","html_url":"https://github.com/yashlamba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashlamba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/comments/475374068","html_url":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/15#issuecomment-475374068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/15","id":475374068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTM3NDA2OA==","user":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T19:38:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T19:38:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/intel/dffml/blob/dd8007d0c9f8c58c35c94faf148e2b5d6ce4c101/dffml/source/file.py#L43-L44\r\n\r\nwould be\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif self.filename[::-1].startswith(('.gz')[::-1]):\r\n    #
