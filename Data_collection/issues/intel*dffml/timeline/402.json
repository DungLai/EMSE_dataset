I'd say try making a source that doesn't do anything (`return` right away for each of the required methods), figure out how to get the test_dbsource.py set up.

Looks like there's a SQLDatabaseContext but no corresponding SQLBaseDatabase. Maybe we would add something else for Mongo or other NoSQL options in the future? I initially thought a non-relational database wouldn't be well suited for ML but [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/training-machine-learning-models-with-mongodb) makes a case for it (I think the gist is that they used a generator function to get the Mongo data into a ML-ready matrix).\"\r\n>\r\n> [Original
