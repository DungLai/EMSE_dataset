All commits starting with `test` shouldn't contain any `test_`  in the rest of the parts \r\n  - Implement a new mutation which is only triggered when the commit starts with `test`\r\n- [x] 2. Substitutions are required for certain cases , where a word should translate to a path\r\n  - Add a substitution step which would replace such cases with their respective actual paths. \r\n- [ ] 3.  Checking for function/class names in files/folders\r\n  - Add a mutation which checks for a valid , file/directory path by recursively removing segments from the end of it until it finds a valid file/directory path , and then it searches for the removed segments in those files. \r\n  - for ex: In `util: net: cached_download(): Changed logging` , the mutation should remove the `cached_download()` part and check for `util/net` as a path with extensions mutation, and by this it will resolve to `dffml/util/net.py`, and then we've to search in that file for the removed part , i.e. `cached_download()` in this file, similarly if it resolved to a directory then we'd need to search all the files in that directory. \r\n  - This might sound complicated but it can be implemented easily as a `body_mutation` , we'd need this category for other things as well curretly we have only `prefix_mutations` and `suffix_mutations` only , this body mutation should only be applied if all the removed parts are found in their respective file/directory paths. \r\n- [ ] 4. Capitalization should be done for certain parts of the path\r\n  - Implement a body mutation to handle capitalisation of last and second last parts of the path. \r\n- [ ] 5. Special keywords should be ignored \r\n  - A simple body mutation to filter these words can be implemented.\r\n- [ ] 6. Investigate why [this](https://github.com/intel/dffml/pull/1174/checks?check_run_id=3308979214) is failing and fix it, related to 1. above\r\n- [ ] 7. Add support for \"Merge branch `x` into `y`\" type of commits.\r\n- [ ] 8. Add support for Reverted \" < some valid commit > \" type of commits.\r\n- [ ] 9. Add rule that all that checks whether the first letter of every section of the commit is capitalised \r\n- [ ] 10. Fix [the bug](https://github.com/intel/dffml/issues/1136#issuecomment-922460785) introduced while implementing 1. above","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/1136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5075465204,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTA3NTQ2NTIwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/events/5075465204","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-27T16:37:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5075465303,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUwNzU0NjUzMDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/events/5075465303","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b412806c81eeb1e1a09ce4dd2d3b253e9921d779","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/commits/b412806c81eeb1e1a09ce4dd2d3b253e9921d779","created_at":"2021-07-27T16:37:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6226780376,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCOlgGM4xjXR-zwAAAAFzJSDY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/events/6226780376","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4b50da8db372c3a739e585bb20d228c680d58fc7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pdxjohnny/dffml/commits/4b50da8db372c3a739e585bb20d228c680d58fc7","created_at":"2022-03-11T18:36:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6230193779,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCOlgGM4xjXR-zwAAAAFzWTZz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intel/dffml/issues/events/6230193779","actor":{"login":"pdxjohnny","id":5950433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny","html_url":"https://github.com/pdxjohnny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjohnny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdxjo
