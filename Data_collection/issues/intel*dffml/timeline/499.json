Since you're already working on this issue, It's my understanding that you just have to remove the file and its reference from setup.py for fixing it. Oh and also make sure to find any references to the file you're removing so nothing breaks. #500 suggests moving misc.py to dffml/model/slr.py, it's not the same file.\r\nI can always PR it with #500 if you'd prefer
