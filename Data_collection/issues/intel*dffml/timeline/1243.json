A simple notification containing an ad is displayed at a frequency that you can set.   \r\n\r\n* The point I am trying to make is if community members can start using brave and enable brave rewards, at the end of the month auto contribute the crypto amount to a creator account for DFFML, we can either withdraw that amount into EUR, GBP or USD and use that to pay for infrastructure. \r\n\r\n* Even if we don't withdraw into a bank and directly use some provider like [BitLaunch](https://bitlaunch.io/) or  [birhost](https://bithost.io/) (as shared by @r00tkillah on twitter) I think we'd be good to go. \r\n\r\n* The only issue here might be with Uphold, because I have had issues with it and that is the wallet you need to use when using brave rewards, but I guess withdrawing is more of an issue here in India and might not be in other countries.

a fan of the brave stuff but have heard creators had issues transferring tokens. Have you heard of any issues with that? Might have been from a while ago and fixed now.  I'm a huge proponent of this approach.\r\n\r\n> Even if we don't withdraw into a bank and *directly use some provider like BitLaunch or birhost* (as shared by @r00tkillah on twitter) I think we'd be good to go.\r\n\r\nOne of those hosting providers is probably the way to go right now. We should probably avoid connecting real credit cards, etc. to any of the infra since that would be tied to a single person. Long term our options include setting up a 501c3 non-profit, or something like that.  https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations/life-cycle-of-a-private-foundation-starting-outm https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations . Or maybe joining something like the Linux Foundation.\r\n\r\nFor those who want to allow their personal infrastructure to be accessible (for example a home server). We will be able to allow them to expose functionality easily to the community should they wish (via the orchestrator and other stuff being worked on with dataflows). I'm going to be writing a lot of tutorials on all that soon.\r\n\r\nIt's important that we keep funding in mind long term with the project. Google graciously provides funds for GSoC. One of our goals could be to figure out how we could fund a non-GSoC intern, in the event we don't get as many GSoC slots as we'd hoped. (Or maybe someone's work during the winter).\r\n\r\nEventually it would be great if we could flush out how some kind of bounty system could work (https://discuss.python.org/t/how-do-we-want-to-manage-additions-removals-to-the-stdlib/10681/40) for contributors tackling

But, it is a proven service and is cheaper I think compared to linode, digital ocean and vultr (The ones supported by bithost.io).\r\n\r\nAlso, there are free limited vps services as well, usually for up to a year and of course with limited resources, eg. [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) \r\n\r\nI'm actually using it to run a node for a project.
