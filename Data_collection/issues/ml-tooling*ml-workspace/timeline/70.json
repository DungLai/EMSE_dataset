@huapox, thanks a lot for the answer! I just tested it and the entry in `/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes` is also the reason for the Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 images! If you comment the line out as you suggested and install the package again (e.g. `dpkg -i thunar-data_1.6.15-0ubuntu1.18.04.1_all.deb` as described in the comment above), the translations are copied correctly! I think we are going to comment out that line in future versions of the workspace image by default then or at least add it to the FAQ section in the Readme","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/842072249/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4752649471,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc1MjY0OTQ3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/4752649471","actor":{"login":"huapox","id":6138651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzg2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6138651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox","html_url":"https://github.com/huapox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-17T07:15:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4752649477,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NTI2NDk0Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/4752649477","actor":{"login":"huapox","id":6138651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzg2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6138651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox","html_url":"https://github.com/huapox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huapox/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-17T07:15:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
