We plan to become more active again and update the repositories and go through the issues very soon! Just Friday, we released a cool repository in the context of our work - and leveraging the ml-workspace repository - which you can find [here](https://github.com/sap/machine-learning-lab/).\r\n\r\n@deanp70 Would you mind to create a PR with your changes so we can have a look and probably be able to merge them?\r\nEdit: I have just seen that there is a PR already open with regards to package updates.

Hey @Emporea and @deanp70 , thanks for the question and great to hear about your efforts to update the packages!\r\n> Due to a variety of reasons like working on Corona projects and other work-related things, we were unfortunately not able to be very active here. We plan to become more active again and update the repositories and go through the issues very soon! Just Friday, we released a cool repository in the context of our work - and leveraging the ml-workspace repository - which you can find [here](https://github.com/sap/machine-learning-lab/).\r\n> \r\n> @deanp70 Would you mind to create a PR with your changes so we can have a look and probably be able to merge them?\r\n> Edit: I have just seen that there is a PR already open with regards to package updates. Maybe there is an overlap.\r\n\r\nIndeed I mainly merged that commit and made sure everything still works. Great to hear you will look at the PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/686358046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"deanp70","id":18662887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjYyODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18662887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70","html_url":"https://github.com/deanp70","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3723697696,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzcyMzY5NzY5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3723697696","actor":{"login":"deanp70","id":18662887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjYyODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18662887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70","html_url":"https://github.com/deanp70","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-03T09:06:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3723697699,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MjM2OTc2OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3723697699","actor":{"login":"deanp70","id":18662887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjYyODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18662887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70","html_url":"https://github.com/deanp70","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deanp70/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-03T09:06:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3723697704,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzcyMzY5NzcwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3723697704","actor":{"login":"Emporea","id":21969523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTY5NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21969523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea","html_url":"https://github.com/Emporea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emporea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-03T09:06:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3723697707,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MjM2OTc3MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3723697707","actor":{"login":"Emporea","id":21969523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTY5NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.co
