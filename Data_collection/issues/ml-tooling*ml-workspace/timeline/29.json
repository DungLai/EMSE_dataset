In the normal usage, the `environment.yml` is currently not installed automatically (we might consider that in the future). When you start the workspace, it is somewhat like a virtual machine running on you computer with its own OS, installed libraries and tools. \r\n\r\nThe beste way to install additional dependencies is by just using the terminal within the workspace (find out more in the [extensibility section](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace#extensibility)). So, you can just create a new conda environment from your environment.yml as explained [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). VS-code should automatically discover this new environment. If you like to use Jupyter, just use `ipykernel` to install a kernel in the given environemnt as explained [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments). \r\n\r\nHowever, since the base conda environment of the workspace already comes preinstalled with many of the most commonly used libraries, you might not even have to install your `environment.yml` (depending on the complexity of your dependencies). I mostly manage my project dependencies within a `requirements.txt` which I install via pip within the base conda environment of the workspace.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/583689099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LukasMasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/LukasMasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3019605659,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAxOTYwNTY1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3019605659","actor":{"login":"tbrassel","id":37461300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDYxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37461300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrassel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-08T01:59:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3019605661,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMTk2MDU2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3019605661","actor":{"login":"tbrassel","id":37461300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDYxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37461300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrassel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-08T01:59:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3028196457,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzAyODE5NjQ1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3028196457","actor":{"login":"tbrassel","id":37461300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDYxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37461300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrassel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-11T20:59:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
