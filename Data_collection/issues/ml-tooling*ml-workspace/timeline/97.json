I think publishing this container doesn't need to initially have all pre-installed libraries which could be solved via manual installation via Jupyterhub/Jupyter Notebook in general which would keep things easier for maintaining as every day support for ARM libraries comes with workarounds and support from different projects. \r\n\r\nI think for adding ARM support we can go the minimal way. Making sure that tools are working (maybe replace unsupported or try later to have ARM build for them) and the more fundamental libraries having support like `numpy` and `matplotlib` already on arm64. But in general I agree with you that \"normal\" version does not work on ARM, so things are not a problem of cross build or just build on arm machine and everything will work out of the box. \r\n\r\nI would like to work on that but honestly don't know the scope of what we could achieve and if you would mind having different (potentially fewer features) ARM version.
