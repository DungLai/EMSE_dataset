We currently do not have any plans to add a dedicated Julia flavor image. However, we have the concept of \"on-click\" [installer scripts](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/tree/develop/resources/tools). A julia/julia kernel installer script would be a fantastic addition for the workspace. Currently, we do not have the resources to add this on ourselves, but if you want to try to contribute such a script you can take a look at [this installer script](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/blob/develop/resources/tools/r-runtime.sh) for the r-interpreter/kernel as inspiration. Keep in mind that within the workspace you have full freedom to install anything that runs on ubuntu, e.g. you can install the julia interpreter via: `apt-get install julia`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/541029580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LukasMasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/LukasMasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/541782750","html_url":"https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/7#issuecomment-541782750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/7","id":541782750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTc4Mjc1MA==","user":{"login":"sterlinm","id":1461273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjEyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1461273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm","html_url":"https://github.com/sterlinm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlinm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-14T16:33:21Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T16:33:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Okay thanks!
