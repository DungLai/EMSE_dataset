However, since JupyterHub is not able to perform a universal routing (proxying) of any kind of HTTP/SSH request, a lot of the additional functionality of the ML Workspace such as SSH access or accessing some tools (VS Code, VNC, Ungit, ...) will not work. This is one reason why we created ML Hub on top of JupyterHub to add these universal routing capabilities.\r\n\r\nAs with root permission, we have just added a small section about this topic to our [FAQ](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace#faq). So, currently, it is not supported, but we are planning to add this capability. Since we do not see it as supercritical from a security perspective (as explained in the FAQ), this might take some time until we can get this implemented. We are planning a major refactoring (updating to Python 3.7, Ubuntu 18, adding CI tests...) until end of this year, and adding a non-root user might be one additional goal for this task.

The primary benefit of this is that in a setting where each user can log in and spin up their own `ml-workspace`, they now have a way to tie into their home directory on the host file-system. This allows for a single-location, transportable configuration across multiple workspaces, in the cases where a workspace is used as a \"project sandbox\" (if you will).\r\n\r\n**Problem and motivation:**\r\n- _Why is this change important to you?_ I've been using `ml-hub` for a bit and it's great, but I (and other users on my system) find that we're setting up our shell configurations (and cloning projects) quite a bit. \r\n- _What is the problem this feature would solve?_ \r\n   1. Transporting user configurations and credentials (e.g. ECDSA keys) between workspaces.\r\n   1. Allow `ml-hub` to work from local datasets (e.g. someone working on YouTube-8M – it's difficult to redownload the entire dataset in a reasonable timeframe.)\r\n   1. Users with a file-sync service running on the host can have their changes reflected from `ml-hub`.\r\n   1. Work within `ml-workspaces` is more transparently accessible.\r\n- _How would you use it?_ Personally, all the problems this solves are exactly what I'm looking for. While it's challenging to do things like mount datasets directly, I could solve that with some hard-linking. Though this brings to mind another possible feature for admins of `ml-hub` – _specify dataset repositories_.\r\n- _How can it benefit other users?_ I'm not too sure how it would benefit other users, **explicitly**, but I have a general feeling that once `ml-hub` supports local user mappings, and if there's a way to port this to `singularity`, HPCs could be interested in using this along with some smaller teams of ML researchers/developers.\r\n\r\n**Is this something you're interested in working on?**\r\nYea!

I don't believe it's a huge security risk to mount `/etc/passwd:ro` within the container.\r\n\r\nProposing this approach, instead, mostly because a new user within the container will always have PID/GID = 1000, unless otherwise specified, and Docker will perform that mapping within the container.

Attempt a migration from the current `Dockerfile` to  an [`s6-overlay`][s6]. This is mostly to allow for insertion of tasks to run on startup in a slightly cleaner and more understandable way.\r\n1. Add a non-root (e.g. `abc`) who takes on the `$PUID:$PGID` passed into the container via environment variables. (This is straight out of the inner workings of `linuxserver` containers.)\r\n\r\nI haven't picked apart the container, but I don't believe many (if any) of these services need to be run as root. In the event there is one, I imagine using something like `s6` might be a way around it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you're looking to integrate Jupyter**Hub**, but if so, adding support for this is something I've been looking in to (though I've been backlogged with work and research since posting). https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-hub/issues/5\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what your background is, but I'd

I'll try and do some hello world stuff with it over the next couple of days to get familiar with it and hopefully I can help you out. \r\n\r\nFor simplicity sake I like the way `linuxserver` handles user id stuff nicely.. though I did make a simple Python script the other day to do a little more complete cloning of a user, and I don't mind offering it up. The script can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usmcamp0811/campfiles/master/id-clone.py). It essentially takes in the output of `$(id <user>)` and will create that user, and all the groups the user belongs to. If there are conflicting groups in the system it will changes their `ID` to be something else.

The script looks pretty cool. 🙂 I have a few questions, though:\r\n- **How are you envisioning this being used?**\r\n- **Are you envisioning each user group being created dynamically?** For that to make it's way into the container, I believe that would need to be added as build?\r\n- **What would be a case where a single `MLWorkspace` container needs multiple groups?** (I can't think of an example, hence the question.)\r\n  - I see a case where `MLHub` might need that, but I think mounting `/etc/passwd:ro` might be a feasible solution since the IDs are needed, if that makes sense?\r\n\r\nAs for `s6-overlay` – yea, it's a great project; definitely makes it a bit easier to parse what the startup tasks are.\r\n\r\nI think, if `s6-overlay` is setup, that would make the process of `chown`-ing files much easier and less \"hacky\" as we can just set the sticky-bit on the `/workspace` folder within the container.\r\n\r\nOnce I can take a proper crack at `SystemUserSpawner` (mentioned in the other thread), I think that should resolve [almost] everything you mentioned above – and what other users have also seemed to want.\r\n\r\n`SystemUserSpawner` uses the `/etc/passwd` database to authenticate and spawn individual Jupyter sessions. In this case, running `MLHub` would spawn `MLWorkspaces` using `SystemUserSpawner`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/623171210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmuchovej","id":5000729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDA3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5000729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej","html_url":"https://github.com/jmuchovej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuchovej/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3297774528,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI5Nzc3NDUyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3297774528","actor":{"login":"usmcamp0811","id":17965629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTY1NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17965629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811","html_url":"https://github.com/usmcamp0811","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-03T19:55:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3297774529,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyOTc3NzQ1Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/3297774529","actor":{"login":"usmcamp0811","id":17965629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTY1NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17965629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811","html_url":"https://github.com/usmcamp0811","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-03T19:55:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/624400770","html_url":"https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/11#issuecomment-624400770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/11","id":624400770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDQwMDc3MA==","user":{"login":"usmcamp0811","id":17965629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTY1NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17965629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811","html_url":"https://github.com/usmcamp0811","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usmcamp0811/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T01:44:15Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06

\r\n**How are you envisioning this being used?**\r\n- I've got an environment that's pretty locked down, and all users are managed by an Active Directory.

It doesn't have to be done at build time, just run in an entrypoint script.
