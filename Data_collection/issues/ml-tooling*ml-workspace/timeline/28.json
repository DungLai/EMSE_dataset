It might be that your docker daemon is at the disk space limit and you might need to cleanup docker artifacts (e.g via [docker system prune](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/)).

changing ml-workspace from root to joyvan in the Dockerfile on a new layer blows up the image size (~8gb to ~14gb for cpu, ~17gb to ~30gb for gpu) due to file duplication caused by chmod and chown commands (the originals are kept on the preceding layers). I am considering two avenues to tackle this; there may be others:\r\n\r\n**1. Rewrite the original ml-workspaces Dockerfile**. The main issue there is that I cannot get that to build: even when completely unchanged, it fails on step 50/97 while building either jupyterlab or one of its extensions, and I am having trouble even getting a log for that failure. I could try running the preceding step and building jupyterlab from the shell...\r\n\r\n**2. Change permissions outside the build process**: Perhaps through an exec script.\r\n\r\nUnsuccessful approaches included squashing and the devicemapper storage driver (although it may still be useful within a single layer).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/StatCan/aaw-kubeflow-containers/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/StatCan/aaw-kubeflow-containers/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"LukasMasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/LukasMasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-12T21:00:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T21:00:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/56","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/56/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/56/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/56/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/pull/56","id":764238513,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTM4NDA2NzY1","number":56,"title":"Finalize
