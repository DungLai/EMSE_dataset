Indeed, the workspace should not publish any other port than 8080. It is built in a way that the tools inside are all accessible over this port and, as a result, require authentication. In your example, you should not publish port 1001 in the first place, but if you do, it is in your responsibility to secure it. I think your suggestion to make this more clear in the documentation makes a lot of sense, so we will add a note to the Section [Access Ports](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace#access-ports) or to the [FAQs](https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace#faq).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/756744029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4184303626,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE4NDMwMzYyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/4184303626","actor":{"login":"Foreist","id":46616734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjE2NzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46616734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist","html_url":"https://github.com/Foreist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-08T13:01:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4184303632,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxODQzMDM2MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/4184303632","actor":{"login":"Foreist","id":46616734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjE2NzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46616734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist","html_url":"https://github.com/Foreist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foreist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-08T13:01:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4184338473,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxODQzMzg0NzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/4184338473","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5e3266bc7303b0313d3fc23c1c90fa789072d7e8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/commits/5e3266bc7303b0313d3fc23c1c90fa789072d7e8","created_at":"2021-01-08T13:12:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"no
