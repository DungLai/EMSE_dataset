you certainly can remove most other tool installations from the Dockerfile directly, I would not recommend for doing this. It takes a lot of work, effort, and time to modifying and building the full workspace image. Instead, it is a lot more convenient to extend from the workspace image and remove selected tools from the drop down and prevent selected tools from starting. Here is an exemplary Dockerfile that demonstrates how to prevent most other tools from starting and removes all tool links other than netdata and ungit:\r\n\r\n```dockerfile\r\nFROM mltooling/ml-workspace:0.9.1\r\n\r\n# Prevent unneeded tools from starting:\r\nRUN \\\r\n    rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/filebrowser.conf && \\\r\n    rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/glances.conf && \\\r\n    rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/novnc.conf && \\\r\n    rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/sshd.conf && \\\r\n    rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/vncserver.conf && \\\r\n    rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/vscode.conf && \\\r\n    rm /etc/supervisor/conf.d/xrdp.conf\r\n\r\n# Remove unneeded tools from dropdown:\r\nRUN \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/01-novnc.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/03-jupyterlab.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/04-vscode.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/05-terminal.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/07-glances.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/08-filebrowser.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/09-access-port.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/10-ssh-access.json && \\\r\n    rm $HOME/.workspace/tools/11-install-tool.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter building the image (`docker build -t my-workspace:latest .`) and running it (`docker run -p 8080:8080 my-workspace:latest`) you will see that only ungit and netdata are available in the dropdown:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2852129/74566131-13c91500-4f73-11ea-8c6f-35e58195f54f.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/comments/586465605/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LukasMasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/LukasMasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4105331700,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDEwNTMzMTcwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/events/4105331700","actor":{"login":"LukasMasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/LukasMasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukasMasuch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-13T01:55:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
