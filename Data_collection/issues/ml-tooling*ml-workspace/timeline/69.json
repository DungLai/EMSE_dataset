@Someone894, thanks for reporting this! \r\n\r\nSo, the root cause seems to be line 181 in script `/usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates`, the `find $ETCCERTSDIR -type l ! -exec test -e {} \\;` part. The `find -exec` command does not use Linux's `test` command there, but `/opt/conda/bin/test`, which is of course wrong and throws the error with the wrong argument `-e` passed.\r\nYou can verify this by running `find $ETCCERTSDIR -type l ! -exec which test \\;` which outputs\r\n```\r\n/opt/conda/bin/test\r\n/opt/conda/bin/test\r\n/opt/conda/bin/test\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nA quick fix in your workspace is to execute either:\r\n1.  `sed -i 's@exec test@exec /usr/bin/test@g' /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates`, which replaces the test call to the specific Linux native call.\r\n2. or `export PATH=/usr/bin/:$PATH`, although I don't know whether this will have an effect on other
