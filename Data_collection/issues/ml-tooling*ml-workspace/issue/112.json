Our environment is an offline environment (both the server and the client). It takes 20~30s to open the page. Also, even if I log in to use it, it sometimes takes long time to load page after using it for more than one hour. \r\nHowever, if the server connects to the internet, then the webpage's response time becomes few seconds.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4543938/171659908-b8ef5ab0-2698-46d9-b8f3-2097cdfae749.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your issue, but please be descriptive!
