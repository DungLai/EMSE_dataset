What specific solution would you like? What is the expected behaviour? \r\n\r\nAdd any other context, screenshots, or code snippets about the feature request here as well.  \r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Problem and motivation:**\r\n\r\nIt's extremely easy to get Python or R going with ml-workspace, but it would be nice if Julia was as straightforward.\r\n\r\n<!--- \r\nWhy is this change important to you? What is the problem this feature would solve? How would you use it? How can it benefit other users?\r\n-->\r\nPersonally, I'm interested in getting more familiar with Julia and am also interested in using ml-workspace for my working environment. That's pretty much it.
