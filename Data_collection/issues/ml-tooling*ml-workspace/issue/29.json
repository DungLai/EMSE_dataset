If there is a duplicate, please close your issue and add a comment to the existing issue instead.\r\n\r\nAlso, be sure to check our documentation first: https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace\r\n-->\r\n**Describe the bug:**\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n-   Directly adding a environment.yml package to my code directory does\r\n    not automatically install the correct dependencies.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour:**\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n-   I install various dependencies including pip dependent packages to\r\n    conda environments as part of my machine learning workflows. Based\r\n    on my uncertain understanding of ‚ÄúInstalling Dependencies‚Äù\r\n    instructions, I expect that if I add a conda environment.yml to the\r\n    directory from which I run the docker container the docker container\r\n    will use the environment.yml file to initialize the base conda\r\n    environment.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n1.  Use conda to generate a environment.yml file from an existing conda\r\n    environment with additional pip installed packages.\r\n2.  Add this file to a specific home directory in which you want to\r\n    work: /user/home/folder\\_to\\_use\r\n3.  cd into this directory and run the following start command:\r\n    `sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --gpus all --name \"ml-workspace\" -v \"${PWD}:/workspace\" --env AUTHENTICATE_VIA_JUPYTER=\"mytoken\" --shm-size 512m --restart=no mltooling/ml-workspace-gpu:latest`\r\n4.  Navigate to the virtual desktop and start VSCode. The python\r\n    environment does not appear in the options menu.\r\n\r\n**Technical details:**\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n-   Workspace version: 0.9.1\r\n-   Docker version: 19.03.05\r\n-   Host Machine OS (Windows/Linux/Mac): Ubuntu 18.04\r\n-   Command used to start the workspace:\r\n    `sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --gpus all --name \"ml-workspace\" -v \"${PWD}:/workspace\" --env AUTHENTICATE_VIA_JUPYTER=\"mytoken\" --shm-size 512m --restart=no mltooling/ml-workspace-gpu:latest`\r\n-   Browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari): Firefox\r\n\r\n**Possible Fix:**\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n-   Rebuild the docker file with the necessary packages and channels\r\n    hardcoded in.\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n-   I fully acknowledge that I am most likely missing something. What is\r\n    the proper way to install various dependencies to the workspace\r\n    besides editing the dockerfile?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tbrassel","id":37461300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDYxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37461300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrassel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrassel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
