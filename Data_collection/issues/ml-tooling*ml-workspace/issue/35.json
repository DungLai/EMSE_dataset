Then have begin layering features atop, e.g. VNC, then File Browser, followed by Port Management, etc. (Presumably, these could be individually pulled without needing the prior steps.)\r\n\r\nI can (kinda) foresee some wasted time when building, e.g. needing to run: `apt-get install <some-pkg>` multiple times where `<some-pkg>` is the same, but `apt-get` already handles that for us.\r\n\r\n**Problem and motivation:**\r\nGenerally, ML tools are pretty beefy, so it's expected that you've got copious disk space for this. ðŸ˜…  However, I've found that I personally favor only a few of the built-ins of ML-Workspace. For instance, I've never used the VNC or Ungit. Additionally, I rarely use Glances or Netdata, instead preferring `gotop` (but that's honestly a familiarity thing).\r\n\r\n**Is this something you're interested in working on?**\r\n\r\nSure!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
