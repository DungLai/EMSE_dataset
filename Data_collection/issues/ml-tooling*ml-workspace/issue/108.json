What is the expected behaviour? \r\n\r\nAdd any other context, screenshots, or code snippets about the feature request here as well.  \r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Problem and motivation:**\r\n\r\nSince Anaconda changed their [Terms of Service](https://www.anaconda.com/terms-of-service), companies with more than 200 employees must purchase a license to use the Anaconda repo. My understanding is that this also prevents companies from using images like this that rely on that repo. I am hoping that we could make conda an optional part of the ML-Workspace to prevent conflicts with their ToS.\r\n\r\n<!--- \r\nWhy is this change important to you?
