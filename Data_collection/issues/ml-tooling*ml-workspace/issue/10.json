I'm using this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name \"ml-workspace\" -v \"${PWD}:/workspace\" --env AUTHENTICATE_VIA_JUPYTER=\")*==&11\" --shm-size 512m --restart always mltooling/ml-workspace:latest\r\n```\r\nIf I switch to using vanilla jupyter lab outside of docker everything is speedy again. \r\n\r\nThe time for cell execution is still accurate, it's in the order of ms, but the results arrive seconds later and the cell keeps being shown as busy with python process at a 100.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour:**\r\n\r\nReturn values with  the same speed, vanilla jupyter lab does.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"feribg","id":1943817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDM4MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1943817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg","html_url":"https://github.com/feribg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feribg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
