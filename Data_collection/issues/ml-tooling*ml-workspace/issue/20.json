Thanks again 🙌 ❤️ -->\r\nWe have a setup where we have some cloud machines with one gpu and multiple cpus, which we use for training some models. In such a context, we've tried running our usual notebooks from the ml-workspace docker image with Jupyter Notebook as well as Jupyter Lab, however we've noticed that during training or multi-process operations, only one CPU on the machine is being used. We've noticed this in netstat as well as using htop.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour:**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\nWhen running jupyter notebooks that use multiprocess operations, all cpus on the host machine should be used.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n\r\n<!-- include screenshots, logs, code or other info to help explain your problem -->\r\nHere is a piece of code we tried to run specifically to test this behaviour:\r\ndef f(x):\r\n    while True:\r\n        x*x\r\n       \r\npool = multiprocessing.Pool(3)\r\npool.map(f,range(100))\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n1.
