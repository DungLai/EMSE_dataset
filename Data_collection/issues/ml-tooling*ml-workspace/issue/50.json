Learn more by visiting http://datalad.org and even better http://handbook.datalad.org/ or listening to any [introductory talk on datalad like a recent debconf 2020]( https://saimei.ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/debian-meetings/2020/DebConf20/52-datalad-decentralized-management-of-digital-objects-for-open-science.webm) or slides from a [past presentation at MILA, Montreal](http://datasets.datalad.org/datalad/artwork/talks/2019-mila/#/) which was a little tuned for ML use-cases.\r\n\r\n**Problem and motivation:**\r\n\r\nDataLad solves many problems of version control, scalable access to remote data resources; growing amount of data is becoming available through git-annex (and thus DataLad): e.g. via http://datasets.datalad.org/ we provide access to over 200TB of (largely) neural data, and more to come!\r\n\r\n### Why is this change important to you?\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am \"involved\" in DataLad project ;-)\r\n\r\n**Is this something you're interested in working on?**\r\n\r\nI guess.  Although it might be just provision installation of DataLad within the ML workspace.  We provide Debian packages (in stock Debian and backports from http://neuro.debian.net), it is available from PyPI and also from conda-forge.  If ML is friendly to docker or singularity containers -- please also install   datalad-container  extension.\r\n\r\nDataLad comes with command line and Python APIs.  So it should work nicely for Jupyter notebooks users to access the data they want or to establish version control of their results, or even reproducible (re)execution via [datalad run](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/basics-run.html)\r\n<!--- Yes or No -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/50/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
