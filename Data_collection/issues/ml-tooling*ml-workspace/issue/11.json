I'm wondering if you might be able to provide an example of how to fit it into a standard multi-user jupyterhub + dockerspawner, where a 'start-singleuser' command spawns an image in which the primary user is not root, but jupyter's standard jovyan, and permissions are fixed accordingly. I've been attempting this, but it's proving a bit elusive to me. \r\n\r\nBasically, is there a way of combining jupyter's base-notebook stack with mlworkspace to create a single-user compatible image that could be spawned from jupyterhub?\r\n\r\n(MLHub seems like a natural step in this direction, but this would be for users who are interested in integrating MLWorkspace into their existing workflows and who might be gunshy about having single users have root permissions).\r\n\r\nMy thanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
