Histogram equalization successfully standardizes speech data for robust speech recognition (Torre et al., 2005; Harvilla & Stern, 2012). For images, we find that preprocessing with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (Pizer et al., 1987) is quite effective. Unlike our image denoising attempt (Appendix F), CLAHE reduces the effect of some corruptions while not worsening performance on most others, thereby improving the mCE. We demonstrate CLAHE’s net improvement by taking a pre-trained ResNet-50 and fine-tuning the whole model for five epochs on images processed with CLAHE. The ResNet-50 has a 23.87% error rate, but ResNet-50 with CLAHE has an error rate of 23.55%. On nearly all corruptions, CLAHE slightly decreases the Corruption Error. The ResNet-50 without CLAHE preprocessing has an mCE of 76.7%, while with CLAHE the ResNet-50’s mCE decreases to 74.5%.'\r\n\r\n##### in your repo, I can't find clahe\r\n\r\n##### I wanna know, how to use it?\r\n\r\n##### I tried two usage:\r\n1.\r\n```\r\nclahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))\r\nfor i in range(3):\r\n    img[:,:,i] = clahe.apply(img[:,:,i]) \r\n```\r\n2. \r\n```\r\nclahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))\r\nframe = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB)\r\nframe[:,:,0] = clahe.apply(frame[:,:,0])\r\nframe = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_LAB2BGR)\r\n```\r\n* for the one part, I don't know which usage is correct\r\n* for the other, I don't know which number clipLimit,tileGridSize should be set\r\n\r\nCould you help me with the answer?\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
