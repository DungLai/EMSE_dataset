When calculating mFR or mT5D for imagenet-p, should the three different difficulties for the three noises be taken into account as well?\r\n\r\n2) I guess the weights used for noises with difficulty levels vary from dataset to dataset.\r\n For example, in `make_imagenet_p.py`, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.08 are used for gaussian noise weights, whereas in `make_cifar_p.py`, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.06 are used. Are these values determined with any rules?\r\n If I want to make -p data with some new datasets, can I just use the weight values for imagenet-p?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
