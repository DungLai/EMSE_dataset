I have run make_tinyimagenet_c.py for the validation dataset of Tiny ImageNet and tested the accuracy of a trained model on Gaussian noise. For the compressed images and severity=3, I get an accuracy of around 20%, and if I recreate the dataset, the accuracy is around 31%. Since recreating the dataset saves the new corrupted images as JPEGs, the compression should not be the issue.\r\n\r\nI am using a resnet-18 for my evaluation.\r\n\r\nDo you know how that might happen?","closed_by":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
