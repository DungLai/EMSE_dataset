That implementation has rescaling which cv2 does not have. However cv2 is much faster, so an implementation with cv2 can look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef rescale(x):\r\n    x_min, x_max = x.min(), x.max()\r\n    return np.uint8(np.clip((x - x_min)/float(x_max - x_min + 1e-8), 0, 1) * 255)\r\n\r\n\r\nclahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2 tileGridSize=(8, 8))\r\n\r\n\r\nclass HistEq(object):\r\n    # def __init__(self):\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, x):\r\n        x = cv2.cvtColor(np.array(x), cv2.COLOR_RGB2LAB)\r\n        l = x[:,:,0]\r\n        lmin, lmax = l.min(), l.max()\r\n        return cv2.cvtColor(np.concatenate((clahe.apply(np.uint8((l - lmin) / (lmax - lmin + 1e-8) * 255))[...,None], x[:,:,1:]), axis=2),\r\n                            cv2.COLOR_LAB2RGB)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can e-mail you the weights for the fine-tuned model if you want.\r\nAs it happens, [I recently updated the paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJz6tiCqYm) to mention a more exciting technique that beats CLAHE significantly. Fine-tuning with \"Stylized ImageNet\" significantly outperforms fine-tuning with CLAHE applied to images.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/comments/451084519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2051890782,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA1MTg5MDc4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/events/2051890782","actor":{"login":"hendrycks","id":11670606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrycks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-03T08:54:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/comments/451086628","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness/issues/9#issuecomment-451086628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hendrycks/robustness/issues/9","id":451086628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTA4NjYyOA==","user":{"login":"bei-startdt","id":29249785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjQ5Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29249785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt","html_url":"https://github.com/bei-startdt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bei-startdt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-03T09:05:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T09:05:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank U very much.
