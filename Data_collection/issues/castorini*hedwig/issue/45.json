Migrating to `huggingface/transformers` would provide hedwig access to a wider range of models such as XLNet and TransformerXL. Document classification is a very good use case for those models as they solve the fixed-length context problem we have with BERT. Further, we have duplicate copies of huggingface code just sitting around in hedwig and it's quite messy.","closed_by":{"login":"achyudh","id":7617287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTcyODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7617287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh","html_url":"https://github.com/achyudh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achyudh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/castorini/hedwig/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/castorini/hedwig/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
