When I wrote this code for the LSTM stock model the input date worked without specifying a formatting argument to the arrow.get() function. \r\n\r\nI was running this today and ran into problems with the \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format as without a formatting argument, it assumes another format and thus returns tweets for the wrong dates. When we know our date format we can add the argument to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\nArrow documentation: http://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bshaw2019/Crypto_Trader/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bshaw2019/Crypto_Trader/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
