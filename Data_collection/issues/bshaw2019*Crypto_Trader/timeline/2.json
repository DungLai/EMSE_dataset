These could be used to generate predictions for both reward (projected profit from the regressor) and risk (the confidence value for a price increase or decrease move). I think building these models for a variety of timeframes for all symbols (example: 1 min price change, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour) will provide the Q-learning trader with enough information to determine an optimized trading strategy that both reduces risk and rewards profit.
