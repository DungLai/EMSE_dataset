The way we generated Linux kernel LLVM IR files was very similar to yours - we switched the compiler to clang, and when building the kernel we logged all commands (verbose mode). Following that, we swapped every `-o <file.o>` with `-S -emit-llvm -o <file.ll>` in clang build commands.\r\n\r\nI do not exactly know why you are able to generate more LLVM-IR files, perhaps the script you found is better at detecting build commands, or (which is more likely IMO) your kernel configuration included additional kernel modules that we did not compile.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spcl/ncc/issues/comments/536273813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tbennun","id":8348955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDg5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8348955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun","html_url":"https://github.com/tbennun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2683776050,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY4Mzc3NjA1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spcl/ncc/issues/events/2683776050","actor":{"login":"Baumanar","id":32865396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODY1Mzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32865396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar","html_url":"https://github.com/Baumanar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baumanar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-03T11:55:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
