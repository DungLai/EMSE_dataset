To get the source code, simply browse to those projects and download the codes. \r\n\r\nWe compiled the files from the original dataset sources using the `clang` compiler and the following flags: `-S -emit-llvm`. Trying to compile source files individually from the original code is not always simple (proper include folders need to be added for each file), so sometimes (e.g., in the Linux kernel) we modified the Makefile or configuration to add those flags. For example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ clang -S -emit-llvm file.cpp -o file.ll\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to augment the training dataset, we also compile each file under different permutations of the available compiler flags we tested (-O0...-O3, fast math, etc.).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spcl/ncc/issues/comments/699456761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tbennun","id":8348955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDg5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8348955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun","html_url":"https://github.com/tbennun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbennun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spcl/ncc/issues/comments/723236319","html_url":"https://github.com/spcl/ncc/issues/29#issuecomment-723236319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spcl/ncc/issues/29","id":723236319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzIzNjMxOQ==","user":{"login":"LIANGKE23","id":55468383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDY4Mzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55468383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23","html_url":"https://github.com/LIANGKE23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIANGKE23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T18:36:53Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T18:36:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nCan
