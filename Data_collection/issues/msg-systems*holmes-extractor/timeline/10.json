@cruncher64, the design of Holmes does not differentiate between nouns and verbs within ontologies: the relationship between the two verbs in the example you give should be treated in the same way as a relationship between two nouns, and indeed this test works where 'walk' is defined as a subclass as 'move' in the ontology:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport holmes_extractor as holmes\r\nontology = holmes.Ontology('ontology.owl')\r\nmanager = holmes.Manager('en_core_web_trf', ontology=ontology)\r\nmanager.register_search_phrase(\"An ENTITYPERSON moves\")\r\nmanager.parse_and_register_document(\"Richard Hudson walked\")\r\nmanager.match()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a problem either with how one of the sentences is being parsed or with the ontology definition?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msg-systems/holmes-extractor/issues/comments/1139745755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"richardpaulhudson","id":28650805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjUwODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28650805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson","html_url":"https://github.com/richardpaulhudson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6693512848,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCvmPZs5I8VKWzwAAAAGO9uaQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msg-systems/holmes-extractor/issues/events/6693512848","actor":{"login":"cruncher64","id":71754479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzU0NDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71754479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64","html_url":"https://github.com/cruncher64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-27T15:55:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6693512852,"node_id":"SE_lADOCvmPZs5I8VKWzwAAAAGO9uaU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msg-systems/holmes-extractor/issues/events/6693512852","actor":{"login":"cruncher64","id":71754479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzU0NDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71754479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64","html_url":"https://github.com/cruncher64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cruncher64/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-27T15:55:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6693515111,"node_id":"CE_lADOCvmPZs5I8VKWzwAAAAGO9u9n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msg-systems/holmes-extractor/issues/events/6693515111","actor":{"login":"richardpaulhudson","id":28650805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjUwODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28650805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson","html_url":"https://github.com/richardpaulhudson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardpaulhudson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-27T15:55:27
