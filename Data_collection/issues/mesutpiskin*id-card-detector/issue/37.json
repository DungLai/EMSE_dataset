I tried some images of my smart phone and wallet.  It detects them as id-card with high score.\r\n\r\nCould you comment on the type of images you used in training or share a better model if you have? \r\n\r\nAlso a comment on the evaluation scores would be really helpful!\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesutpiskin/id-card-detector/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mesutpiskin/id-card-detector/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
