sequence by non-int of type 'float'\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nFor anyone who may bump into this issue in future, I resolved it by adding `.values()` for the following line in **train.py**:\r\n```\r\n(lm_loss), (mc_loss), *_ = model(\r\n        input_ids, token_type_ids=token_type_ids, mc_token_ids=mc_token_ids,\r\n        mc_labels=mc_labels, labels=labels\r\n).values()\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/1243840419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tjtanjin","id":43908963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTA4OTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43908963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin","html_url":"https://github.com/tjtanjin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtanjin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7368236184,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCwz_ac4cTuuLzwAAAAG3LlyY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/7368236184","actor":{"login":"wise-east","id":31977186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTc3MTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31977186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east","html_url":"https://github.com/wise-east","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-12T14:37:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7368236198,"node_id":"SE_lADOCwz_ac4cTuuLzwAAAAG3Llym","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/7368236198","actor":{"login":"wise-east","id":31977186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTc3MTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31977186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east","html_url":"https://github.com/wise-east","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wise-east/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-12T14:37:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
