I want to move beyond multi-GPU single-node fine-tuning (which is what this repo currently seems to support) to full-scale distributed fine-tuning with several nodes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/542059309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"g-karthik","id":3851993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTE5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3851993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik","html_url":"https://github.com/g-karthik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2712706079,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjcxMjcwNjA3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/2712706079","actor":{"login":"williamFalcon","id":3640001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDAwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3640001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon","html_url":"https://github.com/williamFalcon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-15T06:29:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2712706080,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3MTI3MDYwODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/2712706080","actor":{"login":"williamFalcon","id":3640001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDAwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3640001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon","html_url":"https://github.com/williamFalcon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-15T06:29:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
