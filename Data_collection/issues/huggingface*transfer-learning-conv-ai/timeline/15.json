@gorkemgoknar @thomwolf , I want to ask about trainind different languages according to an article. \r\n [https://medium.com/huggingface/how-to-build-a-state-of-the-art-conversational-ai-with-transfer-learning-2d818ac26313](url)\r\nAccording to this, it says start by pretraining a language model on a very large corpus of text to be able to generate long stretches of contiguous coherent text, fine-tune this language model to adapt it to our end-task: dialog. And I want to train first like Turkish Wikipedia data and then, fine tune with Turkish Dialogue Data.\r\nAnd is there any suggestion about this problem?
