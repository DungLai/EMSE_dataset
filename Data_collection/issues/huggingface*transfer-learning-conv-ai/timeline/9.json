workaround would be to guard the `apex` import with `if torch.cuda.is_available()`.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion won't work, since\r\n`torch.version.cuda` returns the CUDA version (e.g. `10.0.130`), while `torch.__version__` returns the PyTorch version (e.g. `1.3.0.dev20190923`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/536608226/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ptrblck","id":11662379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYyMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11662379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrblck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrblck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2673672566,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY3MzY3MjU2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/2673672566","actor":{"login":"DannyDannyDanny","id":16453674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDUzNjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16453674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny","html_url":"https://github.com/DannyDannyDanny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-30T15:12:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2673672568,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NzM2NzI1Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/2673672568","actor":{"login":"DannyDannyDanny","id":16453674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDUzNjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16453674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny","html_url":"https://github.com/DannyDannyDanny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyDannyDanny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-30T15:12:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/599251206","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/9#issuecomment-599251206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/9","id":599251206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTI1MTIwNg==","user":{"login":"shamoons","id":1019677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk2Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons","html_url":"https://github.com/shamoons","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamoons/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s
