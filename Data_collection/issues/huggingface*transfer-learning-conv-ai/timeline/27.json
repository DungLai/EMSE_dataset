I am using your codebase, thank you for for making the adaptation. \r\n\r\nIn `train.py`: \r\n\r\nI believe you are adding the special tokens incorrectly. Your `SPECIAL_TOKEN` dict currently looks like: \r\n```\r\nSPECIAL_TOKENS = {\"bos_token\": \"<bos>\", \r\n                  \"eos_token\": \"<eos>\",\r\n                  \"speaker1_token\": \"<speaker1>\", \r\n                  \"speaker2_token\": \"<speaker2>\",\r\n                  \"pad_token\": \"<pad>\"}\r\n```\r\nThe `additional_special_tokens` have been added incorrectly, it should look like this: \r\n```\r\nSPECIAL_TOKENS = {\"bos_token\" : \"<bos>\", \r\n                  \"eos_token\" : \"<eos>\", \r\n                  \"additional_special_tokens\" : [\"<speaker2>\", \"<speaker1>\"],\r\n                  \"pad_token\" : \"<pad>\" } \r\n```\r\nI am unsure of a neat way to unpack that dict so I also define: \r\n```\r\nspecial_tokens = ['<bos>', '<eos>', '<speaker1>', '<speaker2>']\r\n```\r\nthat needs to be used as input for [`tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(...)`](https://github.com/wise-east/transfer-learning-conv-ai/blob/master/train.py#L57).\r\n\r\nIn `interact.py` similar modifications need to made. \r\n\r\n1. `from train import special_tokens`,\r\n2. ` tokenizer.add_special_tokens(SPECIAL_TOKENS)` after the tokenizer has been initialised,\r\n3. Add `special_tokens_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(special_tokens)` to the function [`sample_sequence(...)`](https://github.com/wise-east/transfer-learning-conv-ai/blob/master/interact.py#L58)\r\n\r\nSlightly off topic: [lines 136-141](https://github.com/wise-east/transfer-learning-conv-ai/blob/master/interact.py#L136), seem to be incorrectly commented out, is this for debugging purposes? \r\n\r\nI think that is all the changes I have made. Let me know how you get on.  \r\n\r\nEdit: Are you going to submit a pull request to the original repo?

I feel like there was something wrong with the final LM weights in the pretrained model that just needed to be retrained/finetuned with whatever dataset you have. \r\n\r\nI'll work through making the corrections and look into if I can make a pull request without causing too much of a hassle.
