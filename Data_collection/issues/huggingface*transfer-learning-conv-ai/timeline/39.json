after a moderate dive through the code and printing relevant tensors, I'm guessing this is happening because `lm_labels`  has a bunch of -1s to mask the context (and the negative candidates) for the LM head, and that is throwing the Precision and Recall classes in pytorch-ignite off, unlike the CrossEntropyLoss class, which has `ignore_index=-1` to handle the -1s.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there's an equivalent for `ignore_index` for Precision and Recall, or if I'd have to handle them by modifying the `output_transform` lambda.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/542053614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"g-karthik","id":3851993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTE5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3851993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik","html_url":"https://github.com/g-karthik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/542459086","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/39#issuecomment-542459086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/39","id":542459086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjQ1OTA4Ng==","user":{"login":"g-karthik","id":3851993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTE5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3851993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik","html_url":"https://github.com/g-karthik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T00:30:10Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T00:30:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Created
