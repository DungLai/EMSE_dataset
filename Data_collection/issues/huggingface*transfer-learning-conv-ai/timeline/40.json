that!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/574429078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sshleifer","id":6045025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDUwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6045025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer","html_url":"https://github.com/sshleifer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2949930040,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk0OTkzMDA0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/2949930040","actor":{"login":"sshleifer","id":6045025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDUwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6045025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer","html_url":"https://github.com/sshleifer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-15T08:41:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2949930041,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NDk5MzAwNDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/events/2949930041","actor":{"login":"sshleifer","id":6045025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDUwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6045025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer","html_url":"https://github.com/sshleifer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshleifer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-15T08:41:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/comments/574555031","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/40#issuecomment-574555031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/40","id":574555031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDU1NTAzMQ==","user":{"login":"dimeldo","id":20453742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUzNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20453742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo","html_url":"https://github.com/dimeldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimeldo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T08:42:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T08:42:17Z","author_association
