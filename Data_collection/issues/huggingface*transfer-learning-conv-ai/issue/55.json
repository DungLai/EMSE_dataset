Based on the [overall README](https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai#pretrained-model), I might expect to be able to run interact.py without any arguments, but this doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR:pytorch_pretrained_bert.modeling_openai:Model name '' was not found in model name list (openai-gpt). We assumed '' was a path or url but couldn't find files pytorch_model.bin and config.json at this path or url.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"question-generation/interact.py\", line 238, in <module>\r\n    run()\r\n  File \"question-generation/interact.py\", line 149, in run\r\n    model.to(args.device)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is ok, I downloaded a pretrained model myself from Google drive and tried interact.py again (`python3 question-generation/interact.py --model_checkpoint ~/Downloads/gpt2_corefs_question_generation/`). When I did so, I first hit the below issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"question-generation/interact.py\", line 238, in <module>\r\n    run()\r\n  File \"question-generation/interact.py\", line 152, in run\r\n    data = get_positional_dataset_from_file(tokenizer, args.filename)\r\n  File \"/Users/amooren/Code/squash-generation/question-generation/dataloader.py\", line 81, in get_positional_dataset_from_file\r\n    with open(file, 'rb') as f:\r\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/instances_dev.pkl'\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading the overall README, I inferred that I needed to download instances_dev.pkl, and I found something closely named instances_dev.pickle and instances_coref_dev.pickle [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FlVtPgyBiJIEOIecnNLH3cg0EbKkK0Z4). I assumed I'd need the coref labeled one, as the pretrained folder is named \"gpt2_**corefs**_question_generation\". But when I tried to use this, I hit the next issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"question-generation/interact.py\", line 238, in <module>\r\n    run()\r\n  File \"question-generation/interact.py\", line 168, in run\r\n    para_index = inst[\"para_index\"]\r\nKeyError: 'para_index'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould you mind clarifying the steps to test out just this component? It would greatly speed up my efforts.","closed_by":{"login":"mooreniemi","id":1695630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTU2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1695630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi","html_url":"https://github.com/mooreniemi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mooreniemi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
