However, I am unable to fine-tune GPT-2 medium on the same instance with the exact same hyper-parameters - I'm getting out of memory issues, presumably because GPT-2 medium is much larger than GPT-2 small. I haven't tried fine-tuning GPT-2 medium using Persona-Chat yet though.\r\n\r\nHave you tried fine-tuning GPT-2 medium (from the `attention` branch in pytorch-pretrained-BERT) on large dialog datasets with long turns and if so, could you share the details of the underlying hardware used?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"g-karthik","id":3851993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTE5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3851993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik","html_url":"https://github.com/g-karthik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-karthik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/14/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
