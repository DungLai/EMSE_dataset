I have adapted the file. However, when I try to run the code, I get the following error: \r\n\r\n```shell\r\n>>> hello\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/timospring/Desktop/empathic-chatbot/code/bertBot.py\", line 169, in <module>\r\n    run()\r\n  File \"/Users/timospring/Desktop/empathic-chatbot/code/bertBot.py\", line 161, in run\r\n    out_ids = sample_sequence(history, tokenizer, model, args)\r\n  File \"/Users/timospring/Desktop/empathic-chatbot/code/bertBot.py\", line 70, in sample_sequence\r\n    logits = model(input_ids, token_type_ids=token_type_ids)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py\", line 489, in __call__\r\n    result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/transformers/modeling_bert.py\", line 624, in forward\r\n    embedding_output = self.embeddings(input_ids, position_ids=position_ids, token_type_ids=token_type_ids)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py\", line 489, in __call__\r\n    result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/transformers/modeling_bert.py\", line 169, in forward\r\n    token_type_embeddings = self.token_type_embeddings(token_type_ids)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py\", line 489, in __call__\r\n    result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/sparse.py\", line 118, in forward\r\n    self.norm_type, self.scale_grad_by_freq, self.sparse)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py\", line 1454, in embedding\r\n    return torch.embedding(weight, input, padding_idx, scale_grad_by_freq, sparse)\r\nRuntimeError: index out of range at /Users/soumith/b101_2/2019_02_08/wheel_build_dirs/wheel_3.7/pytorch/aten/src/TH/generic/THTensorEvenMoreMath.cpp:191\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did some digging and this error is supposed to appear when there is a mismatch in the vocab_size.

Any help in getting it to work with bert would be highly appreciated! \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tiimoS","id":26149808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTQ5ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26149808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS","html_url":"https://github.com/tiimoS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiimoS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
