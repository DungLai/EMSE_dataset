(From the image with blue/pink/green instances).\r\nIn the code, it somehow takes the sequence input's first persona part as speaker1, the utterance of speaker1 as speaker2 and so on. \r\nIt will be grateful if you could clarify these terms for me. \r\nThanks :) \r\n\r\nBelow is the code I tried to run from the post. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90023054/205885170-76087d41-fa93-4fd9-8cd8-59526af77355.png)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
