My pytorch-pretrained-bert version is already the latest, which is 0.6.2. The problem that occurred:\r\n1. There was unicode error when loading vocab.json from GPT2Tokenizer. I added utf-8 encoding to the open json file function and the problem is gone... hopefully\r\n2. There was dimension mismatch when loading convai pretrained model's weight. I looked at the source code at the installed pytorch-pretrained-bert and compared it with the github repo and realized that in the installed version, modeling_gpt2.py doesn't have set_num_special_tokens function to add persona chat special tokens. I copied the modeling_gpt2.py from github to my installed folder and the problem is gone... hopefully as well\r\n3.
