Am I missing something here or is this an issue that needs to be resolved? I can imagine training a model from scratch using the training script would work since these weights will be trained, but I would like to be able to use the pretrained model for cost/time reasons. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"julien-c","id":326577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjU3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c","html_url":"https://github.com/julien-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
