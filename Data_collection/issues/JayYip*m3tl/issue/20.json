My task is \"cls1&cls2&cls3\" task. 1. For the classification task, the model uses pre-trained BERT to obtain a sentence representation of each input, how does this representation generate (how is it pooled)? 2. what is the loss function of classification task? 3. the loss using for backpropagation is the mean of these three classification losses, is it correct? 4. During the backpropagation, the model whether updates entire model (include BERT) or only the top layer.
