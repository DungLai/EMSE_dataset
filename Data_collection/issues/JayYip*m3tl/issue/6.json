I am working on training BERT on multiple GPUs these days (using official code released by Google Research) and after specifying the Run_Config of the estimator with MirroredStrategy, I encountered an \"ValueError: You must specify an aggregation method to update a MirroredVariable in Tower Context.\" This error was the same with that in [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/23986#issuecomment-444389363](url) and I found your reply below. You said \"You can take my implementation as a reference:\", and therefore I came to this repo. \r\nI modified the original optimization.py code with reference to your src/optimizer.py but still got the same error, could you give me some advice about how to re-implement the optimizer in original optimization.py? \r\nThe original official code of optimization.py is here [https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/optimization.py](url)","closed_by":{"login":"JayYip","id":15050572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUwNTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15050572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip","html_url":"https://github.com/JayYip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JayYip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JayYip/m3tl/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JayYip/m3tl/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
