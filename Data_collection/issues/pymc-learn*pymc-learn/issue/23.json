I think it would be best to change the `requirements.txt` file to use `>=` instead of `==` wherever possible, unless it has been demonstrated that newer versions of specific dependencies genuinely exhibit incompatibilities. Otherwise, it might be better to warn prospective users that they ought to create a brand new virtual environment to use this package.","closed_by":{"login":"Emaasit","id":7738216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzgyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7738216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit","html_url":"https://github.com/Emaasit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emaasit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pymc-learn/pymc-learn/issues/23/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pymc-learn/pymc-learn/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
