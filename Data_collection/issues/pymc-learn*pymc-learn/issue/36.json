See the [project documentation](https://jupyter-sphinx.readthedocs.io) for details.\r\n\r\nWe have released 0.2.0rc1 on pip, please give it a shot using `pip install 0.2.0rc1 --pre` â€” we would love to hear your feedback.\r\nPlease also let us know by responding here or in https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/jupyter-sphinx/issues/33 if the new release disrupts your workflow.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pymc-learn/pymc-learn/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pymc-learn/pymc-learn/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
