will have an experimental support for native complex type in pytorch (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/755), which would result in some performance improvements and code quality improvements for free. \r\n\r\nThe CPU part will be implemented based on my previous effort (in short term): https://github.com/Roger-luo/pytorch/tree/complex-cpu-backend/aten/src/THZ\r\n\r\nThe following work will be done in a new repo (which will be move to pytorch.org's repo later): https://github.com/Roger-luo/THZ\r\n\r\nas a plugin based on new plugin interface: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/11216\r\n\r\nFurther discussion can be found in pytorch's slack channel: complex-numbers (send an email for invitation first).
