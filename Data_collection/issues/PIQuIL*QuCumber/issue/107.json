I followed all installation procedures from the https://qucumber.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html. After installing Pytorch with Anaconda, install of QuCumber was a brease. Jupyter notebook was running fine, but I started getting errors from Matplotlib, and could not get first example to complete the plotting part. \r\n\r\nI did not have Latex running on the system, so I installed MikTex, but properly updating Environment PAth Variable for Matplotlib is tricky, and issue was still there. Then, I found this https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3131, and basically simply forced re-install of Matplotlib. That has fixed the problem. I will try to figure out how to update installation instructions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZvonimir","closed_by":{"login":"ZvonimirBandic","id":1168675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1168675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic","html_url":"https://github.com/ZvonimirBandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZvonimirBandic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
