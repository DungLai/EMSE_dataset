sorry for the delay, I've fixed the relevant bug, so try updating QuCumber and running your code again.\r\n\r\nOne error I did notice in your code, however, is in this snippet:\r\n`MetricEvaluator(1,{\"KL\":ts.KL})`\r\n\r\nYou are missing a few keyword arguments that are needed for `ts.KL` (see the docs [here](https://qucumber.readthedocs.io/en/stable/training_statistics.html)), like `space`, `target_psi`, etc. You need to pass these through `MetricEvaluator` as you did further up in your code. The proper call should be something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMetricEvaluator(1, {\"KL\":ts.KL}, target_psi=true_psi, bases=bases, space=space)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure why you want to create *another* `MetricEvaluator` object when you've already created one earlier, you could just assign the first one to a variable and pass it to `EarlyStopping`, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmetric_eval = MetricEvaluator(\r\n    1,\r\n    {\"Fidelity\": ts.fidelity, \"KL\":ts.KL, \"Coef\":psi_coefficient},\r\n    target_psi=true_psi,\r\n    bases=bases,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n    space=space,       \r\n)\r\ncallbacks = [\r\n    metric_eval,\r\n    EarlyStopping(1, 0.01, 10, metric_eval, \"KL\", \"absolute\")\r\n]  \r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/528170936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/528430187","html_url":"https://github.com/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/91#issuecomment-528430187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/91","id":528430187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODQzMDE4Nw==","user":{"login":"andriusdc","id":49077073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49077073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc","html_url":"https://github.com/andriusdc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T15:40:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T15:40:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello again !
