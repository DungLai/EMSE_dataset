If we end up basing the training loop around `yield` or `yield from`, users will need to learn about co-routines in order to do anything slightly more complicated than a basic training loop.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/429464200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1901762757,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5MDE3NjI3NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/events/1901762757","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-12T21:44:17Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1912977233,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkxMjk3NzIzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/events/1912977233","actor":{"login":"Roger-luo","id":8445510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8445510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo","html_url":"https://github.com/Roger-luo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roger-luo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-18T18:12:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
