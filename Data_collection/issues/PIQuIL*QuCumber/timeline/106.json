This might be what you want. But if you want to save to different files every epoch, you should pass something like: `modelo_{}`, this is a format string with one blank (the {}) which will be replaced with the epoch number or the word \"initial\" depending on what stage of training you're at. \r\n\r\nTo load up the model from a file, you'd need to know what type of quantum state you trained.\r\nSay for example, you trained a `PositiveWaveFunction`, you'd use this command to reload the model from the file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel = PositiveWaveFunction.autoload(file_path)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/583880203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3050341591,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA1MDM0MTU5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/events/3050341591","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-19T05:46:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
