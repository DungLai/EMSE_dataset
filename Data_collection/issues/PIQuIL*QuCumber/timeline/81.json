Note that both of these quantities require you to know the true wavefunction that you'd like to fit against, so they are only really useful for simple examples such as those shown in the tutorials.\r\n\r\nFor large systems you really just shouldn't be computing the partition function in the first place, and often-times the true wavefunction itself may not be known or may not be feasible to store in memory due to the exponential scaling in the number of lattice sites. In such cases training statistics like fidelity and KL are impossible to calculate, so you probably don't even need the partition function in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn the tutorial 1 you can prevent computation of the partition function by not passing the `MetricEvaluator` callback to the fit function. You will however no longer be able to run the rest of the tutorial following the training step as those cells require data produced by the `MetricEvaluator`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/478185685/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/478621291","html_url":"https://github.com/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/81#issuecomment-478621291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/81","id":478621291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODYyMTI5MQ==","user":{"login":"andriusdc","id":49077073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49077073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc","html_url":"https://github.com/andriusdc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T15:15:09Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T15:15:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your answer !\r\n\r\nSo, if I am studying large systems, what should I do to get information about the state ?
