has been done on this in the `layers` branch.\r\n\r\nFor now it doesn't seem like this way of structuring the RBMs will work out, for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- `torch.matmul` and `torch.einsum` currently aren't memory efficient in the sense that they don't allow overwriting an existing tensor, so we *could* implement things this way, but we'd just end up reintroducing the memory leak from #19 \r\n    - `torch.tensordot` would likely be a faster alternative to `torch.einsum`, but it doesn't exist yet (hopefully it'll support an `out` parameter)\r\n- sampling a full RBM is currently a little bit tricky since we need an initial state which must have the valid format (in the sense that the tensor has the right shape); this shouldn't be too hard to fix, since we just need to implement a `generate_state` in each `Layer` class, and then call the method on the visible layer when we sample the RBM\r\n\r\nThe first two bullets will hopefully be resolved once PyTorch 0.4.1 is released in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this new method seems to be *slightly* slower:\r\nFor a Binary(10) to Binary(10) RBM, generating 1000 samples through 10000 gibbs steps was about 0.15s slower using the layer-based structure. In relative terms, the deviation is more than a few standard deviations, but in absolute terms, it is fairly trivial, at least for small system sizes.\r\n\r\nThis slow down is likely due to the increased level of indirection required by this layout; there may be ways to optimize this though (`torch.jit`?, metaprograming?)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/407869270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1755384110,"node_id":"MDE5OkFkZGVkVG9Qcm9qZWN0RXZlbnQxNzU1Mzg0MTEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/events/1755384110","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-26T15:49:29Z","project_card":{"id":11645394,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/11645394","project_id":1546841,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/1546841","column_name":"In
