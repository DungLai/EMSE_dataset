The thing is that I measured on the lab the basis Z and X on the first qubit, and Z+X and Z-X on the second, so I can't change my basis so I can get some Z-Z measurement, cause I didn't measured the same operator on both qubits. Is it really impossible to avoid that measurement in the Z-Z basis ? Can't I declare to the package that my wavefunction is on another basis ?\r\nAbout the second error, the message that I posted is the complete error message. I believe that the error is on the dictionary because it works if I change the keyword A to Y. If the unitaries are declared as X,Y,Z, it works, regardless of how those matrix are defined. The thing is that I need more than 3 unitaries, and when I pick any letter for naming that fourth one, I get that KeyError.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/511832380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andriusdc","id":49077073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49077073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc","html_url":"https://github.com/andriusdc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriusdc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/comments/511872072","html_url":"https://github.com/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/90#issuecomment-511872072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/90","id":511872072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTg3MjA3Mg==","user":{"login":"mbeach42","id":8442696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDI2OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8442696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeach42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeach42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T15:42:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T15:42:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--- Regard (1), I think you have to define \r\n\r\n![CodeCogsEqn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8442696/61308271-e2f6e680-a7bd-11e9-87e2-4ab6ed63c9b7.gif)\r\n![CodeCogsEqn(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8442696/61308278-e8ecc780-a7bd-11e9-8202-366c6ff017cc.gif)\r\nSo now your measurements are in the ![CodeCogsEqn(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8442696/61308377-26e9eb80-a7be-11e9-9f14-cb1f90e8a5d7.gif) basis. \r\n--->\r\n\r\nRegarding (2), Can you confirm that the following code gives no error? \r\n\r\n```Ux = torch.tensor ([[[np.divide(1,np.sqrt(2)),np.divide(1,np.sqrt(2))],[np.divide(1,np.sqrt(2)),-np.divide(1,np.sqrt(2))]], np.zeros((2,2))], dtype=torch.double)\r\nUz = torch.tensor ([np.identity(2),np.zeros((2,2))], dtype=torch.double)\r\nUa = torch.tensor ([np.real(Ry(-45)), np.imag(Ry(-45))], dtype=torch.double)\r\nUb = torch.tensor ([np.real(Ry(45)), np.imag(Ry(45))], dtype=torch.double)\r\n                    \r\nunitary_dict = unitaries.create_dict(Z=Uz,X=Ux, A=Ua, B=Ub)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis runs fine on my computer.
