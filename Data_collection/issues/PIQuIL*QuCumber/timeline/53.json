Guys,\r\n\r\nLove the effort with this! I'm happy to help drive it home. I am, however, not familiar with cuda and my cpp is at least 5 years rusty haha. However, with a bit of guidance, I can probably make something happen here.\r\n\r\nLike you guys, I'm also a fulltime student, so my contributions might be limited.\r\n\r\nI finally compiled the extension but it looks to be broken atm (i suspect it might be a pt issue).\r\n```\r\n>>> from torch_complex import torch\r\n>>>\r\n>>> torch.ones(4,3, dtype=torch.complex64)\r\ntensor([[(5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j)],\r\n        [(5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j)],\r\n        [(5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j)],\r\n        [(5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315+5.263544247e-315j), (5.263544247e-315-1.4916681462400413e-154j)]],\r\n       dtype=torch.complex64)\r\n>>> torch.ones(4,3, dtype=torch.complex64) * 5\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nRuntimeError: empty_strided is not implemented for type CPUComplexTensor<float>\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have implemented all the complex operations in this repo ([/williamFalcon/pytorch-complex-tensor](https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-complex-tensor).   The problem with my implementation is that it just manipulates real tensors as complex and gradients don't match the tensorflow gradient computation...\r\nhttps://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-complex-tensor/blob/master/Complex%20demo%20example.ipynb\r\n\r\nI suspect to get this to actually work, I'm going to need to have complex scalar support which seems can only be done in cpp...?  \r\n\r\n**The way I see it, we could probably make this happen in 1 of 2 ways:**\r\n1. You guys take in what I have into your code to get the operations working correctly? (this might already be done, but looks broken).\r\n2. Happy to do a crash course in what I need to know to get this implemented into your library (which files to edit, etc...) and I can do the port.\r\n3. ?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have probably 1-2 days I can allocate to get this done.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** - I was able to figure out how to get gradient support for my project. Still happy to join forces to get PT complex support added.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Roger-luo/pytorch-complex/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Roger-luo/pytorch-complex/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2789086164,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3ODkwODYxNjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/events/2789086164","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T19:40:55Z","label":{"name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2789086294,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc4OTA4NjI5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PIQuIL/QuCumber/issues/events/2789086294","actor":{"login":"emerali","id":6067067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjcwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6067067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali","html_url":"https://github.com/emerali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emerali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T19:40:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
