It appeared no problem on my PC with powerful GPU - RTX 2080. However, with mediocre GPU on laptop (Quadro M1000M) and embedded system (Jetson TX2), the program constantly complained about \"too many resources requested to launch\". The following shows the complete error message, which was triggered in function *predict_given_factorization* in mgpr.py.\r\n\r\n> F tensorflow/core/kernels/determinant_op_gpu.cu.cc:137] Non-OK-status: CudaLaunchKernel( DeterminantFromPivotedLUKernel<Scalar, false>, config.block_count, config.thread_per_block, 0, device.stream(), config.virtual_thread_count, n, lu_factor.data(), pivots, nullptr, output.data()) status: Internal: too many resources requested for launch\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone encountered this problem before.
