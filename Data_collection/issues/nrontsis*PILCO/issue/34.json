I want to optimize the controller for various target values depending on an input target state.  I'm planning to add the difference (of one of the states)  of the target state and the momentary value as an extra control dimension. \r\nAs a result of that the model would be dependant on the states, but the controller would be dependant on the states and e.g. the difference x1_target - x1.  \r\nBy setting the target value of the extra control dimension zero and putting in data with different target states I should be able to optimize the controller for different inputs. \r\nDo you know an easy way to do this or something similar to take account for different targets like e.g. a vehicle controller where you set different curvatures to get a controller.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help,\r\nManuel","closed_by":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
