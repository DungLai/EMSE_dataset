If you spend time on writing comments, we would be very happy if you were to make a PR so as to incorporate (some of) them in the main repo. We plan on adding more documentation & examples soon, and while writing them it would be helpful to get feedback from other people.\r\n\r\nThe delta comes because the datasets X, Y you provide to PILCO should be of the form:\r\n```\r\nX[i] = [state at time i;\r\n       control action at time i]\r\nY[i] = (state at time i + 1) - (state at time i).\r\n```\r\nSo the underlying GPs are trained to provide delta as their output.\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/blob/fae0ea5453de548d48307bbcc9a39b439a174ce6/examples/inverted_pendulum.py#L19) how we create X and Y on the example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/405661274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nrontsis","id":4145552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDU1NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4145552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/405671107","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/11#issuecomment-405671107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/11","id":405671107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTY3MTEwNw==","user":{"login":"mcyip","id":8382274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODIyNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8382274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip","html_url":"https://github.com/mcyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcyip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-17T17:57:08Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T17:57:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
