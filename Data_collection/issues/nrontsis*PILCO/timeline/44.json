think I managed to implement it in the original Matlab version. What you can do is:\r\n- Change the linear policy from M = W*m + b to M = W*m + b * r(t) for the current timestep t (make sure this t is passed to the function). Change the policy gradient dMdp as well - its gradient w.r.t. b used to be 1, but is r(t) now. I do not believe the gradient w.r.t the variance changes. \r\nAlternatively, use another parametrization, as long as it uses r(t). \r\n- Pass the current time t to the cost function as well, use this r(t) for the immediate reward instead of a fixed x_target\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/639436652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maxvanmeer","id":9469290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer","html_url":"https://github.com/maxvanmeer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxvanmeer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
