Make sure to check out the Jupyter notebook in the examples, it has a list of troubleshooting advice and various small workarounds we used on the examples.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/496005402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2367845035,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM2Nzg0NTAzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2367845035","actor":{"login":"iljastas","id":16838960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas","html_url":"https://github.com/iljastas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-26T14:34:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2367845036,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNjc4NDUwMzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2367845036","actor":{"login":"iljastas","id":16838960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas","html_url":"https://github.com/iljastas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-26T14:34:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/496097018","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/29#issuecomment-496097018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/29","id":496097018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjA5NzAxOA==","user":{"login":"iljastas","id":16838960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas","html_url":"https://github.com/iljastas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iljastas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-27T06:39:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T06:39:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
