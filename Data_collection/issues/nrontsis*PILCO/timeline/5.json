We should investigate these further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/398580658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/398669338","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/5#issuecomment-398669338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/5","id":398669338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODY2OTMzOA==","user":{"login":"nrontsis","id":4145552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDU1NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4145552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T08:33:35Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T08:33:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Okay, that's good news.
