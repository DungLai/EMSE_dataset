I agree `eye(.)` would be more appropriate as the default value. In most cases we expect the user to define a reward relevant to the task at hand, but `eye(.)` seems more reasonable as the standard choice, and even in our examples the rewards used are diagonal. I think I initially went with `ones` for debugging purposes (many zero values could hide mistakes), but that's not relevant now.
