The sparse approximation used here (FITC, Snelson and Ghahramani) is based on inducing points (pseudoinputs for the GP, replacing the real data points). Once you get the approximation to the kernel according to the method for sparse GPs you are using (see par. 2.4, Sparse Approximations using Inducing Inputs, from M. Deisenroth's [thesis](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/13927/10/thesis_mpd_corrected.pdf) ), you can continue with the predictions as you would normally. \r\n\r\nThat is why in our code only the `calculate_factorizations` function is redefined in `SMGPR`  (performing the kernel computations and inversions), while the `predict_given_factorizations` (performing the predictions with uncertain inputs) remains the same with `MGPR`. Hope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/585280534/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3031435592,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAzMTQzNTU5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/3031435592","actor":{"login":"powertj","id":20458451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDU4NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20458451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj","html_url":"https://github.com/powertj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-12T16:08:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3031435599,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMzE0MzU1OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/3031435599","actor":{"login":"powertj","id":20458451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDU4NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20458451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj","html_url":"https://github.com/powertj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powertj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-12T16:08:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3192592553,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE5MjU5MjU1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/3192592553","actor":{"login":"nrontsis","id":4145552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDU1NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4145552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-02T14:54:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
