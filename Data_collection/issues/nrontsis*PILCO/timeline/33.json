A more general comment: I think what you are doing here is the [unscented transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unscented_transform), which is a reasonable alternative to moment matching, but it might make policy optimisation harder (in our version for the gradients of the cost w.r.t. the controller's parameters we back propagate through the moment matching equations).\r\n\r\nNow for your problem, how did you compare the sampling results to moment matching? Did you rewrite moment matching in pytorch? If so, did you test against our version? Otherwise, if you are comparing to our implementation of `predict_on_noisy_input` show us a MWE, which in this case I guess should have a small dataset and a GP model defined both in gpflow and gpytorch with the same hyperparameters. Then we should verify that on normal inputs (single points, not probabilistic) their predictions are the same and after that we'd look for a given noisy test point whether the predicted mean, variance and input-output covariance are similar (preferably with a large number of samples just to be sure).

I will definitely go check the hyperparameter settings. \r\n\r\nAn addition quick question is that, if I use a sampling approach, how does the backpropagation flow? Does it consider the sampled points as constant tensors?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/529070990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jaztsong","id":7253796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong","html_url":"https://github.com/jaztsong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaztsong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2615982077,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxNTk4MjA3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2615982077","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-07T04:20:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2615982078,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTU5ODIwNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2615982078","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-07T04:20:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/529116080","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/33#issuecomment-529116080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/33","id":529116080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTExNjA4MA==","user":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-07T15:04:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T15:04:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hey, not sure how would pytorch, or tensorflow for that matter, implement backpropagation with sampling, but yes I'd expect the samples to be constant, after all they don't change and are not optimised.
