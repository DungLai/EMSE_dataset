The most comprehensive is [Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Gaussian Processes](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/13927/10/thesis_mpd_corrected.pdf), the PhD thesis by Marc Deisenroth. \r\n\r\nThe input - output covariance, cov[x, f(x) | m, S], refers to the covariance between an input to the GP model, x, and the model's output f(x). It's needed for long term predictions, and it's used in our `pilco.propagate` function, and the corresponding Matlab function ( `pred.m` and `propagate.m`). If you want to see the math in more detail, see paragraph 2.3.3 of the thesis I linked above, with the final equation being 2.70.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/471697606/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2195088409,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5NTA4ODQwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2195088409","actor":{"login":"jastfkjg","id":30892925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODkyOTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30892925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg","html_url":"https://github.com/jastfkjg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T19:55:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2195088410,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTUwODg0MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2195088410","actor":{"login":"jastfkjg","id":30892925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODkyOTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30892925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg","html_url":"https://github.com/jastfkjg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T19:55:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2195820106,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE5NTgyMDEwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2195820106","actor":{"login":"jastfkjg","id":30892925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODkyOTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30892925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg","html_url":"https://github.com/jastfkjg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jastfkjg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-12T02:26:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2195820193,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5NTgyMDE5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2195820193","actor":{"login":"jastfkjg","id":30892925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODkyOTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercon
