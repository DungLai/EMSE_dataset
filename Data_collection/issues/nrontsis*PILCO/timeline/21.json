That makes planning with a normally distributed prediction for every time-step, as PILCO does, not that useful. What I did was change this initialisation, from the gym source code, to a starting position with the pendulum at the bottom, with a reasonably small amount of starting uncertainty (~0.1). Now this is an easier task than what the original gym one, but since the pendulum swing-up task is a standard control benchmark, we might still want to solve it this way (the version used in the original PILCO paper is like this too).\r\n\r\nNow for the memory issues, I have encountered them too, there a few things you can do, and they are related to T, the number of time-steps in the planning horizon and N, the number of runs and subsequently the number of data points you are working with.\r\n- Reduce time horizon, possibly by using subsampling. During planning, a number of matrices are created and held in memory simultaneously, proportional to the number of time steps in the planning horizon. You might want to decrease that number. If you feel a longer time horizon is needed, you can use subsampling, basically repeating each action for m time-steps, and only showing PILCO the state every m time-steps. That way you can plan ahead long enough, without the memory problems. There is a simple way to implement that by changing the rollout function in `inverted_pendulum.py`.\r\n- Use sparse GPs. By using the num_induced_points argument when you call the PILCO constructor you can set the number of data points used for the GP inference.\r\n\r\nAlso be ware that the default reward function and initial state of PILCO won't work for Pendulum-v0.
