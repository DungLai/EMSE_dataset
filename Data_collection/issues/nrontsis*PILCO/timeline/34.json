This doesn't solve your case, but it might be helpful step. \r\n\r\nA similar functionality in the original PILCO implementation allows for multiple starting states, that induce different predicted trajectories, and a single control policy is trained jointly for all cases.\r\n\r\nTo have a single policy for the distinct targets, you'd have to alter the training process in a similar way. The training is based on predicted trajectories, and the predictions are Gaussian. The extra dimension you want to introduce would have arbitrarily large initial variance, if you want to alter the targets freely. Then, the Gaussian estimate for the next state(s), would also be very uncertain, and planning would be very hard. I think the best approach would be to train on a number of distinct trajectories, corresponding to different targets. If these are reasonably representative of the possible targets, the policy trained on all of them should be able to generalise to new targets too. \r\n\r\nTo be more specific, one way to implement this, assuming the GP model from `mgpr.py` remains unchanged would be:\r\n- change the `pilco._build_likelihood` so that it combines (adding probably) multiple predicted rewards, one for each predicted trajectory with its corresponding target\r\n- you would need different reward functions, with different targets (either different instances of the rewards we currently have or a new reward class)\r\n- a controller class that doesn't just take the state as input but the target also, as you suggested.\r\nI am pretty sure that other smaller changes will be needed as you go along with the implementation.\r\n\r\nBy the way, a good simple case study for this would be the openAI gym Reacher-v2, where a simple robotic arm has to reach a specific target with its end point, and the target varies from episode to episode. It should be a nice minimal example of the functionality you are looking for.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in this and will probably try a few things in the next few weeks, keep me posted if you make any progress, and I will mention this issue in any relevant commits. Good luck and have fun!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/536192536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2670578363,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY3MDU3ODM2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2670578363","actor":{"login":"ManuelM95","id":54777807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Nzc3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54777807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95","html_url":"https://github.com/ManuelM95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-28T14:01:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2670578365,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NzA1NzgzNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2670578365","actor":{"login":"ManuelM95","id":54777807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Nzc3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54777807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95","html_url":"https://github.com/ManuelM95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-28T14:01:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/536212909","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/34#issuecomment-536212909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/34","id":536212909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjIxMjkwOQ==","user":{"login":"ManuelM95","id":54777807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Nzc3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54777807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95","html_url":"https://github.com/ManuelM95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ManuelM95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-28T18:18:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-28T18:18:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
