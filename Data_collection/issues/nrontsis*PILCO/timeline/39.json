GPs keeps all the data in memory that will then be used to do a prediction. The more you run pilco the more samples will be collected and thus the prediction time will increase. If your familiar with the big O notation, gp prediction time is O(n^3) where n is the number of samples. There is some research going on to reduce this ( sparse gaussians etc) but in the overall, the more samples you have, the longer the policy optimization will be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/587448539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NicolayP","id":24211531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjExNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24211531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP","html_url":"https://github.com/NicolayP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolayP/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/587493268","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/39#issuecomment-587493268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/39","id":587493268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NzQ5MzI2OA==","user":{"login":"nrontsis","id":4145552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDU1NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4145552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrontsis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-18T14:42:20Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T14:42:20Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I think I agree with @NicolayP.
