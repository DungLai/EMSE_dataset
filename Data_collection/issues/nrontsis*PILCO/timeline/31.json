They arise usually in the backward pass (when calculating gradients), where big matrices, order N^2D^2 with N the number of data points and D the number of dimensions are involved.  \r\n\r\nYou could try something like reducing the number of data points used in the test, (it's a 100 and it's \r\nhard coded, you'd have to change it in a few places) just to make sure it's not because of the demands of the algorithm. Excluding that would point to an issue with GPflow or CUDA (or tensorflow) and how they handle resources on your machine, but I wouldn't really know how to address that.
