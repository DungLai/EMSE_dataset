There is always the chance that learning will diverge, but in these examples and with the chosen parameters, performance has been consistently good. I'll rerun some of these, I'll try another system too.\r\n\r\nCould you share some details about your system, tf and gpflow versions etc?\r\n\r\nSome things to check if you want: \r\nCan you replicate the problem ? \r\nDoes it persist across random seeds (the random seed shouldn't be an issue but...) ? \r\nDid PILCO get a reasonable solution on any of the previous episodes and diverged eventually or did it never get off?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/479534227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kyr-pol","id":17572944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17572944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol","html_url":"https://github.com/kyr-pol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyr-pol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2250204653,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI1MDIwNDY1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2250204653","actor":{"login":"JoeMWatson","id":11985625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg1NjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11985625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoeMWatson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-03T15:16:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2250204654,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNTAyMDQ2NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/events/2250204654","actor":{"login":"JoeMWatson","id":11985625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg1NjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11985625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoeMWatson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-03T15:16:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/comments/481697355","html_url":"https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/26#issuecomment-481697355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrontsis/PILCO/issues/26","id":481697355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTY5NzM1NQ==","user":{"login":"JoeMWatson","id":11985625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg1NjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11985625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoeMWatson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoeMWatson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T13:45:52Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T13:45:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Upon
