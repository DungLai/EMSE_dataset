First of all I take no credit for the article which is linked to. I used it myself for inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe program does not take into account advertisements in the subtitles. That would be a great addition. Since voice activity detection and not voice recognition is used, yes, the program is able to synchronise your subtitle even though it is different from the spoken language.\r\n\r\nI created the tool as a standalone. Using *subliminal* and *subsync* together would be great. I suggest you use both as libraries in a simple python script you can write up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/comments/450041825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tympanix","id":9674814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NzQ4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9674814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2045133166,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA0NTEzMzE2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/events/2045133166","actor":{"login":"tympanix","id":9674814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NzQ4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9674814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-26T23:41:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/comments/450042012","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix/subsync/issues/7#issuecomment-450042012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/7","id":450042012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDA0MjAxMg==","user":{"login":"tympanix","id":9674814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NzQ4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9674814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-26T23:43:55Z","updated_at":"2018-12-26T23:43:55Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I have created #8 for the purpose of removing advertisements etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/comments/450042012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tympanix","id":9674814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NzQ4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9674814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
