I myself had to downgrade tensorflow to v1.5.1 - and in fact that is what subsync is using. You may try to clone the project, create a virtual python environment and test with different versions of tensorflow. You can read additional information here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/17411.

one movie and the subtitles are badly offset, it cannot repair it, tried alot settings increased alot duration and margins. anyways it was badly offset  so no wonder it was not able do it :D\r\nAlso tried a serie it however managed to ajust about in the middle of it, but end  was offset. \r\n\r\nMaybe implement at some point 2-point sync, like timeajuster.  then it should work when sync on start and at the end. \r\nAlready love this :) this saves alot time not manually ajust
