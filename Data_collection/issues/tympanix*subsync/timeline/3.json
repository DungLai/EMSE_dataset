When I get errors it seems to be because the input .srt is UTF-8 already.  A quick sanity check in my shell verifies this sort of situation would lead to the same problem I'm seeing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo 'Bon appétit' | iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8\r\nBon appÃ©tit\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the best way to solve this, but I can think of three:\r\n1. Make utf-8 the default, and point out in the README that input .srt files must be utf-8 encoded.\r\n2. Allow specifying the input encoding with a command line argument, with a sensible default (utf-8?).\r\n3. Detect the input encoding. I've had some success with [enca](https://github.com/nijel/enca), but I'm not sure any automatic detection method can be considered 100% reliable.\r\n\r\nP.S. thanks for creating and sharing this!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/comments/417457839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zship","id":151098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship","html_url":"https://github.com/zship","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zship/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/comments/417510715","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix/subsync/issues/3#issuecomment-417510715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/3","id":417510715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzUxMDcxNQ==","user":{"login":"tympanix","id":9674814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NzQ4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9674814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-31T00:28:15Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T00:28:15Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Glad you found it useful.
