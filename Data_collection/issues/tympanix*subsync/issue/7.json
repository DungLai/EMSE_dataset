Very interesting, for someone with very basic ML knowledge it was very interesting to learn of the additional metrics for log-loss etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was trying to automate subtitle retrieval and syncing for my own native language. Often I can get subtitles in my own language, but they do not line up at all. Is it possible to sync subtitles in another language, than what is spoken in the media file?\r\n\r\nAlso, does this take into account that sometimes subtitles have advertisements in their subtitles, e.g. feeding false information?\r\n\r\nEdit: perhaps it's a good idea to create a wrapper that uses both https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal to download and subsync to align each subtitle. That would be a killer solution. AFAIK there is no proper subtitle solution available.","closed_by":{"login":"tympanix","id":9674814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NzQ4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9674814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix","html_url":"https://github.com/tympanix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tympanix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tympanix/subsync/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
