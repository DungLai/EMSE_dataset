I tried `ssa_L1_100d_lstm3x512_lm_i512_mb64_tau0.5_p0.05_epoch100.sav` , but it appears to process only ~ 1 sequence per minute on top end CPU (no cuda).  If i understand correctly, sequences should just be passed through the network to get the embeddings, i.e. a fast operation.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Should I use other pre-trained models?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMartin   \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tbepler","id":5326126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjYxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler","html_url":"https://github.com/tbepler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
