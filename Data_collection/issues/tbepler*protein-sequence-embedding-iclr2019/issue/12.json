And thanks for putting the code + weights + datasets out there.\r\n\r\nI'm sort of surprised that the topology prediction is competitive with TOPCONS, yet the secondary structure prediction seems pretty far behind other methods. \r\n\r\nJohansen uses a biRNN-CRF which is similar to the one you use, right: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3107411.3107489, but they see much better predictive performance.
