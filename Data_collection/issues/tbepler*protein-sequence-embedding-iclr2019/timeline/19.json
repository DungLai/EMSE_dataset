Thanks for sharing the code, datasets and models!\r\n\r\nAny idea on what might be happening here? I am facing the same problem when trying to reproduce the similarity results reported in the paper. I run \"eval_similarity.py\" with the provided SSA models (full and without contact prediction) and test datasets (2.06-test and 2.07-new). The obtained results present exactly the same performance drop as the ones reported by @DaHaiHuha (using PyTorch version 1.2.0).\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any kind of help!
