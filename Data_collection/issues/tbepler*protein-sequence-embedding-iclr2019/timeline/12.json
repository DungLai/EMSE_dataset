The secondary structure prediction model is extremely simple, predicting the secondary structure _only from the embedding at that position_. There is no CRF, CNN, RNN, etc. component that would incorporate additional sequence context or secondary structure transition probabilities.\r\n\r\nI haven't done any benchmarks with more sophisticated decoders, but using one is likely to give competitive performance. For example, using the embeddings as features for the model you cite.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/comments/546651882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tbepler","id":5326126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjYxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler","html_url":"https://github.com/tbepler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/comments/546652099","html_url":"https://github.com/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/12#issuecomment-546652099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/12","id":546652099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjY1MjA5OQ==","user":{"login":"smsaladi","id":2942215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDIyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2942215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi","html_url":"https://github.com/smsaladi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smsaladi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-27T00:53:26Z","updated_at":"2019-10-27T00:53:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah I see.
