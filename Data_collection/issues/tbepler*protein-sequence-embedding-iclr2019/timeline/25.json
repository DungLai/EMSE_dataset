The code will run much faster.\r\n\r\nFor the embedding model, I suggest using the lambda0.1 model, but it won't change the runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/comments/793595570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tbepler","id":5326126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjYxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler","html_url":"https://github.com/tbepler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/comments/815126614","html_url":"https://github.com/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/25#issuecomment-815126614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/25","id":815126614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNTEyNjYxNA==","user":{"login":"mstrazar","id":5073833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzM4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5073833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar","html_url":"https://github.com/mstrazar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstrazar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T18:23:01Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T18:23:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just to confirm, a GPU machine and lambda0.1 model crank out 300 sequences per minute.
