The Bi-LSTM model naturally handles sequences of arbitrary length and memory consumption scales linearly with sequence length so this shouldn't be an issue even with long proteins.\r\n\r\nIf you're referring specifically to the pretrained language model component, it conditions on all previous sequence, so it's likely to perform better if shown all 1,663 amino acids when predicting the final amino acid. You could show the model a smaller context window (i.e. by feeding only the previous N amino acids the model), but it may hurt performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/comments/476407803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tbepler","id":5326126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjYxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler","html_url":"https://github.com/tbepler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2234447843,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIzNDQ0Nzg0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tbepler/protein-sequence-embedding-iclr2019/issues/events/2234447843","actor":{"login":"tbepler","id":5326126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjYxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler","html_url":"https://github.com/tbepler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbepler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-27T20:43:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
