Nice to see people working on it and publishing their code open source.\r\n\r\nSecondly: I would like to encourage you to verify your results on different datasets.\r\nSo far the biggest problem in sleep research is not to find an algorithm that works well on sleep-edfx but one that works 'in the wild'. This can only be verified by running on different datasets as well.\r\n(The Sleep-EDFx is a very old dataset and absolutely overused, creating a bias in itself in AI/Sleep-research.)\r\n\r\nFor some data set suggenstions see https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer#appendix-sleep-datasets ,  some of them are easily available, for others you need to apply (but should not be difficult)\r\n\r\nAs a further step, if testing on other data sets reveals a good generalization, I encourage you to publish some pre-trained weights. This way those could be included in open-source sleep software such as [visbrain](https://github.com/EtienneCmb/visbrain)","closed_by":{"login":"MousaviSajad","id":16269257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjY5MjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16269257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad","html_url":"https://github.com/MousaviSajad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MousaviSajad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MousaviSajad/SleepEEGNet/issues/1/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MousaviSajad/SleepEEGNet/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
