After digging through your repo, you're calling `create_train_env()` in `src/env.py` For Atari environments, breakout/pong/space-force, the observation space is (210, 160, 3). This means that you're picking up 210 frames before training the actual agent.\r\nDoesn't this result in huge training error initially, since the number of channels is significantly larger than most A3C papers indicate, maybe like 2 or 3?\r\nWhat's your justification towards such high of a channel number?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uvipen/Super-mario-bros-A3C-pytorch/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uvipen/Super-mario-bros-A3C-pytorch/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
