Apologies if not.\r\n\r\nSo I created a very simple test.do file with just the above code to see how everything works. The first time i press CTRL+Enter some kind of initialization happens and some commands get executed in stata (`cd \".do File Directory\"`; `set more on`; etc.). However, from every command (except the first one) the first letter is missing (`et more on`; `et pagesize 100`; etc).\r\n\r\n#### Expected Output\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\n#### Debugging log\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using `console` mode, there should be a file named\r\n~/.stata_kernel_cache/console_debug.log. This is helpful to see for debugging\r\ninformation. Note that this has all the commands and output up to where the\r\nprogram crashed.\r\n -->\r\n\r\nI didn't find this.\r\n\r\n#### Package Version\r\n\r\n<!-- You can find the package version with `pip show stata_kernel` -->\r\n\r\n1.4.1\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\nStata 13.0, MP-64\r\n\r\n(I had to install the package by manually setting the `stata_path` in` install.py`. Don't know if this causes the problem. Seems unlikely.)\r\n\r\n#### Received Output\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17196288/45001653-3e1d5180-afcf-11e8-85d3-0f6bbdc85720.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
