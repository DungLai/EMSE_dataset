So when the user sends `mata`, it tries to open a log, run `mata`, and close the log. This doesn't work for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nI think it should be possible to use a _single_ log file that stays open for the _entire_ session.\r\n\r\nWhen I do \r\n```stata\r\nlog using test.log\r\ndi 1\r\n```\r\nand `tail -f test.log` in Git bash on Windows, I'm able to read text in a stream as it's written to the file.\r\n\r\nAs long as my timing between Python and Windows is accurate and I know when Stata is free, (using `UtilIsStataFree`), this should be possible to read into Python as a stream. I've never worked with a streaming text file but it should be fun to test out.
