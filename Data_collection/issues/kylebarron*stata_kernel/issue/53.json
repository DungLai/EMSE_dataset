Please describe.**\r\nKeyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) should be supported whenever possible. In the console version of Stata this is akin to hitting the \"break\" button. This is generally useful but would also help with a common mistake (that at least I make): Sometimes I put a command that would have Stata printing stuff to the console for several minutes, and Ctrl+C is very helpful to break that.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe following works for me in `run_shell` but I haven't tested it too thoroughly.\r\n```python\r\nfor line in lines:\r\n    try:\r\n        self.child.sendline(line)\r\n        self.child.expect('(?<=(\\r\\n)|(\\x1b=))\\r\\n\\.
