The commands work in a Stata instance, but it appears that the kernel's Stata instance does not recognize `odbc list`.  I get the standard error related to missing ODBC drivers. \r\n\r\n`The ODBC file libiodbc.dylib could not be found on this system.\r\nSetting the unix LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable may correct this error.`\r\n\r\nI would not call this a bug because I continue to ask myself why I keep using Stata + SQL (it is difficult to set up with Stata on its own).  How to replicate:\r\n\r\n- create a new notebook with a single code block `odbc list`\r\n- open Stata and run `odbc list`\r\n\r\nIs there a configuration in the kernel that ensures it sees the odbc databases available on the system in the way that Stata sees?  i.e. how can I get `odbc list` to return the correct list?
