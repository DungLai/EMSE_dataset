I've installed Atom few month ago to learn python. And now for my new studies, I have to work with Stata. I've see that it's possible to use atom as a do-file for stata. \r\nI've installed **language stata** and **hydrogen** packages as it's explain [here](https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/using_jupyter/atom/). Atom recognize the language but the run command (crtl-enter) dosen't work. An error message come :\r\n_\"No kernel for grammar Stata found\r\nCheck that the language for this file is set in Atom, that you have a Jupyter kernel installed for it, and that you have configured the language mapping in Hydrogen preferences.\"_\r\n\r\nCan anybody help me to write the correct language mapping?\r\n\r\nAtom is really good but without the run command that's not useful for me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your answers.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
