Is there currently a way to use python in select instances whilst using `stata_kernel`? For example, when using `ipystata` in a Python3 kernel, it is possible to use the `%%stata` magic to use a stata command in a particular cell? I know the SoS notebook exists for multiple language noteboks, but if there was an inbuilt magic in the kernel so that graphs could be built by seaborn in Python, for example, that would be a much better workflow when the majority of the analysis is completed in stata.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCallum\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
