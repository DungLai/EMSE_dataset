So a tabular environment might look weird in Jupyter Notebook, but then look normal inside the PDF export:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the right way to implement this. Maybe have a magic like `%%latex` that tells the kernel that the output should be treated as raw latex. Note, however, that `%%latex` is what IPython uses for raw latex [_input_, not _output_](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Rich%20Output.ipynb#LaTeX). \r\n\r\nI don't think there's going to be any way for the kernel to know when the text output is LaTeX; I think there should be some manual setting.\r\n\r\nNotebook:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15164633/45577429-e9d56580-b849-11e8-8070-6b05abc76acf.png)\r\n\r\nPDF export:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15164633/45577415-dfb36700-b849-11e8-97eb-6d4d382c9dc5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
