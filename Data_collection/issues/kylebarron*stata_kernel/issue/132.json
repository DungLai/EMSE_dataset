I am using version 1.4.3., which I downloaded today (first time using it).  I have looked at it both in Atom and Jupyter Notebooks.  I can get a few lines to run, and then will start getting an error message like:\r\n\r\n. c4869c9c119320f7af8a3981776720'\r\ncommand c4869c9c119320f7af8a3981776720 is unrecognized\r\n( )\r\nr(199);\r\n\r\nCommands will still run, although they will halt on that line, so that for example \"display 2+2\" in Atom produces:\r\n\r\n. c4869c9c119320f7af8a3981776720'\r\ncommand c4869c9c119320f7af8a3981776720 is unrecognized\r\n4\r\nr(199);\r\n\r\nOnce I start getting this error (which happens within a few commands), I don't un-start getting it.  In Jupyter, I was able to start fresh by resetting the kernel, but I don't know how to do that in Atom (and, in any event, would only work for a few lines).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
