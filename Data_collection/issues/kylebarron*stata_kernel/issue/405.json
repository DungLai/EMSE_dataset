The stata_kernel uses the same `include.do` file in the `cache_dir` directory for both sessions. This leads to a race condition between sessions in writing to and reading/executing from `include.do`.\r\n\r\nThe effect is intermittent, seemingly inexplicable Stata errors resulting from Stata executing code run from a different session.\r\n\r\n#### Code Sample\r\nTo reproduce, run multiple simultaneous sessions. Easiest to reproduce when the notebooks for each session have multiple cells that may start near-simultaneously.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Output\r\nNo Stata errors.\r\n\r\n#### Other information\r\n- OS: RHEL 7, RHEL 8\r\n- Stata: 16.0mp8c\r\n- stata-kernel: 1.12.2","closed_by":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
