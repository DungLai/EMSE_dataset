Please describe.**\r\nCurrently the documentation (and error that is shown in `install.py` when the `stata_path` is not found) make it seem like manually adding the path to the config file will then make the install script read this path when trying to install again.\r\n\r\nThis is however not the case. The installer will even overwrite the manually changed config file when running it again.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'm not sure what the intended behavior here is. But to me (reading the documentation) what I would expect and what would make sense is if `_find_path()` went something like this:\r\n```\r\n    ...\r\n        if fpath:\r\n                break\r\n\r\n    if fpath == '':\r\n        (read path from config)\r\n    return fpath\r\n```\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nChange the documentation to represent the current behavior.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
