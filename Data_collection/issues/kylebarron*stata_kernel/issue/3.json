I will try this kernel out on my Linux workstation soon and let you know if I run into any issues. \r\n\r\nI have been doing a little bit of research into Windows support but it seems that the Windows version does not have an interactive console mode (only the full GUI version or the console batch mode). It does appear that it is possible to install Stata without GUI, but I have not been able to get this to work yet (e.g. https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/windows/install-from-command-line/). \r\n\r\nAnother option would be to include Stata Automation integration for Windows users (like I did with ipystata). I can probably add this for you once I get back from holiday in a couple of weeks. \r\n\r\nI will also definitely consider adding similar Linux (and MacOS) functionality into ipystata, by the looks of it this approach using `pexpect` seems to work nicely.
