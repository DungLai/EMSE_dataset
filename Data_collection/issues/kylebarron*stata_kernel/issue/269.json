After that, I'll almost certainly transition into a non-Econ job, and won't even have access to Stata.\r\n\r\nEven in January-March, I'll have relatively little free time as I'll be heavily planning for the trail. My main goal for the short term then, is to make the program as stable as possible. I'm looking at:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Adding lots of tests\r\n- [x] Adding more documentation, especially creating an example Jupyter Notebook or two to show in the repository\r\n- [ ] Possibly trying to fix the big linesize issue (#216, #177, #151). The core of this is that I search for the path of where the graph is saved to show a graph, but when the linesize is small and the path to the cache directory is long, it wraps lines and I don't catch the entire path.\r\n\r\nLooking at the long term, I've already given @mcaceresb  write access to the repository. Especially after March, feel free (with no obligation) to improve the project however you see fit, including adding other contributors. I've written some [contributor documentation](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md); do let me know if there's something you want me to add.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
