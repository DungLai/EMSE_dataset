Please see the [sos documentation on Stata](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/doc/documentation/Supported_Languages.html#Stata--19) if you are interested.\r\n\r\nRight now sos only allows the exchange of \"current dataset\" with Stata because I do not know how \"variables\" work in Stata. It also only reports `version` as `%sessioninfo` because I do not know if there are other session-related information to report (e.g. version of Stata libraries). Anyway, the module seems to work all right and please feel free to let me know if you have any comment.","closed_by":{"login":"BoPeng","id":9889312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODkzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9889312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng","html_url":"https://github.com/BoPeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoPeng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/255/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
