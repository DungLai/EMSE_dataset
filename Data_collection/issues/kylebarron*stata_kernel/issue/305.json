To be more precise:\r\n- I have a working Stata 13 installation under Windows 10 1803\r\n- I have an Ubuntu WSL distribution installed which contains my entire developer setup\r\nAs I want to use my unix environment for coding, I wanted to integrate my Stata into that and stata_kernel is particularly nice for that. I have an additional full Jupyter Lab stack under Windows which works perfect with Stata. So it seems everything under Windows is properly setup.\r\nNow, when I start a Jupyter Lab server inside WSL, the stata Kernel does not seem to work. For the stack trace see below. It seems that pexpect is not properly invoking the stata session. If I run a Stata command manually it works, e.g.\r\n```\r\n/PATH/TO/STATA/StataMP-64.exe /b /PATH/TO/SOME/file.do\r\n```\r\nThe do-file is properly executed and a corresponding file.log is created which contains the entire and correct stata output.\r\nAdditionally, when the stata kernel starts, a blank instance of Stata opens which is doing nothing (no file executed).\r\n\r\nI know the setup sounds rather particular, but I am absolutely unwilling to code under Windows and switching between different environments is rather tedious. I would appreciate any help.\r\n\r\n[stata_kernel_stacktrace_20190508.log](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/files/3157467/stata_kernel_stacktrace_20190508.log)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/305/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
