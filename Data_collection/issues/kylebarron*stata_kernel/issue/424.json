Take these as suggestions to be discussed\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade for upgrading syntax to 3.6+ or newer\r\n- https://github.com/psf/black for formatting. Not a requirement but I think black is the most popular formatter in Python today https://github.com/psf/black#used-by\r\n- https://github.com/PyCQA/isort for deterministic ordering of imports\r\n- https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ for static typing. I've become a _huge_ proponent of static typing for being able to quickly understand code (especially old code you haven't looked at for a while)\r\n- Using [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) instead of argparse. IMO click is so easy to work with, and a small enough dependency, that it's a better choice.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
