I can use python's powerful data  functions and stata's powerful statistical functions at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut there is a problem, that is, whenever I use jupyterlab to create a new stata notebook, execute the stata command, and finally close the stata notebook, **but jupyter will not automatically close the stata process**, I have to enter the Windows task window every time, and manually close the stata process, which makes me Very convenient. Is there a way to fix this?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
