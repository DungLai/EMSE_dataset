The indicator in the bottom of Atom tells me that Stata is idle despite the fact that there should be more do files to execute. Opening each do file and running the code inside works fine, as does running the master do file in an instance of Stata directly.\r\n\r\nIn a perhaps related note, the first do file displays the log close and data signature set output that concludes the file while the second do file (after which the subsequent do files contained in the master do file do not run) does not, despite containing the same ending lines of code.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to work best when I run code line-by-line but selecting a section of code and running it often results in less informative output (some output that is displayed when run line-by-line does not seem to be displayed when part of a larger selection of code that is executed). \r\n\r\nKeep up the great work.
