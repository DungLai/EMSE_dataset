Please describe.**\r\nI installed stata_kernel in a JupyterHub environment using `python -m stata_kernel.install --sys-prefix`. This makes the kernel available for everyone but there is no site-wide stata_kernel.conf. The kernel will error unless every user runs `python -m stata_kernel.install` on their own.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nstata_kernel would not require a configuration file. It would use safe defaults, e.g. wouldn't require an explicit path to stata and assumes the Jupyter notebook process can find stata or stata-mp in PATH.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nstata_kernel could check for, and use, a site-wide configuration file whose values are overridden by a user's own, if it exists. This is installed when --sys-prefix is passed to install. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
