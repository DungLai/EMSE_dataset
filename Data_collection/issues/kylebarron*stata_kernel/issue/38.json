With my current code joining method, I was thinking there would be two different Token types, `Token.Text` and `Token.MatchingBracket.Other`, where the latter is a contiguous set of tokens that comprise a block (and which thus must be sent all at once). \r\n\r\nObviously I forgot that I had also defined the token type `Token.Literal.String`. Since this is a different name than the earlier two token types, the loop parsed it into a different line.\r\n\r\nI need to leave the string token type so that it catches comments, and also within blocks:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15164633/43841838-0d476da8-9af2-11e8-81fa-083f653ae1e1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the part where it's superbly annoying that there isn't a way with Pygments to show the entire token stack. It only shows the topmost token, so I can't see (I don't think) that above the `Token.Literal.String.Double` is inside a `Token.MatchingBracket.Other`. \r\n\r\nI think the main way to solve this is to set the token name for strings that occur within a block to `Token.MatchingBracket.Other`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
