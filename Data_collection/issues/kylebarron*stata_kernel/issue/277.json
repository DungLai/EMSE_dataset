The output and highlighting of standard plotting commands (e.g. scatter) works fine. \r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n\tsysuse auto\r\n\tscatter price mpg\r\n``` \r\nresults in the expected plot. Changing `scatter` to `binscatter` doesn't work. Writing the same thing in a standard Stata window does work. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have upgraded `stata_kernel` to the latest version. \r\nI have experienced this both on Atom and Jupyter Lab. \r\nNo error is showing up.
