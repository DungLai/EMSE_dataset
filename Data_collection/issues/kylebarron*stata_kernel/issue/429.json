The kernel can be restarted, but goes straight back to just loading and loading.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be the issue?\r\n\r\nI am using VS Code for my .ipynb notebook files.\r\n\r\n(No log)\r\n\r\n#### Expected Output\r\n```stata\r\n(1978 automobile data)\r\n```\r\n#### Other information\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 Pro (64-bit)\r\n- Stata 17 MP (2-core)\r\n- stata_kernel (1.12.2)\r\n- Visual Studio Code (1.71.2)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Code_3OGg2at3Mp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88621816/190912794-e323215e-013d-4ab1-9c4e-5ae7066f7d8e.gif)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/429/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
