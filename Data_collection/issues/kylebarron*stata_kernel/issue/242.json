I checked and it seems like the registry key in `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Stata15...` is missing. Nonetheless, this should be fixable by editing `.stata_kernel.conf` file. I tried:\r\n\r\n    stata_path = C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15\\StataMP-64.exe\r\n\r\nThis is the same directory as another machine that could run `stata_kernel`.
