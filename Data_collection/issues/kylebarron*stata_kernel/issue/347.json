Maybe it is, but it wasn't clear.\r\n\r\nThese are the EXTRA steps you need to take (i.e., you NEED to do the make shortcut, /register, etc.; but if you do that and get \"stata_path option...\" then try this):\r\n\r\n1) Navigate to your personal folder: typically C:\\Users\\USERNAME (username is your username, so if your name is \"statamcstataface\" the directory would be C:\\Users\\statamcstataface)\r\n\r\n2. Download the attached file (.stata_kernel.conf.txt) to your personal folder. \r\n[.stata_kernel.conf.txt](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/files/4593625/default.stata_kernel.conf.txt)\r\n\r\n3. Open the file.  On line two, rename the stata_path section - where it says [Insert the correct directory here] to the correct address of your STATA installation folder (make sure to delete the [ and ] as well).  I'm running StataMP-64, change that the StataSE if that's what your system is using.\r\n\r\n4. Save as, and remove the \".txt\" ending.  \r\n\r\nThe final name of the file should be .stata_kernel.conf and line two of said file should be your Stata installation folder. Then run \"python -m stata_kernel.install\" again. Hope it works for you, took me hours to figure out the problem.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to download random files, here's the contents. Just make a new .txt file in your personal folder and paste it in:\r\n\r\n[stata_kernel]\r\nstata_path = \"C:\\Program Files\\[Insert the correct directory here]\\StataMP-64.exe\"\r\nexecution_mode = automation\r\ncache_directory = ~/.stata_kernel_cache\r\nautocomplete_closing_symbol = False\r\ngraph_format = svg\r\ngraph_scale = 1\r\nuser_graph_keywords = coefplot,vioplot\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/347/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
