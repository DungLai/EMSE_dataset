Please describe.**\r\nOn a fresh (Linux) install Stata Kernel dies due to libtinfo.so.5 be missing in my system.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nncurses 6 (current version) is backwards compatible with ncurses 5. It'd be nice if libtinfo.so.6 is called instead.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA symlink works just fine if libtinfo.so.5 isn't present but libtinfo.so.6 is, but this is rather a lazy approach (?) Of course, installing ncurses 5 is yet another alternative, but since they are backwards compatible...\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNot really sure how many Linux systems pack ncurses 5. In my case (Arch) there is an AUR package but the official package is ncurses 6. I am not sure either if this is a \"problem\" specific to Stata Kernel. I found it when doing a fresh install and thought it might be worth sharing since a Google search didn't yield much.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
