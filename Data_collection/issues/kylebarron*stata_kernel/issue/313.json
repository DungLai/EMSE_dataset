I believe I know the cause of the problem: The first time I began using stata-kernel, I had a version of both Stata MP and Stata SE installed on my drive. I no longer have a license to use MP, so I now only use SE. It seems like stata_kernel was trying to run the code in Stata MP, which I have no license for. I uninstalled MP to see if this fixes the problem, but it still continues to look for Stata MP, as you can see in the last line of the traceback below. I'm not sure how to change the default version of Stata which stata-kernel looks for. I have uninstalled and reinstalled hydrogen and stata_kernel, but I still get the same error. Do you know how I can fix this? I have MacOS 10.14.6, Stata SE 16, and stata-kernel 1.10.5. The traceback is below. Thanks so much.\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/runpy.py\", line 193, in _run_module_as_main \"main\", mod_spec) File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/runpy.py\", line 85, in _run_code exec(code, run_globals) File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/stata_kernel/main.py\", line 4, in IPKernelApp.launch_instance(kernel_class=StataKernel) File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/traitlets/config/application.py\", line 657, in launch_instance app.initialize(argv) File \"</Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/decorator.py:decorator-gen-124>\", line 2, in initialize File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/traitlets/config/application.py\", line 87, in catch_config_error return method(app, args, **kwargs) File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ipykernel/kernelapp.py\", line 484, in initialize self.init_kernel() File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ipykernel/kernelapp.py\", line 389, in init_kernel user_ns=self.user_ns, File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/traitlets/config/configurable.py\", line 412, in instance inst = cls(args, **kwargs) File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/stata_kernel/kernel.py\", line 73, in init self.stata = StataSession(self, self.conf) File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/stata_kernel/stata_session.py\", line 91, in init self.init_console() File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/stata_kernel/stata_session.py\", line 179, in init_console codec_errors='replace') File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pexpect/pty_spawn.py\", line 204, in init self._spawn(command, args, preexec_fn, dimensions) File \"/Users/robbiedulin/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pexpect/pty_spawn.py\", line 276, in _spawn 'executable: %s.' % self.command) pexpect.exceptions.ExceptionPexpect: The command was not found or was not executable: /Applications/Stata/StataMP.app/Contents/MacOS/stata-mp.","closed_by":{"login":"robbiediv","id":55147315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTQ3MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55147315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv","html_url":"https://github.com/robbiediv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbiediv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
