This is what the kernel does whenever I call `scatter`\r\n`noi gr export /home/viktor/.stata_kernel_cache/graph${stata_kernel_graph_counter}.svg, width(600) replace`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nI would expect that graphs are stored within the `ipynb` file itself. This used to be case with `ipystata`. If not, at least there should be notebook-specific folders containing the corresponding graphs and not a common `cache` folder where graphs get replaced once the counter resets.\r\n\r\n#### Other information\r\n- Ubuntu 18.10\r\n- Stata MP 14.2\r\n- Package version: 1.5.x but after upgrading to 1.10.5, the behavior is still the same\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"v-marinkov","id":7135724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzU3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7135724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov","html_url":"https://github.com/v-marinkov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-marinkov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
