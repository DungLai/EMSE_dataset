Unit tests (via `pytest`) are additionally failing. The issue seems to be that python packages have changed slightly over the years (rather than any fundamental problem with the kernel itself). I tried to update the dependencies and discovered it wasn't particularly simple, hence this issue.\r\n\r\n#### Other information\r\n\r\nSee, for example, #404, #413 (and possibly #409).\r\n\r\nNB: Given this wasn't a simple task I may not get to it for some time unless it proves to be a serious issue.\r\n\r\n#### TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check tests in other OSs.\r\n- [ ] Check rest of tests.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
