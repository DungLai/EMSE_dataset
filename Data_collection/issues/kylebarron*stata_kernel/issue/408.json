Instead, I only get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfile ~/.stata_kernel_cache/graph0.svg saved as SVG format\r\nfile ~/.stata_kernel_cache/graph0.pdf saved as PDF format\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem is persistent with default commands (e.g. `twoway`) and  third-party packages (e.g. `coefplot`). Changing the kernel's graph format and redundancy also does not fix the issue. \r\n\r\n#### Other information\r\n\r\n- MacOS 12.0.1\r\n- Stata 17.0\r\n- Stata Kernel  1.12.2","closed_by":{"login":"daniel-alves-fernandes","id":74274176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Mjc0MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74274176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes","html_url":"https://github.com/daniel-alves-fernandes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniel-alves-fernandes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/408/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
