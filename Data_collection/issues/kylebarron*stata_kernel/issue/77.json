If someone loads a 1 million row dataset and types `list`, 1 million rows of the data will be printed on the screen or until the user `KeyboardInterrupt`s. This is probably undesirable, as some users won't know to `Ctrl-C`, and it's slightly different on Hydrogen and Jupyter Notebook.\r\n\r\nSo probably set `set more 10` or something at the beginning, and then also `expect` for `\\r\\n--more--`. Then if you hit that, automatically press `q` and tell user that output was shortened by `more`.\r\n\r\nNote that `set more 1` doesn't work for shell commands. `!yes` runs forever.","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/77/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/77/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
