This is the `repr` of the result of `reg price mpg` on Windows. The two characters after this segment of text is `\\r\\n`, but each line of the regression results is ended just by `\\n`. The `eol` entry in `expect` is `r'\\r?\\n'`, but apparently the pexpect buffer is large enough that it finds the ending `\\r\\n` before the intermediate `\\n`s. \r\n\r\n```\r\n'      Source |       SS           df       MS      Number of obs   =        74\\n-------------+----------------------------------   F(1, 72)        =     20.26\\n       Model |   139449474         1   139449474   Prob > F        =    0.0000\\n    Residual |   495615923        72  6883554.48   R-squared       =    0.2196\\n-------------+----------------------------------   Adj R-squared   =    0.2087\\n       Total |   635065396        73  8699525.97   Root MSE        =    2623.7\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       price |      Coef.
