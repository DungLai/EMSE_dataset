During this time the dot next to Stata is full and says kernel is connected. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29275622/102888208-97d40f00-4458-11eb-8789-70ae09fe4914.png)\r\n\r\nWhen the dot center turns white then all seems good and fast.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29275622/102889296-b4714680-445a-11eb-8d59-5fa053481494.png)\r\n\r\nStarting Stata from the console is instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAny hints on where to look at why it takes us so long to have a responding stata-kernel ?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nArnaud Atoch\r\n\r\n#### Debugging log\r\n\r\n[console_debug.txt](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/files/5729861/console_debug.txt)\r\n\r\n**NOTE: This file includes a history of your session.
