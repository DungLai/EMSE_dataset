This started happening after my computer ran out of hard disk space and STATA started throwing an error message. I deleted some unrelated files and cleared some space. That error disappeared, but now this error keeps popping up. I've updated the kernel, I're restarted everything many times and the problem is persistent. \r\n\r\nOnly the most simple commands execute without a problem. I cannot use quietly, noisily or capture either without this error. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45105185/93109968-b15c0280-f682-11ea-9c11-d30152787516.png)\r\n\r\nThere are no such problem when I launch STATA and use it directly. \r\n\r\n#### Debugging log\r\n\r\nSee attached. \r\n[console_debug.log](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/files/5219692/console_debug.log)\r\n\r\nLooking at it, it seems like a problem with include.do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. `acf5410dffcb668adf37da696e87d400'\r\n. _StataKernelLog on\r\n\r\n. `d450cfde56d6cad2042c8f0870cc76f5'\r\n. include C:/Users/Dan Fridman/.stata_kernel_cache/include.do\r\ninvalid syntax\r\nr(198);\r\n\r\n. `d1d0b5544eadcba44c5f1aa5695588da'\r\n. display \"test\"\r\ntest\r\n\r\n. `85a27f55e74d4469106bf93a0d482706'\r\n. include C:/Users/Dan Fridman/.stata_kernel_cache/include.do\r\ninvalid syntax\r\nr(198);\r\n\r\n. `cc64df03024327541235dabb93f09e00'\r\n. _StataKernelLog off\r\n\r\n#### Code Sample\r\n\r\n```stata\r\nclear all\r\n\r\ndisplay \"test\"\r\n\r\nforeach i in 1 2 3 4 {\r\n\tdisplay \"`i'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
