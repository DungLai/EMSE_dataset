When you execute a command that does not produce any output, it appears to leave a blank line in the workbook.  As a result, if you have something that involves a bunch of such commands (like clonevar) in a row, one gets an enormous number of blank lines, which then looks bad when you export to something else.  Is that something that could be changed, so that it doesn't leave a blank line for commands that do not have output?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
