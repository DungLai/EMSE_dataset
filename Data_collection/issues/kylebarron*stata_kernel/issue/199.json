Please note that the time message is indeed shown (although with a little variation from what Stata does: the kernel shows not only the time when the last command finished executing, but also when did so the next-to-last one), it simply adds an error message that does not seem to affect the expected behavior. \r\n\r\nIn my case, the error message is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[IPKernelApp] ERROR | Exception in message handler: Traceback (most recent call last): \r\nFile \"/home/hugoea/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel/kernelbase.py\", line 233, in dispatch_shell handler(stream, idents, msg) \r\nFile \"/home/hugoea/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel/kernelbase.py\", line 399, in execute_request user_expressions, allow_stdin) \r\nFile \"/home/hugoea/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/stata_kernel/kernel.py\", line 113, in do_execute self.post_do_hook() \r\nFile \"/home/hugoea/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/stata_kernel/kernel.py\", line 144, in post_do_hook self.stata.linesize = int(res.strip()) \r\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'r; t=0.00 19:02:19\\n255\\nr; t=0.00 19:02:19'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is not a serious problem of course, but can be annoying. Having the possibility of setting rmsg on can be a nice improvement.\r\n\r\nI take the chance to thank you for this awesome tool!\r\n\r\n#### Other information\r\n\r\n- elementary OS 0.4.1 Loki (64-bit)\r\n- 14.2MP\r\n- 1.5.5\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
