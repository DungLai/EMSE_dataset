Of course I have peeves about formatting but I'm self-aware in that I know they're subjective (and inconsistent Un_n).\r\n\r\n- `pyupgrade` seems like a good idea.\r\n- `black` looks good; I would assume moving from YAPF won't be hard.\r\n- `isort` seems fineâ€”I reckon consistency matters more than the actual choices in this case.\r\n- `click` seems nice (I _think_ I have a memory of `argparse` being annoying to work around when doing the magics but not 100%). \r\n- I have mixed feelings on static typing for python. In general I'm quite happy for languages to have static types (or optional static types, like with Julia). In Python's case the interpreter ignores it, AFAIK, which makes me sad ):\r\n\r\n    So if there's a situation where typing matters the check has to be added by the programmer. While `mypy` sounds like a good idea nonetheless, I guess it's hard for me to be excited about it when a) I haven't seen it in action and, more importantly, b) migrating to static typing seems by far to be the most labor-intensive bullet point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/1092172098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6391862552,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCI5E485HTusszwAAAAF8_BUY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/6391862552","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-07T20:29:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6391862560,"node_id":"SE_lADOCI5E485HTusszwAAAAF8_BUg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/6391862560","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-07T20:29:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
