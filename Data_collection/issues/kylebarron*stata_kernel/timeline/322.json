That being said, I'd be very hesitant to tinker with the current default behavior of more...\r\n\r\nDetermining when Stata has finished parsing and executing commands was a major issue when developing the kernel because there is no API that can help, so the kernel has to check the log file and use regexes to figure out what Stata's doing. As Kyle said, `more` was specially problematic in this respect, and we couldn't figure out a way to deal with `more` interactively, so the behavior of the kernel is to cut off the output when `more` appears.  This is annoying for the exact reason you point out, so Kyle's original solution actually _was_ to run `set more off` at the start of every kernel session. However, as part of a major refactor (and I also don't recall the exact reason) `set more on` was set to always run at the start of the kernel. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/567729550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/567882847","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/322#issuecomment-567882847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/322","id":567882847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Nzg4Mjg0Nw==","user":{"login":"alirezamarzban","id":52274001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjc0MDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52274001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezamarzban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-20T10:49:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T10:49:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi mr MacKerron\r\nplease help me\r\ni sent you an email\r\ni used https://github.com/jawj/IKEv2-setup to creat strongswan in my ubuntu server\r\ni've done everything as you said, but my problem is, i can't connect to my server, i just wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jawj/IKEv2-setup/master/setup.sh\r\nchmod u+x setup.sh\r\n./setup.sh run these command, and i passed the stepp, i can connect to strongswan, but i can't connect to my server, for example, when it asked me for my new ssh username and password, i typed my ssh username and password, but i can't connect to it, i even changed it, but i can't connect, now i reinstalled my os, but i need help to use your script\r\nmy email\r\nalireza.rick@gmail.com\r\ntelegram\r\nalirezaM192\r\nthank's","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/567882847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alirezamarzban","id":52274001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjc0MDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52274001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezamarzban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezamarzban/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
