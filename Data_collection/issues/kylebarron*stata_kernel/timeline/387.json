is interesting. Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Yeah probably not using any of our code. Don't think they'd be dumb enough to include a GPL3 dependency in their code...\r\n- It's hard to know much about their code because only their `stata_setup` module is [public](https://pypi.org/project/stata-setup/#files)\r\n- Because it's not pip-installable, you [need to tell Python users to change their `PYTHONPATH`](https://www.stata.com/python/pystata/install.html#ref-configuration) every time so they can import the pacakge. I'm sure there'll be a ton of support requests of Python not finding the `pystata` import\r\n- It doesn't define a Jupyter kernel. Instead it uses plain Python and just defines a few IPython magics. But the code is all running inside the regular Python kernel.\r\n- Since it doesn't define its own kernel, I'm curious if they're able to maintain data state on the Stata side. From `stata_setup` and their example, it looks like they maintain a running Stata session. Is it in a subprocess? How does Stata keep data in sync on the Python and Stata sides? Seems like it would be a pain in the butt for users to have to keep track of \"is my Python data the same as my Stata data\"\r\n\r\n\t![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15164633/115608359-643cb080-a2a3-11eb-8b6f-f2036f61bfd8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ```py\r\n    sys.path.append(os.path.join(path, 'utilities'))\r\n    from pystata import config \r\n    config.init(edition)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\tI assume data isn't persisted on the Python side and sent to Stata every time a Stata command is called... That would be a horribly slow experience for large data.\r\n\r\n- It's curious that they're integrating so much with Python... I imagine (hope) there will be some users for whom this introduces them more to Python's huge data science ecosystem, and then say \"why am I paying so much for Stata, when I see I can do everything I need here in Python\".

Two comments unrelated to the inner workings of the Stata Corp python module:\r\n\r\n1. The new pricing model which requires annual subscriptions is ridiculously expensive\r\n2. In my own research I never use Stata (use tensorflow and jax) but for the models I teach in an upper level econometrics class, statsmodels isn't there yet and R is too clunky as every Model we cover has a different API which isn't going to work for my students.  Since all of my colleagues use and teach with Stata, it would be unfair to students for me to force another workfow on them, although with the new prices I am having a difficult time seeing how my university can pay for all of these subscriptions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/825672906/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roblem","id":1871086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzEwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1871086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem","html_url":"https://github.com/roblem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/829927408","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/387#issuecomment-829927408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/387","id":829927408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTkyNzQwOA==","user":{"login":"roblem","id":1871086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzEwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1871086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem","html_url":"https://github.com/roblem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-30T08:17:13Z","updated_at":"2021-04-30T08:17:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Have been testing this out this morning (on linux) having just upgraded to Stata 17.
