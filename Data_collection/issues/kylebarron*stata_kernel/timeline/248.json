The issue is that I don't get to choose which Stata session I connect to. By default, it connects to the earliest opened Stata session, or it creates one if it doesn't exist. Then it hides the Stata GUI. The options are:\r\n\r\n- The existing behavior\r\n- I can set it so that `stata_kernel` always opens a new Stata GUI window, but then whenever the newly created Stata session closes, any Stata windows that had been opened previously are also closed. I don't know of a way around that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/442591504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/442597244","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/248#issuecomment-442597244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/248","id":442597244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjU5NzI0NA==","user":{"login":"jeremysze","id":6887005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODcwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6887005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremysze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremysze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T20:42:06Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T20:42:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
