My use case: I use Jupyter to type up teaching materials. Being able to inspect variables, data, etc. on the full interface is more convenient for me to create a clear and concise code for my students to learn from. What I'm thinking about is just a magic to `%show` or `%hide` the full interface, not that the interface should be shown throughout the Jupyter session. Up for discussion though, and thanks again for this awesome tool!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/440881901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"artt","id":1711188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTExODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1711188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt","html_url":"https://github.com/artt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1993591562,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk5MzU5MTU2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/1993591562","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-28T21:07:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/442647695","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/243#issuecomment-442647695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/243","id":442647695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjY0NzY5NQ==","user":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T23:35:53Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T23:35:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@fishix10
