you can't, I think it is fine to leave the graph windows that way since it won't flash out in the taskbar like the main window does. I actually tried `graph close` but as you said a graph window will still appear. If you run a couple of graphs in a row, Stata will automatically close them and only leave the last one open, so your taskbar won't be full of graph windows. Thus, I'm fine with the way it is now. \r\n\r\nIn terms of `%labels`, I think I just want it to show the variable names and their labels only. `describe` provides too much information. It's like you want to check `df.dtypes` but use `df.info()` to do so. I also realized that `%browse` only shows a limited number of rows in the dataset now, so I don't know if it would also be a challenge to show all of the variable labels in jupyter lab or Atom. Stata users tend to put a lot of variables in a single dataset due to the limitation of Stata's data structure. Meanwhile, once you get a lot variables, you may need a search feature to locate variable labels. I googled it, and it doesn't seem Stata has a line commond for that. \r\n\r\nI think it is a good idea to add a setting for Stata's main window in case that someone needs it for certain things e.g., import `.csv`. \r\n\r\nI was actually about to ask you if you are working on a autocomplete for Stata since you already have a package for `stata_language `.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/419682390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"StevenLi-DS","id":33796896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzk2ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33796896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenLi-DS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/419682691","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/125#issuecomment-419682691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/125","id":419682691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTY4MjY5MQ==","user":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-09T00:49:17Z","updated_at":"2018-09-09T00:49:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"> %browse only shows a limited number of rows in the dataset now\r\n\r\nI could add a setting to browse the entire dataset, but whenever you do `%browse`, you export the data from Stata to Python, which can take a while for large data.
