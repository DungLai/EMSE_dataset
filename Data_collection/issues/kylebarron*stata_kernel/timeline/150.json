See https://github.com/nikitakit/hydrogen-python/pull/10 for the difficulty of correctly implementing this feature.\r\n\r\nThis is something Hydrogen struggles with in general because of its language-independentness... Here's the same issue in Javascript.\r\n![peek 2018-09-07 15-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15164633/45240093-66e66500-b2b5-11e8-91dd-f822c5745190.gif)\r\n\r\nI think it's something that could be improved in Hydrogen...
