This project keeps all the data in Stata, enabling you to work with large amounts of data without having to move data back and forth between Stata and Python after every cell as `ipystata` does.\r\n\r\nAll of the magics are essentially custom Python commands that bring data into Python, reformat it in some way, and then display it to the user. Since the kernel itself is written in Python, the two ways to work with data are either to 1) run a Stata command, record the text output, and convey that text to the user, or 2) move the data to Python, work with the data in Python, and generate output text from Python to send to the user.\r\n\r\nMagics like `%%head` stay fast by moving very small amounts of data as the default. Otherwise, if you had a 100GB dataset in Stata, and you tried to `%%head` the whole thing, it would have to write the entire dataset to disk, read it all in Python, and print it in the kernel.\r\n\r\nSo because there's no good way to do general data work in Python without moving all the data to Python, this functionality was never built into the kernel, and is best as another script that works with data exported from Stata.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/575469673/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
