I believe the issue is with log file parsing in the completions engine. [Here](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/blob/master/stata_kernel/kernel.py#L357) the kernel tries to open the log file and spaces make it fail. That gets parsed by [this function](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/blob/master/stata_kernel/completions.py#L438-L472).\r\n\r\nSo I think that parsing has some bug that causes it to parse spaces incorrectly. In particular, the list of open log files is newline-separated, and it is cleaned in [this line](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/blob/master/stata_kernel/completions.py#L448) using [this regex](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/blob/master/stata_kernel/completions.py#L63).
