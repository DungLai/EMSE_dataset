everyone,\r\n\r\nI don't know if anyone wants to see this but it appears that we not only can execute Stata from VSCode, we can also run it on GitHub remote server using [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). At least using Stata 15 works for me. Thank you @kylebarron for making this library.
