You have to define the environment variable `STATA_KERNEL_USER_CONFIG_PATH`, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSTATA_KERNEL_USER_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/custom_stata_kernel.conf\r\n# start stata kernel in same console\r\n``` \r\n\r\nTested this out on Linux and it worked. Hope if works on your OS as well!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/909852862/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5236536489,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCI5E4846nUznzwAAAAE4HzSp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/5236536489","actor":{"login":"tatanlabra","id":5539246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzkyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5539246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra","html_url":"https://github.com/tatanlabra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-01T03:49:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5236536490,"node_id":"SE_lADOCI5E4846nUznzwAAAAE4HzSq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/5236536490","actor":{"login":"tatanlabra","id":5539246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzkyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5539246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra","html_url":"https://github.com/tatanlabra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tatanlabra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-01T03:49:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5236536491,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCI5E4846nUznzwAAAAE4HzSr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/5236536491","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-01T03:49:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5236536492,"node_id":"SE_lADOCI5E4846nUznzwAAAAE4HzSs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/5236536492","actor":{"login":"kylebarron",
