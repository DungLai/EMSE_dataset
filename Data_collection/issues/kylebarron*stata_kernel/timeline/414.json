In that case, the easiest workaround is to set environment variables in your terminal before launching Atom, so that it's pointign to the same Python as Jupyter. You should be able to verify they're the same by making sure `import sys; sys.executable` is the same in both Python environments. Then if stata_kernel works in one it should also work in the other.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/1027084686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/1027693932","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/414#issuecomment-1027693932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/414","id":1027693932,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCI5E4849QV1s","user":{"login":"StaffanBetner","id":8129424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjk0MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8129424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner","html_url":"https://github.com/StaffanBetner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StaffanBetner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-02T08:28:08Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T09:58:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It is the same Python environment.
