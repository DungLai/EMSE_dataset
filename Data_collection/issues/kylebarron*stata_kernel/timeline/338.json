Kyle, \r\n\r\nI've been having similar issues as others in getting Stata code to run inline in Atom. The error message I get when I try to run something is exactly the same as [#276](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/276). I have tried the fixes listed there as well as the recommendation to uninstall the kernel and reinstall an earlier version discussed in this thread. Still not working. I am running StataIC 16.1 on Windows 10. Is there something else I can try? Note that I don't have any issues with the R kernel and getting R code to run in case that helps to narrow it down. Thanks!
