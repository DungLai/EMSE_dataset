Is it possible for you to post the notebook that gave you the original issue?\r\n\r\nI also used the example notebook.\r\n\r\nMy workaround for Windows, in case it's helpful for anyone, was to use the \"session mode\" of ipystata (so that all cells can access the same underlying Stata session). That's not available for Linux/Mac though.
