It worked totally fine. No problems here. I quit the kernel and qtconsole.\r\n- Next, I add `profile.do` back to `C:\\ado`, consistsing only three ado-path additions as follows:\r\n  ```{stata}\r\n  adopath + \"C:/Users/gaksaray/Desktop/GitHub/stata-gautil\"\r\n  adopath + \"C:/Users/gaksaray/Desktop/GitHub/stata-uniqueby\"\r\n  adopath + \"C:/Users/gaksaray/Desktop/GitHub/epstopdf\"\r\n  ```\r\n- I run `jupyter qtconsole --kernel=stata` again. First thing I run `adopath` command to see if the ado-path addition in my `profile.do` has been read. I get\r\n```{stata}\r\nIn [1]: adopath\r\n  [1]  (BASE)      \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15\\ado\\base/\"\r\n  [2]  (SITE)      \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15\\ado\\site/\"\r\n  [3]              \".\"\r\n  [4]  (PERSONAL)  \"c:\\ado\\personal/\"\r\n  [5]  (PLUS)      \"c:\\ado\\plus/\"\r\n  [6]  (OLDPLACE)  \"c:\\ado/\"\r\n  [7]              \"C:\\Users\\gaksaray\\miniconda3\\envs\\stata_nb\\Lib\\site-packages\\stata_kernel\\ado\"\r\n```\r\nin other words, none of the ado paths specified in `profile.do` is read by the kernel. I repeat the `adopath` command and get:\r\n```{stata}\r\n  In [2]: adopath\r\n  . exit, clear\r\n```\r\nafter which kernel becomes unresponsive. Here is the log: [console_debug.log](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/files/5968381/console_debug.log)\r\n\r\n\r\nI can replicate this every single time: whenever there is an incongruence between the adopaths defined in `profile.do` and the adopaths initialized by kernel (which to me seems to happen when more than 2 adopaths are defined in `profile.do`), kernel dies unexpectedly at some point within

\r\n1. I know but I never write `exit, clear` on console. As you can see on my post, I just used `adopath` command twice: first it shows the adopaths and second it exits itself! So that `exit, clear` is just shown to me by the kernel after I use `adopath` command second time, and then the kernel tries to reconnect but unable to do so, and it just dies.\r\n2. It's is in the usual `C:/ado` folder. If I run Stata by itself (no kernel) everything works fine and Stata loads all the adopaths defined in `profile.do`.\r\n```{stata}\r\n. disp \"`c(sysdir_personal)'\"\r\nc:\\ado\\personal/\r\n\r\n. disp \"`c(sysdir_oldplace)'\"\r\nc:\\ado/\r\n```\r\nIt is always read by the kernel just fine if it consists only one or two ado paths. Things get weird if the does more than that.\r\n\r\n3. They don't appear in my log because the kernel breaks and cannot even write the log. That's why I said I tried deleting the cache files to recreate \"what happens on a fresh clean install with no cache files yet, and I run the kernel with a `profile.do` consisting of 3 or more adopath additions\", and it just crashes on the prompt repeatedly as shown on that crash error message; could not even write the log because kernel cannot start. So I would remove the `profile.do` from `C:/ado`, run the kernel successfully to allow it to write cache log files, then add `profile.do` back to `C:/ado`, run kernel again and we are back again at (1). This I can reproduce every single time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/778016419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gaksaray","id":72267919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjY3OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72267919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray","html_url":"https://github.com/gaksaray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4323403670,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDMyMzQwMzY3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/4323403670","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-12T06:57:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4323403674,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzMjM0MDM2NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/4323403674","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-12T06:57:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/778220476","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/378#issuecomment-778220476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/378","id":778220476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODIyMDQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-12T14:14:36Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T14:14:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@gaksaray

I type `adopath` and see the list of adopaths, which does **not** include the ones specified in `profile.do`. It doesn't update itself to read any `profile.do` that consists multiple adopath additions. This means either on the second cell, or at some point in the notebook, I will type a Stata command and the kernel will give me `.exit, clear` output and become unresponsive. I quit the qtconsole, which supposed to update the log files in `~/.stata_kernel_cache`; yet the log files are not updated. They still show the time on the first step! In other words, when this happens, kernel cannot write logs as well.\r\n\r\n> Does this also happen if you put things in `C:\\ado\\personal\\sysprofile.do` instead?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it does.\r\n\r\nI am attaching a screen record to demonstrate this whole

I see. My guess is that this has to do with how Stata's automation feature on Windows interacts with `profile.do`. I would try some things to debug (I seldom have access to Stata on Windows so hard to debug myself, and this error doesn't show up in console mode on my system): \r\n\r\n- Try moving `profile.do` into the folder where your Stata executable is installed. \r\n- Try an _empty_ `profile.do` and see if the kernel still has this problem.\r\n- Try a `profile.do` with something unrelated to `adopath`, like `global test hello` and see if `$test` is defined.\r\n- If it is defined, try defining at least 3 globals and see if that still works.\r\n- Try adding `exit 0` to the end of `profile.do`\r\n- Try removing the quotes from the paths in `profile.do`\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason Stata isn't registering `profile.do` properly; it's odd that you've mentioned it happens with many `adopath` calls but not with just one. Want to see if it happens generally or if it's specific to `adopath` for some reason.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/778265489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4325381048,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDMyNTM4MTA0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/4325381048","actor":{"login":"gaksaray","id":72267919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjY3OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72267919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray","html_url":"https://github.com/gaksaray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-12T15:33:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4325381053,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzMjUzODEwNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/4325381053","actor":{"login":"gaksaray","id":72267919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjY3OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72267919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray","html_url":"https://github.com/gaksaray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-12T15:33:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/778347055","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/378#issuecomment-778347055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/378","id":778347055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODM0NzA1NQ==","user":{"login":"gaksaray","id":72267919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjY3OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72267919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray","html_url":"https://github.com/gaksaray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaksaray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-12T17:55:29Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T17:55:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mcaceresb
