It is possible that the kernel is not able to find your Stata installation though. Have you tried manually setting Stata's path in `stata_kernel.conf`?\r\n\r\nIn general, Stata 17 have introduced a number of changes that breaks compatibility with stata_kernel. You might want to try [pystata-kernel](https://github.com/ticoneva/pystata-kernel), which works mostly just like stata_kernel but specifically for Stata 17.
