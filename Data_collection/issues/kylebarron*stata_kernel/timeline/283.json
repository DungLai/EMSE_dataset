just tried it out on Edge on Windows 10 and I can reproduce your issue.\r\n\r\nYou can read through #234 to see the annoying problem we were trying to solve. Basically, SVG images were interfering with each other, and the way we solved that was by putting each SVG image inside an `<iframe>` tag. Apparently that works fine on all browsers but IE/Edge. StataCorp acknowledged a bug, but a fix won't come out until the next major or minor release, and who knows when that will be. \r\n\r\nEasy solutions:\r\n- Don't use IE/Edge\r\n- Set the graph format to PNG instead of SVG. Run `%set graph_format png` or `%set graph_format png --permanently`. \r\n  \r\n  I haven't created any way to use a system-wide configuration file, so there's no way to have this option be the default for multiple users on the system.
