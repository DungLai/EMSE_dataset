If there is anything else following mata, it is evaluated inline, and does not enter the mata environment\r\n4. `end` can be preceded by any number of spaces and followed by __anything__\r\n5. It doesn't matter where `end` appears. In a loop, a function, etc. The mata environment will end at that point.\r\n6. `mata` is not nested, as `mata` itself is a valid `mata` command.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/411245681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/411246105","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/29#issuecomment-411246105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/29","id":411246105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTI0NjEwNQ==","user":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T00:35:57Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T00:35:57Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thanks.
