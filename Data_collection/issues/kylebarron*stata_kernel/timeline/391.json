apologies, my above statement:\r\n> @mcaceresb unfortunatly, it's not all. it seems that under Stata 17, `capture noisily` suppresses the `(note: file foo.png not found)` issued in earlier versions of Stata. This seems to be relevant for the first line of `clean_log_eol()` in stata_session.py, if my reading of the code is correct (sorry, I'm a python beginner)\r\n\r\n... is wrong (it seems that I've created a mess fiddling around simultaneously with Stata 16 and 17...).\r\n\r\nWhat is correct, however, is the following:\r\n\r\n- The note Stata issues after `graph export path/foo.png, replace` if foo.png does not already exist reads `(note: file path/foo.png not found)` under Stata 16 but `(file path/foo.png not found)`  (without \"note:\") under Stata 17.\r\n- The note Stata issues after successfully saving path/foo.png reads `(file path/foo.png written in PNG format)` under Stata 16 but `file path/foo.png saved as PNG format`  (without parentheses)  under Stata 17.\r\n\r\nObviously this makes it difficult to define `g_exp` in `expect()` for both Stata 16 and 17. -> it may be necessary to add a config-setting for the Stata-version in use (or read it from the `c(version)` in Stata?).\r\n\r\nFor my own use, I adapted `g_expect` to `g_exp = r'(?<![(])file {}'.format(self.cache_dir_str[:34])`, changed the regex in `clean_log_eol()`  to `r'^\\((?:note: )?file {}/graph\\d+\\.({}) not found\\)'...` and left the one in `expect_graph()` unchanged compared to #392, which fixes the issue.
