It's impossible to know when you hit the first `\\n` whether the command prints nothing, because it could print stuff after. I suppose I could refrain from sending back anything until I hit the first non whitespace line. Then once I hit that send back that line's text in addition to the previous newlines that I had withheld.\r\n2. As you can tell from the screenshot, my lexer includes preceding newlines with a command. So the lexer changes `\\s\\s\\s\\s\\* Set up\\n` to `\\s\\s\\s\\s\\n`. But that's still sent with `local progname \"filename\"`. So I think it would make sense to strip those repetitive newlines from the input. Then it would send just `local progname \"filename\"` or possibly `    local progname filename` instead of `\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tlocal progname filename`.\r\n sometimes there are extra","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/414382595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1798705146,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc5ODcwNTE0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/1798705146","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"349d434936a2ac64a4ff8f165be6ff3f00e04980","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/commits/349d434936a2ac64a4ff8f165be6ff3f00e04980","created_at":"2018-08-20T21:06:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
