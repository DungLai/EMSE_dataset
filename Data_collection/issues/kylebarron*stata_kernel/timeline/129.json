I don't dislike electron apps in the abstract! My issue is that I'm usually comparing it with something that has a very small memory footprint and little to no lag. For something like a text editor, where the main thing I want is to edit text, all the bells and whistles, while really nice and I like and want them, don't justify the trade-off _for me specifically_.\r\n\r\nIn this case, tho, I'm 100% with you that nteract looks awesome! Because it's not really that different from qtconsole in terms of lag, and I'm already willing to make that trade-off relative to console apps. It's also way better than notebooks in my browser (which I kind of really dislike). Since it looks better than qtsoncole, is equally minimal in design, and supports HTML, from my POV it's basically just a much better version.
