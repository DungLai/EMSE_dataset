"@kylebarron Thanks for the quick reply. I absolutely see, that this outdated versions combination is locking me down. I totally understand that there is no good solution with native support.\r\n@mcaceresb Your solution is quite interesting and I think probably the best way forward. Still, I would rather see a eps to pdf conversion, e.g. with epstopdf which is easily available via texlive. The kernel help page reads, that pdf is maybe not displayed correctly outside jupyter but I think this is still the best format. Alternatively, svg (the kernels standard) could be used with e.g. inkscape. Besides, I am stuck with an older version of the kernel (see #339 ) and would prefer not to mess my setup. ;-) So I may not test the solution until it is properly released.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/617681959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FHeidemann","id":13793793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzkzNzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13793793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann","html_url":"https://github.com/FHeidemann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHeidemann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3259834429,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1OTgzNDQyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/3259834429","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-22T10:04:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3259834439,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTk4MzQ0Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/3259834439","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-22T10:04:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3259834451,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1OTgzNDQ1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/3259834451","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-22T10:04:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3259834457,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTk4MzQ0NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/3259834457","a
