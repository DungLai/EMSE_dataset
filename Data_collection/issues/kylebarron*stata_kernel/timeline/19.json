Since Atom/Hydrogen is selection based, there are tons of times I want to just run the local by itself to see its value, and hate having to type ``di \"`macro'\"``, like\r\n```stata\r\npower_param, `options' v2 _value outcome(`out') suffix(`suffix') `controls' if(if `base' & `sample1')\r\n```\r\nIdeally I'd love to be able to select just `` `out'`` and press `ctrl-enter` to see its value. I think this would be straightforward with the restriction that in this mode you couldn't store a program name in a macro and send just the macro to run it. -- If the first character sent to the

I haven't tried introspection in qtconsole yet.\r\n\r\n> Random suggestion: Wouldn't it be easier to make a...macro/function/shortcut (not sure what the term is in atom) that grabs a word chunk and if it is a local then send disp `\"`local'\"' or is that actually more cumbersome?\r\n\r\nNo that would actually be really annoying because it would have to alter the text in the editor under the selection, run Hydrogen, then alter the text back.\r\n\r\n> I think we can add an option\r\n\r\nYes but I think it's still best to only inspect objects that we know are objects. And then try running it in Stata if it doesn't exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/415838534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1847157166,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE4NDcxNTcxNjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/1847157166","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-14T22:31:13Z","milestone":{"title":"1.7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/460482729","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/19#issuecomment-460482729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/19","id":460482729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDQ4MjcyOQ==","user":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-05T01:41:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T01:41:07Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing
