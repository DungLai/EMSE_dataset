Specifically Hydrogen, Jupyter console, or Jupyter QtConsole? Jupyter Notebook is the only one of the four that use CodeMirror for syntax highlighting (Jupyter console and Qtconsole use Pygments, and Hydrogen uses my Atom Stata syntax highlighting package). I'm not sure it's ideal for me to be serving up Javascript that those frontends won't be able to handle.\r\n\r\nThe best option would just be to add Stata syntax highlighting to the CodeMirror repository itself. Though then there would be a lag until the next release and when Jupyter Notebook uses that next release.\r\n\r\nI can look into this a bit more in the future, but at the moment it isn't a high priority compared to making sure the package is stable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/414468705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/417898980","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/4#issuecomment-417898980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/4","id":417898980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzg5ODk4MA==","user":{"login":"StevenLi-DS","id":33796896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzk2ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33796896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenLi-DS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-02T01:45:36Z","updated_at":"2018-09-02T01:45:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've
