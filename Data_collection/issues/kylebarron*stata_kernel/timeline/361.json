Also, if the environment where jupyter is installed is added to the path in your shell then you can run its executables from any environment.\r\n\r\nI thought I read somewhere that it is the preferred way of using notebooks with multiple environments but I cannot find the source so I might have been wrong :/ It's definitely one of the valid options, though: [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068818/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks-in-a-conda-environment)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that pip will install another copy because it (correctly) sees that jupyter is not installed in that environment.
