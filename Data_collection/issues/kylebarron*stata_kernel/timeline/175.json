Time to export an already-created image is negligible.\r\n\r\nI'd caution against believing this too much. Exporting an image that doesn't have a ton of info in it certainly doesn't take too long. If you make a histogram from 10M obs, it's very comparable to one from 1k obs because in both cases you are exporting a few dozen bars, the axes, titles, labels, etc. None of that is too taxing. However, the more complex the graph the more complex the export. An exaggerated example to illustrate the point:\r\n\r\n```stata\r\nclear\r\ntempfile test\r\nsysuse auto\r\nkeep price mpg\r\nexpand 10000\r\nscatter price mpg\r\nreplace price = price + 100 * runiform()\r\ngraph export `test'.svg, as(svg)\r\ngraph export `test'.pdf, as(pdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe svg export takes 6 seconds and the pdf export takes 35. The svg image is 177MiB in size and the pdf is 36MiB. You can think of this as a corner case, but my point is that turning off the graph redundancy should be an option.\r\n\r\nTbh, png would be my choice if it was available in the console version (GUI can make PNGs just fine btw). The 2nd best idea does seem to be doing the pdf + svg, but, as I said, I would worry a bit more about how much space and time this could end up taking (i.e. include an option to turn off the redundancy).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/421504450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/421519807","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/175#issuecomment-421519807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/175","id":421519807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTUxOTgwNw==","user":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-15T01:11:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-15T01:11:24Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Very valid points.

(I guess stuff like this is why %matplotlib is not inline by default?)\r\n\r\nThat's a good idea. Additionally, when someone saves an `.ipynb` file, _all_ data sent to the kernel is included within that file. This means that the file can be rendered, as with [nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer) without any dependencies outside the file. But of course, if we send a 50MB svg and a 50MB pdf, a single graph will add 100MB to the size of the `.ipynb` file.\r\n\r\n> and OSX if the console can export PDFs there\r\n\r\nI assume you meant if the console can export PNGs. I just tried on macOS and also got a `translator Graph2png not found` error.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps it would be better to use PNGs in Windows\r\n\r\nMy personal belief is that SVGs/vector graphics in general usually look much better than PNGs, and so SVGs should be the default where possible.\r\n\r\n> I wouldn't worry too much about image quality in this case. I think the main purpose is illustrative; if a user wants to send an image they'd save it explicitly.\r\n\r\nI don't entirely agree. I could definitely envision creating reports from a Jupyter Notebook. You don't have to worry about exporting the images and then loading them somewhere else. For people who have LaTeX installed but don't know/want to write their documents in it, it's really helpful to have the Notebook's one-click option to PDF. And in that case I definitely value image quality in the PDF.\r\n\r\nFunctionality to hide code is kinda minimal (https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/155), or else people might realistically use Notebook exports as full reports.\r\n\r\n> For the redundancy...yes, I do think it should be on by default wherever we end up putting SVGs as default.\r\n\r\nMaybe have a setting for SVG redundancy turned _on_ by default and a setting for PNG redundancy turned _off_ by default? (I haven't checked if both a PNG and a PDF get sent to Jupyter, which is exported in the LaTeX PDF).\r\n\r\n> My reasoning is that silent failures are worse than annoying warnings:\r\n> \r\n> we can't necessarily tell them how to fix it (they'd have to look it up, right?)\r\n\r\nWell it's not a silent failure.
