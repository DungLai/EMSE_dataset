Uninstall stata_kernel\r\n2. Uninstall Stata\r\n3. Reinstall Stata IC from Stata website and run updates (none necessary). Close open Stata instance.\r\n4. Install stata_kernel and run `python -m stata_kernel.install`\r\n5. Modify `.stata_kernel.conf` line 5 to read `stata_path = /Applications/Stata/StataIC.app/Contents/MacOS/StataIC\r\n`\r\n6. Confirm StataIC path by running `/Applications/Stata/StataIC.app/Contents/MacOS/StataIC` directly from the terminal - confirmed that Stata launches.\r\n7.  Launch Jupyter Notebook and create new notebook using Stata Kernel.\r\n8. The kernel launches and Stata launches automatically.\r\n9.
