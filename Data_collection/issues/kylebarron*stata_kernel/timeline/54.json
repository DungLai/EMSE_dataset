never looked into mata but it's good to know that `stata(log close)` would work. \r\n\r\nThe much more interesting part of this is that almost certainly I can send results back to Jupyter as a stream

Contrast that with the current nature of the Jupyter kernel. It waits for the entire command to be finished, then reads the log file. It's clear that the stream data is more interesting.\r\n\r\nIt appears that with pexpect you can [log output as a stream](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pexpect.html#pexpect.spawn.logfile_read) (I have to look more into that)? And obviously if there's a single log file from Automation, that can be read as a stream too.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I've never worked with streaming files before and I'd be quite excited to learn how to do it.
