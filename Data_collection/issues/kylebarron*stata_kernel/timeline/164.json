This is actually a bug with the code that the underlying syntax highlighter, Pygments, uses to highlight Stata code, and not specifically an issue with this kernel. @mcaceresb originally wrote that; I've been meaning to update it, but haven't gotten around to it yet, and hadn't been aware of any actual errors like this.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty easy to fix this. Should be able to within a few days.\r\n\r\nNote for me and @mcaceresb:\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, create a file `test.do` with the contents ``` `\"`r(levels)'\"' ``` then run\r\n```\r\npygmentize -O full -f html -l stata -o test.html test.do\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe red box here\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15164633/45442874-375aa280-b691-11e8-8894-b94048aee664.png)\r\nin HTML has class `err`:\r\n```html\r\n<span class=\"err\">r(levels)</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Stata pygments lexer [source](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/src/7941677dc77d4f2bf0bbd6140ade85a9454b8b80/pygments/lexers/stata.py), the flow goes like this:\r\n\r\n- See `` `\" ``, enter `vars-strings` and then add `String` scope and enter into `string_mquote`. \r\n- Inside `string_mquote`, it then matches `` ` ``, which adds scope `Name.Variable` and enters into `var_validlocal`.\r\n- Inside `var_validlocal`, the only rule is `\\w{0,31}`. But locals can include many more characters, such as `(`. Since there is no fallback option, this produces an error in
