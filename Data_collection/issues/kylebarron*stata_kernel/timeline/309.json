using Stata 16 from within Atom via the stata_kernel already for some days now, and it works fine. As @mcaceresb already said, the execption is the integration of python into stata, which is not supported by the stata_kernel (it get stuck, if you try to use it). Great to hear that @mcaceresb plans to add python support to the kernel!\r\nUnfortunetly, my python skills are too limited to contribute to that. However, I can confirm that it should be relatively straightforward to build the python support in the style of mata support, as python is integrated into stata very much the same way as mata is integrated into stata, which can be seen from the following examples, showing the three ways to call python interactively from within stata:\r\n```\r\n. // Enter Python interactive environment (with colon: exit python in case of error)\r\n. python:\r\n----------------------------------------------- python (type end to exit) ---------------------\r\n>>> for x in range(3):\r\n...         print(x)\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n>>> end\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n. \r\n. // Enter Python interactive environment (without

works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/548998769/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcaceresb","id":4219197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTkxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4219197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb","html_url":"https://github.com/mcaceresb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcaceresb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2764855604,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2NDg1NTYwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/2764855604","actor":{"login":"StevenLi-DS","id":33796896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzk2ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33796896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenLi-DS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-02T01:45:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2764855607,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjQ4NTU2MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/2764855607","actor":{"login":"StevenLi-DS","id":33796896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzk2ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33796896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenLi-DS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-02T01:45:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2764945262,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc2NDk0NTI2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/events/2764945262","actor":{"login":"StevenLi-DS","id":33796896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzk2ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33796896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenLi-DS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenLi-DS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-02T04:26:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kylebarron/stata_kernel/issues/comments/584343298","html_url"
