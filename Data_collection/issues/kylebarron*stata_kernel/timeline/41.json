But when the terminal is set to 80 chars, the output is never wider than 80 chars. For example:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15164633/43853583-908819da-9b0e-11e8-8dd9-475b0e54edf6.png)\r\n    And this is on a vertical montor. Most people use horizontal monitors and might want to be able to view their results with less vertical space\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n- It's hard to know what a good width value is. \r\n\r\nNote that both
