So it might be optimal, on Automation, to save a do file and `include` it for all text longer than a single line.\r\n\r\nAlmost 100% of the time that the kernel is used interactively in the console, only one line is sent at a time. It's hard, if even possible, to run more than one line at a time unless you paste it in, in which case really low latency should matter slightly less. So the times when people might want really fast latency the most is a line at a time...\r\n\r\nIt would simplify things a _lot_ to lex the code and then say \r\n\r\n1. Is the code a single line without any blocks and without `qui` or `cap`? If so, run it through pexpect.sendline() on console and `DoCommand` on automation.\r\n2. Otherwise, save the code to a do file, `include` it by running `DoCommand` on automation and pexpect.sendline() on console.\r\n\r\nFor everything, read log file output using fdpexpect. I never have to use `child.expect` on console. Once I receive the SHA1 hash with `fdpexpect.expect`, the child must also be done, and I can send more data. I can't imagine it takes much longer for Stata to write output to a file than to display it on the screen.\r\n\r\nSo @mcaceresb what do you think about running _anything_ longer than a line through
