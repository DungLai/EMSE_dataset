Issues Policy acknowledgement\n\n- [X] I have read and agree to submit bug reports in accordance with the [issues policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\n\n### Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\n\n### MLflow version\n\nmlflow-skinny==1.27.0\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10 Enterprise\r\n- **Python version**:  3.9.14\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**: \r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nWhen saving a model and passing a pip_requirements list with mlflow-skinny but not mlflow, the resulting requirements.txt has a first line with a mlflow (without version). An example illustrates this better. \r\n\r\nWhen running something like the code below:\r\n```python\r\npackages = [\"mlflow-skinny==1.27.0\", \"other-package==1.0.0\"]\r\nmlflow.statsmodels.log_model(\r\n        model,\r\n        \"model\",\r\n        conda_env=None,\r\n        signature=model_signature,\r\n        pip_requirements=packages,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe saved requirements.txt will have the following contents:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow\r\nmlflow-skinny==1.27.0\r\nother-package==1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is undesired when the original environment does not have mlflow, but only mlflow-skinny for example.\r\n\r\nI was able to track down the issue to the function [mlflow.utils.environment._contains_mlflow_requirement](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/2e4bb67d0eb9e25b4de480bee2301274ebc96882/mlflow/utils/environment.py#L441). \r\n\r\nThis function will return False for mlflow-skinny, which triggers the code below ([from here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/2e4bb67d0eb9e25b4de480bee2301274ebc96882/mlflow/utils/environment.py#L464)):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    if not _contains_mlflow_requirement(pip_reqs):\r\n        pip_reqs.insert(0, \"mlflow\")\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nIn my case I'm using the statsmodels API, but it doesn't really matter since it's calling the code below.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\ndefault_pip_reqs = [\"mlflow-skinny==1.27.0\", \"other-package==1.0.0\"]\r\n\r\n_, pip_reqs, _ = mlflow.utils.environment._process_pip_requirements(default_pip_reqs)\r\nprint(pip_reqs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prints:\r\n```\r\n['mlflow', 'mlflow-skinny==1.27.0', 'other-package==1.0.0']\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\nNo errors in this case, so not sure what to print here. This is the output from the code above.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n['mlflow', 'mlflow-skinny==1.27.0', 'other-package==1.0.0']\r\n```\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
