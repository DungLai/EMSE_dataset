Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [+] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: NO\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI have model sklearn stored in my registry.\r\nwhen trying to load a model using python, I get an error:\r\nOSError: No such file or directory: '/ ml / ml / mlflow / artifactstore / 0 / 79fe7d4d20ec4b1f9cbc9555d839e4e6 / artifacts / ModelName /.'\r\nIndeed, there is no such path in the OS, and the model itself in the OS is on a different path:\r\n/ ml / ml / mlflow / artifactstore / 0 / <other hash> / artifacts / ModelName /. '\r\n\r\nI store an onnx type model in the register and do not observe such problems.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport mlflow.sklearn\r\nimport sklearn\r\nimport mlflow.pyfunc\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://localhost:5000\")\r\nmodel_name = \"MoDelName\"\r\nstage = 'Production'\r\nlocation_path=\"/ml/ml1_rgs/exp_model\"\r\n\r\npath = \"models:/\" + model_name + \"/\" + stage\r\n\r\nsklearn_model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(path)\r\n\r\nmlflow.sklearn.save_model(sklearn_model, location_path)\r\n```\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [+] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [+] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
