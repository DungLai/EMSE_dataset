Here's what you would expect: \r\n<img width=\"1468\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-01 at 1 52 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/940521/68055877-ea7bc600-fcae-11e9-90ca-348a894ab7fa.png\">\r\n\r\nBut here is the UI I see, in both my local environment as well as built in a Docker container. \r\n<img width=\"1799\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-01 at 1 46 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/940521/68055681-72ad9b80-fcae-11e9-845b-0a287426f8ad.png\">\r\n`corpus_path` is a parameter, and `foo` and `foo2` are metrics, but you can't see that from this rendering of the UI. \r\n\r\nLonger parameter names don't seem to wrap around and I can't see those from the UI unless I inspect element. Basically, the UI isn't rendering as expected. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n- create a Conda environment and install mlflow with `pip install mlflow==1.4.0`\r\n- run `mlflow server --backend-store-uri ${DB_CONNECTION} --default-artifact-root ${ARTIFACT_ROOT} --host ${HOST} --port ${PORT}` or even `mlflow ui`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ssami","id":940521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/940521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami","html_url":"https://github.com/ssami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssami/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2032/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
