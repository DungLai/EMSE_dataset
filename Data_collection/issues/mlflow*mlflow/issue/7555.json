I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n- Client: 1.23.1\r\n- Tracking server: 2.0.1\r\n\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: \r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.6\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nAs you can see, the MLflow version and the tracking serve is not the same. And when I am trying to log artifact and an exception occurs. So I am wondering if this is caused by the different version from client and tracking.\r\n\r\nI have to keep python version at 3.6.6 due to my machine learning python code.\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n``` python\r\n# I am trying to log artifact with userClient\r\nclient.log_artifact(run.info.run_id, zip_file_path, artifact_path=pickle_artifact_path)\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\n``` python \r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/miniconda3/envs/env_opp/lib/python3.6/site-packages/requests/models.py\", line 384, in prepare_url\r\n    scheme, auth, host, port, path, query, fragment = parse_url(url)\r\n  File \"/opt/miniconda3/envs/env_opp/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/util/url.py\", line 397, in parse_url\r\n    return six.raise_from(LocationParseError(source_url), None)\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 3, in raise_from\r\nurllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError: Failed to parse: https://XXXXXX:None/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts/3/f688903569444af6b79c4064c74af19f/artifacts/test/delivery_tags_VB.xlsx\r\n```\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"Voigt1022","id":20470114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDcwMTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20470114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022","html_url":"https://github.com/Voigt1022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Voigt1022/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
