Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.7.10\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe problem I encountered is that `Run Command` showed on frontend when I run experiment on databricks shows different command than command that was actually used for running the experiment and therefore the experiment is not reproducible.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nFor example if I run locally:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow run . -e main -P parameter=ab -b databricks --backend-config meta/training_cluster.json --experiment-name /some/path/experiment-1 --no-conda\r\n```\r\n\r\nI end up on databricks mlflow frontend with following command being shown as `Run Command`:\r\n```\r\nmlflow run file:///Users/xxx/projects/project -v xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -e main -b databricks -P parameter=ab\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere some of the parameters I used are missing (`backend-config`, `no-conda`, `experiment-name`) and therefore the run is not reproducible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar issue happens if I use mlflow run from python:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        mlflow.projects.run(\r\n            uri='.', \r\n            entry_point='main',\r\n            backend='databricks',\r\n            backend_config='meta/training_cluster.json',\r\n            synchronous=True,\r\n            experiment_name='/some/path/experiment-1',\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case the `Run Command` shown of frontend is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow run file:///Users/xxx/projects/project -v xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -e main -b local\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the `Run Command` says it was run locally and not on databricks and therefore it is misleading and not reproducible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
