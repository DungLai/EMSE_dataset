Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nIn the experiment comparison, \"compare data on hover\" shows the metric. I feel it might be more useful if the parameters can be shown. \r\n![newplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46158005/147480978-34621901-7d81-48e9-b909-71ab16c6dd62.png)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Comparison of different experimental runs; when the experiments are grouped by parameters. It is currently to convenient (at least for me to track the parameters from graphs).\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Pls. see above and the graphs.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Pls see above and graphs.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Currently, the comparison is not convenient when the experiment management is based on experiments. Eg, if the project name is \"CatsDogsClassification\", the experiment might involve trying out a couple of models. Those would be the experiment name: eg \"DenseNet121\", \"SENet154\".  There would be multiple runs of each of these networks. Now, if we want to compare key parameters, this is not possible unless we start encoding the parameter name in the experiment Run Name. This makes it unnaturally long. Therefore, along with the key metric, if there is some way of displaying the parameters; i think it will be useful.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
