Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in MLflow or a feature request.\r\n\r\nI have a nginx proxy server that redirects to the container that has mlflow installed and running server on port 5000. So for eg. https://server-ip:port/ml-flow-server/\r\n\r\nThis is the redirect that points to my container that runs mlflow on port 5000.\r\n\r\nI am running mlflow on the container like this. mlflow folder is present\r\nmlflow server --file-store /mlflow --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\nDo i need to change or do in order to make it work. i read about setting some tracking URI variable but i am not clear what should i set it too. I tried to export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://server-ip:port/ml-flow-server but it dint work.\r\n\r\nPlease help\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback.
