The CLI `mlflow run --experiment-id ID ...` allows you to specify the id. But I still think the actual script should allow you to specify the experiment id (and overwrite it?) or at least the experiment id should be part of the MLproject file.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nThe code looks something like this:\r\n```python\r\n# exp1.py\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"cifar10\")\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n    print(\"exp id:\", run.info.experiment_id)\r\n    # mlflow.log_...\r\n```\r\nAnd running it like this does not set the experiment:\r\n```\r\nmlflow run exp1.py\r\n```\r\nbut uses the default experiment 0.\r\n\r\nMaybe related:\r\n- #673","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
