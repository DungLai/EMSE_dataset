We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @BenWilson2 in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: OSX 10.15\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow ui`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nIn the MLflow experiment UI, the dropdown for sorting columns (i.e. parameters, metrics, and tags) in the Runs table in ascending / descending order is narrow, so column names are cut off.\r\n\r\nFor example, see:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1098\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 8 42 00 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39497902/133720640-c22741a8-8b6c-49b7-9818-d5ca47f5b12b.png\">\r\n\r\nThis dropdown should be widened.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Run the following Python code and then launch the MLflow UI by running `mlflow ui` from the same directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nfor _ in range(10):\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        for i in range(10):\r\n            mlflow.log_param(\"my_medium_param_key_\" + str(i), str(i))\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the column sorting dropdown in the experiment UI\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4822/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
