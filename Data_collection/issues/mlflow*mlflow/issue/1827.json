My problem is that every time I compare runs with the parallel coordinates Plot, I have to add metrics again and again and hide parameters. This costs time and nerves.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1827/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
