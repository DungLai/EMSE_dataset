I think this data format is way superior than Json for this task. For example, Jsonnet configs are used in popular NLP library [allennlp](https://allennlp.org/).\r\n\r\n My intention is to save a config file with each run, but sadly this data format is not recognized in artifact view as a text file. That means I cannot view full details of the run in the UI. I think this could be fixed by changing this [line](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/544121854d4c0c56d27be72beb6f7a50fa3aafed/mlflow/server/js/src/utils/FileUtils.js#L13).
