Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in MLflow or a feature request.\r\n\r\nFollow [MLFlow's quickStart](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html), I install the `python 3.7.3` (I put python in `/usr/local/python3Dir`), `anaconda(conda)` and `pip install mlflow`, I use `git clone` the example in github. The example is in `/home/k8s/mlflow/mlflow/` directory, the first `mlflow` directory is created by me, the second `mlflow` is created by `git clone`, when I enter `/home/k8s/mlflow/mlflow`, I try to run some example, it tells me could not find `mlflow`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   (base) [k8s@k8s mlflow]$ python examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py\r\n\r\n   Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n   File \"examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py\", line 15, in <module>\r\n     import mlflow\r\n   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mlflow'\r\n```\r\nIt could find `myflow` command, though I myself do not know where `myflow` module is installed?\r\n```\r\n   (base) [k8s@k8s mlflow]$ mlflow --version\r\n   /usr/local/python3Dir/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/environment.py:26: YAMLLoadWarning: calling yaml.load() without Loader=... is deprecated, as the default Loader is unsafe.

If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\nTry to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"juhanishen","id":8583850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODM4NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8583850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen","html_url":"https://github.com/juhanishen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhanishen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
