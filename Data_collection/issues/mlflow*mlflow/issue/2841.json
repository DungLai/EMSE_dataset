Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nThe filter string in ` mlflow.search_runs(filter_string=\"\")` allows to filter for ['metric', 'parameter', 'tag', 'attribute'] however I would like to filter by entrypoint\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nI run a lot of different experiments all logged in the same tracking server. \r\nTo generate meaningful dashboards I would like to filter by entrypoint. On the tracking ui I see also many other fields besides \"status\" and \"artifact_uri\" like \"user' and \"source\" which would generate meaningful filters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(this seems to be so obvious that I probably don't see how I can do this already today)","closed_by":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2841/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
