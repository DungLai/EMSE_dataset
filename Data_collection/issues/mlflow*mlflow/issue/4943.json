Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes.

I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: no\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 21.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: n/a\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nThe Model Registry web UI allows me to create a model with an apostrophe in the name (i.e. `Cariad's Model`), but the model cannot be opened.
