Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduce a Python API for search_registered_models:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.search_registered_models(filter_string: Optional[str] = None, max_results: int = 100, order_by: Optional[List[str]] = None)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nHelp users easily search registered models without having to handle pagination\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? ^ \r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? ^ \r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Users must rely on the https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_registered_models API, which requires them to handle page tokens manually\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThe API should be implemented in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7f2152370b8e93ed7bf8cc3e5e1e7ff39cd69ca5/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\r\n\r\nThe only difference between this API and https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_registered_models is that it should automatically handle pagination: instead of including a `page_token` argument, the API should 1. call https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_registered_models, 2. retrieve the page token from the PagedList, 3. Call https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_registered_models with the page token and append the results to the previous PagedList, 4. Continue until https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_registered_models no longer returns a page token.\r\n\r\nFor reference, see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7f2152370b8e93ed7bf8cc3e5e1e7ff39cd69ca5/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py#L1154-L1167. MLflow provides a utility to help with pagination: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7f2152370b8e93ed7bf8cc3e5e1e7ff39cd69ca5/mlflow/utils/__init__.py#L224.\r\n\r\nWe can add some simple tests to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/tests/tracking/fluent/test_fluent.py.\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
