Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Centos 8\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip install mlflow\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow.pytorch.log_model(some_ddp_model, some_path)` is enough to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe following code block:\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/8acf7a4f36b97a2e96237b8c4fe20c93f98305bb/mlflow/utils/requirements_utils.py#L235-L248\r\nwill encounter: `RuntimeError: Default process group has not been initialized, please make sure to call init_process_group.` if the model is a DDP model. You can verify it easily, and the reason if very simple: you spawn a new process to execute the code, and in that process the DDP is not initialized.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n`mlflow.pytorch.log_model(some_ddp_model, some_path)` is enough to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\nSome logs:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/app/miniconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mlflow/utils/environment.py\", line 214, in
