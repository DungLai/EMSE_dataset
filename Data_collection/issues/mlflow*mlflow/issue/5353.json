Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux PopOS 21.10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.1, pyspark: 3.2.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMy experiment's `artifact_location` is a remote one (Google Storage). After training Spark model I'm using `mlflow.log_model` to register it - the model is saved into the correct location together with all the metadata, but it's not visible in the \"runs list\" view due to lack of tag `mlflow.log-model.history`. It's also treated as a normal (non-model) artifact on the run details view.\r\n\r\nWhen using another experiment with the local artifacts path - everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nFirst, download GCS connector to use the direct way of logging the model:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/cloud/bigdataoss/gcs-connector/hadoop3-2.2.4/gcs-connector-hadoop3-2.2.4-shaded.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import HashingTF, Tokenizer\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nspark = (SparkSession.builder\r\n    .config('spark.jars', 'gcs-connector-hadoop3-2.2.4-shaded.jar')\r\n    .config('spark.hadoop.fs.gs.impl', 'com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem')\r\n    .getOrCreate())\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(\"experiment-with-non-local-artifact-location\", \"gs://bucket-name/path\")\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"experiment-with-non-local-artifact-location\")\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    training = spark.createDataFrame([\r\n        (0, \"a b c d e spark\", 1.0),\r\n        (1, \"b d\", 0.0),\r\n        (2, \"spark f g h\", 1.0),\r\n        (3, \"hadoop mapreduce\", 0.0) ], [\"id\", \"text\", \"label\"])\r\n    tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol=\"text\", outputCol=\"words\")\r\n    hashingTF = HashingTF(inputCol=tokenizer.getOutputCol(), outputCol=\"features\")\r\n    lr = LogisticRegression(maxIter=10, regParam=0.001)\r\n    pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[tokenizer, hashingTF, lr])\r\n    model = pipeline.fit(training)\r\n    mlflow.spark.log_model(model, \"spark-model\")\r\n    \r\n    current_tags = mlflow.get_run(mlflow.active_run().info.run_id).data.tags\r\n    assert mlflow.utils.mlflow_tags.MLFLOW_LOGGED_MODELS in current_tags\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test.py\", line 27, in <module>\r\n    assert mlflow.utils.mlflow_tags.MLFLOW_LOGGED_MODELS in current_tags\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd model is not properly registered in the UI:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4659069/152795602-5ba6c23f-7ffa-452b-a178-9c7bc0d56432.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nI figured out the
