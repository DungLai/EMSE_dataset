Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.12.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nrun = mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=2)\r\nmlflow.log_metric('mymetric', 1323)\r\nmlflow.set_tag('set', 'test')\r\nexit()\r\nmlflow.end_run()\r\n```\r\nThis code produces a run with 'Status: FINISHED' where I would expect a Status: FAILED\r\n\r\nThe following code works correctly and produces a Status: FAILED:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=2) as run:\r\n    mlflow.log_metric('mymetric', 1323)\r\n    mlflow.set_tag('set', 'test')\r\n    exit()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nSee code above.
