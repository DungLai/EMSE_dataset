I can contribute this feature independently.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nCurrently we are able to log custom metrics while training a model using MLflow recipes. There is currently no easy way to log custom params outside of autologging ones. It would be great to log custom params as well or configure which params are logged from autologging. \n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nLog custom params while training a model\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nUsers would be able to pick and choose which params are logged instead of auto logged ones or also be able to add new custom params.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nCurrently the only way to achieve this is a grab the run_id and log params using it. Its an after step after training. So rather add a config similar to custom_metrics to make it easier to do it. \r\n\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [X] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
