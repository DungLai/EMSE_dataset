The section \"[Artifact Stores](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-stores)\" is a subsection of \"Tracking Servers\" and says \"In addition to local file paths ..\". Does it really support local file paths on the server? Am I hitting a bug>\r\n\r\nIf not, assuming that the client needs a network-type URI for artifact stores - should this section maybe not be _only_ in Tracking Servers but also in the Client docs? Currently I read it as if Artifact Stores can be configured inside Tracking Servers and then a client just takes `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` and that's it (as also [this](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1790#issuecomment-526050888) answer suggests) - it can log artifacts to the servers artifact store.","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
