We should also make sure to tell users that they can search for model versions by run ID using a search filter of the form `attributes.run_id IN ('run_id1', 'run_id2', ...)`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
