The server is running well, it logs metadata, and I can access the SFTP server remotely with a SSH key.\r\n\r\nThe SFTP server allows the users of the remote server to access it.\r\n\r\nOn my local machine I run the simple example file found in the doc to log some metrics and artifact, but I encountered a `Permission Denied` error as mlflow tries to save the artifacts in a local path (that does not exist) instead of using the remote SFTP server.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n**Launching tracking remote server**\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql://mlflow:mlflow@localhost/mlflow --default-artifact-root sftp://<remote_server_user>@localhost:/home/<remote_server_user>/mlflow/mlruns -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8000\r\n\r\n**local python code**\r\nI added the following environment variable \r\n```export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=\"http://<remote_server_ip>:8000```\r\n\r\nI also tried to add the following environment variable but it does not change anything\r\n```export MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI='sftp://<remote_server_user>@<remote_server_ip>:20'```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport mlflow\r\nfrom mlflow import log_metric, log_param, log_artifact, set_experiment, start_run\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    set_experiment(\"test\")\r\n    with start_run():\r\n        # Log a parameter (key-value pair)\r\n        log_param(\"param1\", 5)\r\n\r\n        # Log a metric;
