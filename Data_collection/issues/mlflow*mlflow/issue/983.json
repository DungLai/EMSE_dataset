For example, if you get a run from the `MlflowClient`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking.client import MlflowClient\r\nrun = MlflowClient().get_run('run-id')\r\n```\r\n\r\nits source name (e.g. the path of the script that was run) is accessed at:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrun.info.source_name\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding additional run metadata in this model is onerous, as the following need to be changed any time a new field is added:\r\n\r\n* The structure of the run model.\r\n* The protobuf files (which are used for run serialisation in tracking stores).\r\n* All implementations of tracking stores (three in the core library, but potentially more with #881).\r\n* The `MlflowClient` API.\r\n* The fluent tracking API.\r\n\r\nIt's therefore planned to migrate the following run attributes into tags:\r\n\r\n* `run.info.name` as the tag `mlflow.runName`\r\n* `run.info.source_type` as the tag `mlflow.source.type`\r\n* `run.info.source_name` as the tag `mlflow.source.name`\r\n* `run.info.entry_point_name` as the tag `mlflow.project.entryPoint`\r\n* `run.info.user_id` as the tag `mlflow.username`\r\n\r\n## Completed work\r\n\r\n* #926 Store run metadata in tags as well as attributes.\r\n* #930 Implement pluggable run context provider system.\r\n* #974 [bugfix] Correct an error in how the source type was set as a tag.\r\n* #1137 Restore parent_run_id argument to MlflowClient.create_run.\r\n\r\n## In progress / in review\r\n\r\n* #978 Remove run attributes from the arguments to `MlflowClient.create_run` that are expected to be passed as tags. `create_run` will instead read the removed arguments from tags and pass them to the store implementations for backwards compatibility.\r\n* #981 Set run name and parent run ID tags in fluent layer instead of in tracking store implementations.\r\n\r\n## Outstanding work\r\n\r\n* Remove `user_id` argument from `MlflowClient.create_run` and set as tag in default context provider (after #981).\r\n* Implement a Jupyter notebook `RunContextProvider`.\r\n* Add deprecation warnings / notices to run metadata attributes to discourage use during the transition.\r\n* Refactor tests of `mlflow.tracking.fluent` to avoid testing internal logic of `mlflow.tracking.context`\r\n* Do some refactoring in `mlflow.tracking.context` to 'bake in' some of the helper methods to their respective context providers (dependent on the previous bullet).\r\n* Update the R client to this logic (see discussion in #958). It probably makes sense to wait until the Python API is settled before doing this.\r\n* Investigate if changes to the Java client are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Later work (pre 1.0 release)\r\n\r\n* UI and other clients to read run metadata from tags instead of attributes.\r\n* Run metadata attributes to be removed.","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
