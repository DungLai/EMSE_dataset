There are some incompatibilities with python packages (because of the M1) but I managed to get them working. The Javascript and UI on the other hand, no matter what I've tried doesn't seem to work. Running the `npm install` results in the errors in attachment.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
