I would like to send an image, or generally, an array. I have looked in the doc but I have found no example.\r\n\r\nThis is how I created the model:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nimport torch.nn as nn\r\nfrom torchvision.models import alexnet\r\nfrom mlflow.pytorch import save_model\r\n\r\nmodel = alexnet(True)\r\nsave_model(model, './alexnet')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould I wrap my Pytorch model inside a function that accepts a `pd.DataFrame` with a column containing the image? In this case, what is the best way to encode the image?\r\n\r\nCan you show me an example code? \r\n\r\nAfter solving this issue I will be more than happy to include an example in the doc and the repo :)\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nFrancesco Saverio Zuppichini","closed_by":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
