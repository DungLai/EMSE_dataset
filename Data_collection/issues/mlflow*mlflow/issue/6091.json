And I do not want to use for loop to log the table because it is very slow. Is it possible to log a series of data into mlflow in one time?  \n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [X] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
