For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: `No`\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: `Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: `No`\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: `1.23.1`\r\n- **Python version**: `3.8.12`\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: `NA`\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow models serve -m \"models:/....\"`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen building an fastai model that returns multiple classes probabilities, you can successfully train and log the model using `mlflow.fastai` API. To run the given model, you can successfully use:\r\n\r\n`mlflow.fastai.load_model(....)`\r\n\r\nHowever, when using the flavor `pyfunc` or when serving the model (`mlflow models serve` uses the `pyfunc` flavor), if the model returns multiple probabilities (for instance 2), it results in the following exception being raised:\r\n\r\n`ValueError: 1 columns passed, passed data had 2 columns.`\r\n\r\nThis seems to be related with the implementation of `_FastaiModelWrapper`, which expects the model to return one single column of data:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass _FastaiModelWrapper:\r\n    def __init__(self, learner):\r\n        self.learner = learner\r\n\r\n    def predict(self, dataframe):\r\n        dl = self.learner.dls.test_dl(dataframe)\r\n        preds, _ = self.learner.get_preds(dl=dl)\r\n        return pd.DataFrame(map(np.array, preds.numpy()), columns=[\"predictions\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `pd.DataFrame` will iterate over the data structure, if the model returns multiple predictions (for instance, the probabilities of each class), then the number of columns won't match the shape of the data.\r\n\r\nOne way to avoid `pd.DataFrame` to parse the internal returned structure from the model is to construct a `pd.Series` instead of a `pd.DataFrame`, and then convert it to a `pd.DataFrame`. I propose to introduce the following change:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def predict(self, dataframe):\r\n        dl = self.learner.dls.test_dl(dataframe)\r\n        preds, _ = self.learner.get_preds(dl=dl)\r\n        return pd.Series(map(np.array, preds.numpy())).to_frame(\"predictions\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nThe following model will throw the error:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport torch\r\nimport fastai\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom fastai.vision.core import load_image\r\n\r\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\r\nfrom fastai.vision.data import ImageDataLoaders\r\n\r\npath = untar_data(URLs.DOGS, dest=\"/tmp/.fastai\") #fastai==2.4.1\r\nimage_files = get_image_files(path)\r\n\r\n## Loading the dataset\r\ndata_loader= ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path, item_tfms=Resize(224), batch_tfms=Normalize.from_stats(*imagenet_stats))\r\n\r\n## Building the model\r\nlearn = cnn_learner(data_loader, models.resnet34, metrics=accuracy)\r\nlearn.fine_tune(1, 0.6e-3)\r\n\r\n## Try the model\r\nsample_img = load_image(image_files[1])\r\ndl_model = learn.dls.test_dl([np.array(sample_img)])\r\nreal_preds, _ = learn.get_preds(dl=dl_model)\r\n\r\n## Log the model\r\nfrom mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature\r\n\r\nsignature = infer_signature(np.array(sample_img), real_preds.detach().numpy())\r\nmlflow.fastai.log_model(learn, \"model\", signature=signature, registered_model_name=\"cats_vs_dogs\")\r\n\r\n## Load the model using pyfunc\r\nmlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\"models:/cats_vs_dogs/1\")\r\nmiflow.pyfunc.predict(np.array(sample_img))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
