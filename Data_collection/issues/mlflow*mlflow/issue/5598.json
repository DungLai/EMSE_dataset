Motivation\r\n\r\nWe frequently construct an `MlflowException` instance with `error_code=INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow.exceptions from MlflowException\r\nfrom mlflow.protos.databricks_pb2 import INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE\r\n\r\nraise MlflowException(\r\n    \"error message\",\r\n    error_code=INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we had a class method `invalid_parameter_value`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MlflowException(...):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def invalid_parameter_value(cls, message, **kwargs):\r\n        return cls(message, error_code=INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe could simplify the code above to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow.exceptions from MlflowException\r\n\r\nraise MlflowException.invalid_parameter_value(\"error message\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is shorter and has fewer import statements.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- We don't need to replace existing `MlflowException(\"error message\",error_code=INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE)` for now (we may in the future).","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
