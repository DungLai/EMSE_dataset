I can use the `mlflow sagemaker build-and-push-container` to create the base image and then create another image with some custom python packages installed. However the default behavior when serving the pyfunc is to activate a conda environment inside the container (unless an environment variable is specified) which prevents the model from accessing the system dependencies. https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/bbf8886a2cbf4fa371f0a67157fdd3df3dfa47dd/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py#L121\r\n\r\nIn the custom image I create I can get around the conda env creation by adding \r\n```\r\nENV MLFLOW_DISABLE_ENV_CREATION=true\r\n```\r\nHowever, I think this line reveals a bug if the conda env is not created \r\n\r\nI think this line should be removed or moved inside the above `if` block https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/30a90ec9cbffa5c0d0212368b9f2a7e8c8a3fc81/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py#L127\r\n\r\nsince if the conda creation happens, it will be activated here https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/30a90ec9cbffa5c0d0212368b9f2a7e8c8a3fc81/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py#L106\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n- run `mlflow sagemaker build-and-push-container`\r\n- build another container\r\n```\r\nFROM <container generated from first step>\r\n\r\nENV MLFLOW_DISABLE_ENV_CREATION=true\r\n```\r\n- Serve the model on sagemaker `mlflow sagemaker deploy ...`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nWhen running the container, you should see this in the cloudwatch logs\r\n`Could not find conda environment: custom_env`\r\n\r\n### Edit\r\nIt looks like it was intentionally called out in this PR https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/1329. I still think its strange to activate the conda environment twice (especially if its specified to not create one).\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
