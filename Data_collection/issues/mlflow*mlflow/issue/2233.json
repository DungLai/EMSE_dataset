Verifying the source code (mlflow/data.py) I noticed the functionality was expanded to support GCS on #1168.\r\n\r\nOn #1011 the ability to store artifacts in an HDFS was implemented and it included a feature to download artifacts from the [HdfsArtifactRepository](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py).\r\n\r\nSo, there is no much impact on including this functionality because downloading from HDFS is already supported.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nAbility to store files on a HDFS and execute programs that can only read local files.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nInclude hdfs scheme to [download_uri](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/data.py)) reusing the code for parsing the URI and the environment variables from [HdfsArtifactRepository](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
