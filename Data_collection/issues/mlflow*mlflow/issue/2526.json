Storing artifacts during runs works, but if I select an artifact in the mlflow UI the error \"something went wrong\" without any further information is displayed. \r\nAlso the console output from mlflow ui does not contain any further information.\r\nI had a look on similar issues in this forum, but the soultions proposed there did not work for me.  I would be very grateful for any suggestions as to what might be wrong here.
