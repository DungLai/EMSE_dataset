I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\n\n### MLflow version\n\nVERSION = \"2.0.2.dev0\"\r\n\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS M1 12.03\r\n- **Python version**: 3.10\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nUnable to build documentation because of **python=3.10** & **sphinx==3.5.4** incompatibility. The issue [has been fixed](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/9513) in the later versions of sphinx starting from `4.*.*`. Sphinx version can be updated in order to avoid this issue in future.\r\n\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```bash\r\ncd docs\r\nmake livehtml\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\n\r\n```shell\r\n> make livehtml                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       master [0b5269ee]\r\n# Remove `--keep-going` option because `sphinx-autobuild` doesn't support it and raises an error.\r\n# See: https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild/blob/master/src/sphinx_autobuild/build.py#L7\r\nsphinx-autobuild -b html -d build/doctrees -W  -n -T source build/html\r\n[sphinx-autobuild] > sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees -n -W -T /Users/rustem.galiullin/Projects/mlflow-dev/docs/source /Users/rustem.galiullin/Projects/mlflow-dev/docs/build/html\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/rustem.galiullin/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-dev/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 196, in _run_module_as_main\r\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\r\n  File \"/Users/rustem.galiullin/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-dev/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 86, in _run_code\r\n    exec(code, run_globals)\r\n  File \"/Users/rustem.galiullin/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-dev/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sphinx/__main__.py\", line 13, in <module>\r\n    from sphinx.cmd.build import main\r\n  File \"/Users/rustem.galiullin/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-dev/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sphinx/cmd/build.py\", line 25, in <module>\r\n    from sphinx.application import Sphinx\r\n  File \"/Users/rustem.galiullin/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-dev/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sphinx/application.py\", line 32, in <module>\r\n    from sphinx.config import Config\r\n  File \"/Users/rustem.galiullin/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-dev/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sphinx/config.py\", line 23, in <module>\r\n    from sphinx.util import logging\r\n  File \"/Users/rustem.galiullin/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-dev/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sphinx/util/__init__.py\", line 35, in <module>\r\n    from sphinx.util import smartypants  #
