We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @jinzhang21 in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\nYes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\nArchLinux\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\nUnknown\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n3.7.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n-\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\nClick on a metrics link from a run overview page.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nTrying to plot some metrics using the web interface results in a Something went wrong error page.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nNot needed\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThis error is logged in the javascript console:\r\n`Uncaught TypeError: \"e.value.toFixed is not a function\"`\r\n\r\nWhen I put a breakpoint in the javascript UI `render` function and do an inspection I get the following:\r\n```\r\n>>> this.props.metrics[0].history[0][\"value\"]\r\n465.9117431640625\r\n>>> this.props.metrics[0].history[3][\"value\"]\r\n\"8.194174265635981e+20\"\r\n```\r\nNote the type is a string in the second output. I believe this to be the problem because `\"some string\".toFixed(5)` gives the same error (`Uncaught TypeError: \"some string\".toFixed is not a function`)\r\n\r\nIf a look at the MLFlow API request response from `http://192.168.130.110:5001/ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/metrics/get-history?run_uuid=e409f89d35714f4bb3f2897db5ffe0c1&metric_key=val_loss` it looks like the following:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"metrics\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"val_loss\",\r\n      \"value\": 465.9117431640625,\r\n      \"timestamp\": \"1603356692187\",\r\n      \"step\": \"0\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"val_loss\",\r\n      \"value\": 1503.7987060546875,\r\n      \"timestamp\": \"1603359627609\",\r\n      \"step\": \"1\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"val_loss\",\r\n      \"value\": 8566823372980224.0,\r\n      \"timestamp\": \"1603362580753\",\r\n      \"step\": \"2\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"val_loss\",\r\n      \"value\": 8.194174265635981e+20,\r\n      \"timestamp\": \"1603365524015\",\r\n      \"step\": \"3\"\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the error seems to be caused by the client side is not able to parse the API responses proberly.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3586/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
