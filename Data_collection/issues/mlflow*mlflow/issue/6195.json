Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nNo. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue\r\n\r\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-stores\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing)\r\n\r\nI wanted to link to what an “MLflow model URI” could be in a design doc, and searched for it in MLflow docs. It looks like we don’t actually describe supported model URIs except in [CLI docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#cmdoption-mlflow-azureml-build-image-m) which say\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequired URI to the model. A local path, a 'runs:/' URI, or a remote storage URI (e.g., an 's3://' URI). For more information about supported remote URIs for model artifacts, see https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-stores\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the [linked artifacts doc page ](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-stores)doesn’t say anything about `models:/` URIs. Currently, it looks like we document `models:/` URIs in the model registry page: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#fetching-an-mlflow-model-from-the-model-registry.\r\n\r\nTo address this, one idea is to document model registry `models:/` artifact storage and `runs:/` artifact storage in https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-stores. We could also add a more explicit section documenting `models:/` URIs in the model registry doc page and link to it from the tracking page","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
