Users extend a base class and override method(s) to define the behavior of their model. \r\n\r\nWhen PyTorch saves the model subclass via [torch.save](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.save), it uses the standard Python pickle library. This library does not capture the class definition itself; therefore, the model cannot be reloaded in a a new context unless the class is re-defined or imported.\r\n\r\nOur current `mlflow.pytorch.save_model` and `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` APIs do not provide a mechanism for persisting the class definition with the saved model. I've also tried using `cloudpickle` as the serialization module by specifying the `pickle_module` parameter of [torch.save](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.save). However, this does not seem to solve the deserialization problem.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nStep 1: Log a model using the following code from our own `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` example snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# X data\r\nx_data = torch.Tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])\r\n# Y data with its expected value: labels\r\ny_data = torch.Tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])\r\n# Partial Model example modified from Sung Kim\r\n# https://github.com/hunkim/PyTorchZeroToAll\r\nclass MyPyTorchModel(torch.nn.Module):\r\n   def __init__(self):\r\n      super(MyPyTorchModel, self).__init__()\r\n      self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(1, 1)  # One in and one out\r\n   def forward(self, x):\r\n       y_pred = self.linear(x)\r\n       return y_pred\r\n# our model\r\npytorch_model = MyPyTorchModel()\r\ncriterion = torch.nn.MSELoss(size_average=False)\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.SGD(pytorch_model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\r\n# Training loop\r\nfor epoch in range(500):\r\n   # Forward pass: Compute predicted y by passing x to the model\r\n   y_pred = pytorch_model(x_data)\r\n   # Compute and print loss\r\n   loss = criterion(y_pred, y_data)\r\n   print(epoch, loss.data[0])\r\n   #Zero gradients, perform a backward pass, and update the weights.\r\n   optimizer.zero_grad()\r\n   loss.backward()\r\n   optimizer.step()\r\n# After training\r\nfor hv in [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]:\r\n    hour_var = torch.Tensor([[hv]])\r\n    y_pred = pytorch_model(hour_var)\r\n    print(\"predict (after training)\",  hv, y_pred.data[0][0])\r\n# log the model\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n  mlflow.log_param(\"epochs\", 500)\r\n  mlflow.pytorch.log_model(pytorch_model, \"pytorch_model\", pickle_module=cloudpickle, pickle_protocol=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In a new Python session, load the model using `mlflow.pytorch.load_model`. \r\n\r\n3.
