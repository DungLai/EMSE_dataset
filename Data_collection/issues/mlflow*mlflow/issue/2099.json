We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label. Items tagged with the `needs design` label are awaiting a design sketch from an MLflow maintainer: @harupy.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @harupy in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Describe the proposal\r\nAutomatically update MLflow metric plots for in-progress runs periodically, enabling users to track the performance of in-progress runs without having to perform periodic page refreshes and reset UI state.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIt would be great to be able to monitor training progress via metric graphs for a particular set of runs.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nCurrently when i plot a chart say for loss of an in-progress run, the MLflow UI creates a snapshot of the current status of the training. However the chart will not automatically update with new data. The browser must be manually refreshed in order to display updated data. However, updating the chart causes certain plot state & settings to be lost.","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2099/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
