Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nI have logged a tensorflow model in 'savedModel' format (directory of 'assets', 'variables' and .pb file).  I have also registered this model via the 'register model' button in the tracking UI.  I would like to download this model (the entire directory of files: assets, variables, .pb file).  However, I don't see any obvious way to do this.  I don't see any download option in the model registry UI, and the download option in the tracking UI is only available for individual files.  When I select a directory, the download icon is not visible, only the 'register model' icon is available.  How can I download a logged model / or directory of logged artifacts?   \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nShare logged models with other team members via downloading models from mlflow UI \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nI had assumed this would be basic functionality.  The mlflow UI can facilitate communication between teams (e.g. modeling & deployment).  However, if the deployment team can't download models directly from the mlflow UI, additional workflows need to be established outside of mlflow.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nThe feature is needed to support deployment of models on edge devices by specific team members who have access to these devices.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nIt is apparently not possible to download a directory of artifacts (e.g. a tensorflow savedModel) via the UI.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nCurrent [UI implementation](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0f7393ec90745864b2beba9f91f684647c10e99d/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/ArtifactView.js#L96-L100) only renders download link if selected artifact is a file.  When you select a directory, model registry button is rendered.  But model registry doesn't support model download. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2978/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
