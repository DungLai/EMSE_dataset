Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n  - Start server: `mlflow models serve -m runs:/5f8aee52fcb442388368af4da658b398/model --no-conda`\r\n  -  Submit an inference request: `curl -i -X POST -d \"{\\\"data\\\":0.0199132142]}\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:5000/invocations`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nSubmitting an inference requests to the MLFlow model server with invalid content returns HTTP error 500 'Internal Server Error' instead of HTTP error 400 'Bad Request'. This prevents proper error handling on the client side and blocks REST API fuzzing.\r\n\r\nEx:\r\n```\r\ncurl -i -X POST -d \"{\\\"data\\\":0.0199132142]}\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:5000/invocations\r\nHTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR\r\nContent-Length: 901\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nDate: Wed, 13 Oct 2021 22:16:44 GMT\r\nServer: mlflow\r\n\r\n{\"error_code\": \"MALFORMED_REQUEST\", \"message\": \"Failed to parse input from JSON.
