Run Tensorflow training, and log the model using `mlflow.tensorflow.log_saved_model`, and here's the model structure in my GCS:\r\n```\r\n(rr-minist-tf) ip-10-10-180-19:src arinto$ gsutil ls -r  gs://arinto-dev/0\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/:\r\n\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/:\r\n\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/artifacts/:\r\n\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/artifacts/model/:\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/artifacts/model/MLmodel\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/artifacts/model/saved_model.pb\r\n\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/artifacts/model/variables/:\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/artifacts/model/variables/variables.data-00000-of-00001\r\ngs://arinto-dev/0/a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605/artifacts/model/variables/variables.index\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Then I want to serve the saved model using this command, but it fails. Error logs in the Source code/logs\r\n`mlflow pyfunc serve -m model -r a0467cfc4a904ad894cb4793dde73605 -p 5001`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nIt seems that mlflow can't download the `variables` folder properly. I suspect there could be bugs in `GCSArtifactRepository` i.e it works fine for model without nested directory like sklearn, but not for Tensorflow (which has nested directory).  I haven't had chance to deep dive yet, and for now I'll raise this issue. \r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/arinto/anaconda3/envs/rr-minist-tf/bin/mlflow\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    load_entry_point('mlflow', 'console_scripts', 'mlflow')()\r\n  File \"/Users/arinto/anaconda3/envs/rr-minist-tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 722, in __call__\r\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/arinto/anaconda3/envs/rr-minist-tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 697, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File \"/Users/arinto/anaconda3/envs/rr-minist-tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1066, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File \"/Users/arinto/anaconda3/envs/rr-minist-tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1066, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File \"/Users/arinto/anaconda3/envs/rr-minist-tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 895, in invoke\r\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n  File \"/Users/arinto/anaconda3/envs/rr-minist-tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 535, in invoke\r\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Volumes/tvlk-repo/github/mlflow/mlflow/pyfunc/cli.py\", line 31, in serve\r\n    model_path = _get_model_log_dir(model_path, run_id)\r\n  File \"/Volumes/tvlk-repo/github/mlflow/mlflow/tracking/__init__.py\", line 345, in _get_model_log_dir\r\n    return artifact_repo.download_artifacts(model_name)\r\n  File \"/Volumes/tvlk-repo/github/mlflow/mlflow/store/artifact_repo.py\", line 270, in download_artifacts\r\n    return self._download_artifacts_into(artifact_path, tmp.path())\r\n  File \"/Volumes/tvlk-repo/github/mlflow/mlflow/store/artifact_repo.py\", line 281, in _download_artifacts_into\r\n    self._download_artifacts_into(file_info.path, local_path)\r\n  File \"/Volumes/tvlk-repo/github/mlflow/mlflow/store/artifact_repo.py\", line 286, in _download_artifacts_into\r\n    gcs_bucket.get_blob(remote_path).download_to_filename(local_path)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'download_to_filename'.\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"arinto","id":1780348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODAzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto","html_url":"https://github.com/arinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
