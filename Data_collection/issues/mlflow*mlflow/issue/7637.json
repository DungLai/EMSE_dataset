I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### MLflow version\r\n\r\n- Client: 2.1.1\r\n- Tracking server: 2.1.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS and elementary OS 6.1 JÃ³lnir, but we are launching the UI container though the official docker image\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen a new model is logged in MLflow, and we try to access it through the experiments page, an error is raised\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the
