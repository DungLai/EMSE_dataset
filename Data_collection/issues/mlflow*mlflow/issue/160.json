This makes sense when training e.g. Neural Networks and you want to log performance after multiple iterations. \r\n\r\nIt makes less sense when logging different metric values from different Cross Validation folds, which I think are logical to log under the same run. In this use-case it would be more beneficial to display the average metric value. \r\n\r\nBoth ways have merit, so if there could be a toggle somewhere to change between these two options that would be perfect.
