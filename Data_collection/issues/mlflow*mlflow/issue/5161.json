Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nhttps://www.randori.com/blog/cve-2021-44228/\r\n\r\nCritical vulnerability found using the java log4j-core library.\r\nAny versions <2.15 are vulnerable.\r\nCurrently the MLFlow scoring server creates a Java app that uses \r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>slf4j-jdk14</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\nWhich is a wrapper around the log4j library. \r\n\r\nWe did some digging and found that the java app only gets started if you use the `mleap` model flavor here https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py#L76\r\n\r\nI think what would be nice is to have the option of building different docker images from the start that only include the dependencies you need. In our usage, we are removing all the java dependencies from the image here https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/models/docker_utils.py#L18, and disabling the `mleap` code.\r\n\r\nFor people that do use the `mleap` scoring server though, is there any guidance on how we can update this dependency to force a current version of `log4j-core`?\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nI think this affects more than just the scoring, its areas that use the Java apps located in `mlflow/mlflow/java/*`. This seems to only affect `mleap` model flavors.\r\n\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5161/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
