But if I try to launch it with mlflow run\r\nI get this error\r\n`mlflow.exceptions.RestException: RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST: Run '744b34adb6174fd2bae34b67aaae93a0' not found`\r\n\r\nThis is because mlflow run creates a run locally and not on the tracking server. (Although i configured mlflow in the script to use my server as the backend).\r\n\r\nThe only way of making it work is to set manually MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI *before* running mlflow run. And so the mlflow.set_tracking_uri becomes useless.\r\n\r\nIs this supposed to be a normal behaviour? \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nIn main.py\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://127.0.0.1:5000')\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    mlflow.log_metric('mse', 0.80)\r\n```\r\nI launch the server with the following command, and I can visualize the UI properly.\r\n```\r\nmlflow server -h 127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created an MLproject.yml with \r\n```yaml\r\nname: TestModel\r\nentry_points:\r\n  main:\r\n    command: \"python main.py\"\r\n```\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow run .\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
