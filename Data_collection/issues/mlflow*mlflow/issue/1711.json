This will be similar and build off of kubernetes support in release 1.1.0. Once complete will add to the CLI the command: \r\n\r\n`mlflow run <project_uri> --backend azure --backend-config azure_config.json`\r\n\r\nwhere the `backend-config` is of the form:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"subscription-id\": \"b1c23f06-f9b5-4ccb-8a65-a8cb3dcd6a5a\",\r\n   \"resource-group\": \"myResourceGroup\",\r\n   \"workspace-name\": \"myWorkspaceName\",\r\n   \"aml-compute\": {\r\n     \"name\": \"cpu-compute\",\r\n     \"max-nodes\": 4,\r\n     \"vm-size\": \"Standard_D4_v2\",\r\n     \"vm-priority\": \"dedicated\",\r\n     \"retian-cluster\": false\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nExternal compute resources are very important to ML training. This will expand the functionality to the second largest cloud provider. It will also further solidify and develop the remote execution backend.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n\r\n- modify CLI for projects to accept `azure` as a backend\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1711/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
