But when it comes to chart, I cope with some minor problems. When saving the train and test errors, I want to put those numbers in the same chart, but I couldn't figure out how to do it.\r\n\r\nHere what I've been trying:\r\n\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        for error in log_loss_error_list_of_train_set:\r\n            mlflow.log_metric(\"log_loss_train\", error)\r\n        for error in log_loss_error_list_of_test_set:\r\n            mlflow.log_metric(\"log_loss_test\", error)`\r\n\r\nIt worked but it's not exactly what I'm looking for. It creates 2 separate charts.\r\nSo, is there any way that I can put the 2 list numbers in 1 chart ?\r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
