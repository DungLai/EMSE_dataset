I would like a feature that allows me to view them overlaid on the same axes in the UI, without exporting the data and plotting it myself\r\n\r\nC/p from the slack chat:\r\nmani   [1 day ago]\r\nThis is a great idea. Current design for the UI does not have a mechanism to choose multiple plot lines. To add this feature--there would be some design work needed. For now the easiest way, as you mentioned would be to use APIs to get metric history, and plot those.\r\n\r\nmani   [1 day ago]\r\nWe will consider adding this feature.
