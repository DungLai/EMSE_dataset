Feature requests that are likely to be accepted:\r\n* Are minimal in scope (note that it's always easier to add additional functionality later than remove functionality)\r\n\r\nRight now in lots of machine learning training scenarios, there will be some dedicated training platform with GPU clusters to be able to run training job, and most those platforms have some resource provision/training job submission process via docker image/ condo env, so it won't need to have MLproject to manage the conda env/docker image. instead, after docker is initialized, MLproject can manage the workflow inside docker, like ETL, normalization, training, etc. so wonder is it possible to omit the conda/docker env set up in MLproject and just execute the workflow\r\n\r\n\r\n* Have user impact & value that justifies the maintenance burden of supporting the feature moving forwards. The [JQuery contributor guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/open-source/#contributing-something-new) has an excellent discussion on this.\r\n\r\nIt will have minimum change compared with current MLproject, so just ignore the conda env or docker image. and execute the workflow directly\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nWhat is the use case in mind?  Why is it valuable to support, and why is it currently difficult or impossible to achieve? Could the desired functionality alternatively be implemented as a third-party package using MLflow public APIs? \r\n\r\nto use MLproject workflow to manage the machine learning training cycle inside initialized docker/conda environment. currently if we omit the conda/docker, it will still initialize some default conda/docker inside already started image(which is not necessary).","closed_by":{"login":"zhangruiskyline","id":1103731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDM3MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1103731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangruiskyline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
