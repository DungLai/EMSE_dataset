I have mlflow==1.4.0, boto3==1.10.28 and botocore==1.13.28. The ideia is having a remote server on ec2 and persiste experiment artifaxcts on S3. From my local machine I do: mlflow run sklearn_elasticnet_wine (the example in mlflow repo), having MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI env variable set to point to my ec2 instance. Everithing works fine, it runs successfuly, artifacts are stored in S3. The problem is when I access the UI and select a specific run the server send an exception:\r\n\r\n`2019/11/27 19:26:44 ERROR mlflow.server: Exception on
