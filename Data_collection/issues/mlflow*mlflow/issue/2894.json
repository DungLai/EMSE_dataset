Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:  Source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.6.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.3\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n```\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name='example of bad metrics'):\r\n    for i in range(10):\r\n        mlflow.log_metric('quality', i*0.5, step=i)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWith the above code, the first metric value (0) is shown in the UI, not the last (5). This should be the last so when comparing multiple runs, you can compare how the \"final\" models performed.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nAs above\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [X ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2894/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
