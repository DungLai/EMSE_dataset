Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\nFiling this issue to enable discussion :) - happy to help contribute/review contributions once we've settled on a solution\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe current `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` API uses a custom pickle pickle module (based on cloudpickle) to save models, which can cause failures when saving certain types of models. For example, it's currently not possible to log the model in our [Pytorch example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7479f3518ffaf37e656e1505372e40655e936b90/examples/pytorch/mnist_tensorboard_artifact.py) (see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2581), which uses unpicklable APIs from the third-party tensorboardX module to log metrics.\r\n\r\nWe should investigate alternative approaches for persisting pytorch models that avoid this class of issue, e.g. new Pytorch APIs for zipfile based serialization. We might also consider recommending use of torchscript (there's WIP support for a torchscript flavor in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2662) for persisting torch models with MLflow\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
