Since Novermber 2019, SageMaker has come up with something called multi-model endpoint, which allows users to deploy multiple models to the same instance.\r\n\r\nOne can read about multi-model endpoint here : https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/save-on-inference-costs-by-using-amazon-sagemaker-multi-model-endpoints/\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nMulti Model Endpoint can decrease cost tremendously for organizations, by deploying multiple models to one single instance. SageMaker handles the rest, of swapping inactive models with new models whose traffic is incoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nProbably in the `mlflow.sagemaker` API?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2736/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2736/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
