I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.30.0\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux\r\n- **Python version**: 3.10\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nWhen attempting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.start_run(run_name=\"test\")\r\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"test-model\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the past we would get the artifact directory with the name \"test-model\" and then the run would be called \"test\" this has stopped working as can be seen in our server UI but also with this run above still active we run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun = mlflow.active_run()\r\nrun.to_dictionary()\r\n``` \r\n\r\nand get the output:\r\n```\r\n{'info': {'artifact_uri': 's3://REDACTED',\r\n  'end_time': None,\r\n  'experiment_id': '2',\r\n  'lifecycle_stage': 'active',\r\n  'run_id': '77cabe987a7b41c7911b25aa011c5116',\r\n  'run_name': '',\r\n  'run_uuid': '77cabe987a7b41c7911b25aa011c5116',\r\n  'start_time': 1666976925457,\r\n  'status': 'RUNNING',\r\n  'user_id': 'root'},\r\n 'data': {'metrics': {},\r\n  'params': {},\r\n  'tags': {'mlflow.user': 'root',\r\n   'mlflow.source.name': '/shared-libs/python3.10/py-core/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py',\r\n   'mlflow.source.type': 'LOCAL'}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you can see that the run_id has been auto-generated but the explicit run_name ignored. I am sure we can find a workaround but thought you might like to know about this bug or lack of backward compatibility. \n\n### Tracking information\n\n1.30.0\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets load_iris\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nX, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\r\nmodel = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"test_name\")\r\n\tmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"test_model\")\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\nIt doesn't raise an error since it's a lack of backward compatibility \n\n### Other info / logs\n\n```python\r\nrun = mlflow.active_run()\t\r\nprint(run.to_dictionary()['info']['run_name'])\r\n```\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"dtpryce","id":2737000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzcwMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2737000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/dtpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
