I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n- Client: 2.0.1\r\n- Tracking server: 2.0.1\r\n\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution**: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.10\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nI just recently updated to MLflow version 2.0.1. I tried to run my training as usual running `mlflow run . --experiment-name \"Name\" ...` using a MLproject with a Docker environment. Sadly it returns:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3: can't open file 'scripts/run_experiment.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis didn't happen in the previous version of MLflow and I tried downgrading the version and it runs smoothly. Seems like my docker container does not have my training scripts and so the training can't be executed.\r\n\r\nMaybe I missed some changes in the MLproject and CLI commands and now I should link the volume to my docker container.\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nMy file structure is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot_directory\r\n      |---scripts\r\n      |         |--files.py\r\n      |         |--\r\n      |\r\n      |---MLproject\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue just try to run something using the run command. I tried two types of trainings and both failed.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow run . --experiment-name \"Experiment name\" \\\r\n    -P ... \\\r\n    -P ... \\\r\n    -A gpus=all \\\r\n    -A network=host\n\n### Stack trace\n\nSome parts of the stack trace are indicated as `[a bunch of commands]` for privacy purpose\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n2022/12/15 10:49:57 INFO mlflow.projects.docker: registry.cinfo.es/ai-mlflow-experiments/mlflow-darknet-experiment/experiment:latest already exists\r\n2022/12/15 10:49:57 INFO mlflow.projects.utils: === Created directory /tmp/tmpezlbdz06 for downloading remote URIs passed to arguments of type 'path' ===\r\n2022/12/15 10:49:57 INFO mlflow.projects.backend.local: === Running command 'docker run --rm --gpus all --network host --tty -e [a bunch of commands] registry.cinfo.es/ai-mlflow-experiments/mlflow-darknet-experiment/experiment:latest python3 scripts/run_experiment.py [a bunch of commands(again)] in run with ID '819450cd379e4b1c9992ad62b112a229' === \r\npython3: can't open file 'scripts/run_experiment.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\r\n```\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
