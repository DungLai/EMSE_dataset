If you have some models or datasets anywhere in the project structure - they're also copied, which makes the new image huge and the command execution really slow. To avoid it you should be able to create `.dockerignore` file, but it just doesn't work - there's no difference in the result regardless of whether the file exists or not. When running similar flow, but without mlflow - just with custom `docker build`, there's no problem and `.dockerignore` is respected.\r\n\r\nPS The file was created in the project's root folder - so in the same place, where `MLproject` file is stored.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2016/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
