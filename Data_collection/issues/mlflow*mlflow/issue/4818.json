Currently, the `mlflow.tensorflow` model flavor does not provide a friendly interface for saving `tf.keras` models in MLflow format, and the inference input / output format for pyfunc representations of `tf.keras` models is also difficult to use. Finally, users often experience confusion about which module to use with Keras models in MLflow: `mlflow.keras` or `mlflow.tensorflow`. \r\n\r\nWe propose that:\r\n\r\n1. Users should be able to save tf.keras models in SavedModel format via the `mlflow.tensorflow.log_model` and `mlflow.tensorflow.save_model` APIs.\r\n\r\n2. The pyfunc representation of a tf.keras model should use the same input / output interface that is currently in place for models saved from the `mlflow.keras` module.\r\n\r\n3. The `mlflow.keras` module should be deprecated in favor of the `mlflow.tensorflow` module.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Unifying the tf.Keras model experience in MLflow and removing model persistence and inference format pitfalls will improve the usability of this part of the platform.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Many MLflow users leverage tf.keras for model development.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Many Databricks users leverage tf.keras for model development.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? There is no clear guidance for which module to use when saving / deploying tf.keras models in MLflow. `mlflow.keras` and `mlflow.tensorflow` behave differently.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4818/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
