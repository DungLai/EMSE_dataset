I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.28.0\n\n### System information\n\n- Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- Python 3.9.0\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nNOTE: This BUG references #4830 due to the similar behavior.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a bug in the CLI vs API configuration.\r\nScenario 1:\r\nYou have `main.py` that has `set_experiment` function call. Example:\r\n`mlflow.set_experiment(\"my-experiment\")`\r\nRunning the file using `python main.py` will correctly run and set the experiment.\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nYou have `main.py` that has `set_tracking_uri`. Example:\r\n`mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://localhost:5000\")`\r\nRunning the file using `python main.py` will correctly run and set the tracking url.\r\n\r\nScenario 3:\r\nUsing the same file in Scenario 1:\r\nRunning the file using `mlflow run /path/to/project` will give an error\r\n```\r\nCannot start run with ID {} because active run ID does not match environment run ID. Make sure --experiment-name or --experiment-id matches experiment set with set_experiment(), or just use command-line\r\n```\r\nRunning the file using `mlflow run /path/to/project --experiment-name my-experiment` works.\r\nWe note from this Scenario that there is an override happening here where the CLI's default experiment name `Default` is overriding the python API call to `set_experiment`. Usually CLI commands should override the code, but in this scenario the CLI command was NOT passed, therefore the API should override.\r\n\r\nScenario 4:\r\nUsing the same file as Scenario 2:\r\nRunning the file using `mlflow run /path/to/project/` will give an error\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.RestException: RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST: Run with id={} not found\r\n```\r\nThere is no CLI argument to pass the tracking_uri therefore this scenario will NEVER work, thus creating a huge bug in the API. Current workaround envolves the use of environment variables, but this behavior completely eliminates the API `set_tracking_uri` as it simply cannot be used.\r\n\r\nPotential fixes include either giving the API higher priority over the CLI (with a warning that CLI and API override) or to add a parameter `tracking-uri` to the `run` command to allow user to pass tracking URI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have added tracking uri to the cli as a proposed fix for Scenario 4 (but not 3 as that requires major changes to the API). The fix is found as PR #6518\r\n\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nSee above\n\n### Stack trace\n\nSee above\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [X] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [X] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [x] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
