Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10, WSL2\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: PyPI\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: n/a\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run .\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\nUsing a Win10/WSL2/docker setup, the container mount path to the artifact store is incorrect. From the logs:\r\n\r\n2021/09/29 10:41:52 INFO mlflow.projects.backend.local: === Running command 'docker run --rm -v C:\\Users\\jacobss\\gitlab\\test-mlflow-project\\mlruns:/mlflow/tmp/mlruns -v C:\\Users\\jacobss\\gitlab\\test-mlflow-project\\mlruns\\0\\2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce\\artifacts:C:\\Users\\jacobss\\gitlab\\test-mlflow-project\\mlruns\\0\\2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce\\artifacts -e MLFLOW_RUN_ID=2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=file:///mlflow/tmp/mlruns -e MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID=0 mlflow-experiments:6432e77 bash ./main.sh' in run with ID '2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce' ===\r\n\r\nSo the first volume mount (of mlruns) is fine, but the second one has windows paths for both the source path (correct) and the destination path (incorrect).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
