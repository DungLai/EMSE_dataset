Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.18.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5` or `mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5 --backend kubernetes --backend-config kubernetes_config.json`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nI work on my company laptop which may be the reason this bug happened. I have been trying to use MLflow projects in Docker environment or with Kubernetes as backend. However when I try to run it, it produces `PermissionError`. The error is produced whenever MLflow tries to remove the temp directory it created in `_create_docker_build_ctx`  function. this is the exact line that produces the error https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/221fedc81679bd23fc68b2cb769b07ce5e8fe9f1/mlflow/projects/docker.py#L117\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nClone MLflow repository and try to run the docker container with the following commands:\r\n\r\n- `mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5` \r\n-  `mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5 --backend kubernetes --backend-config kubernetes_config.json`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n>  Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n> \r\n>   File \"c:\\users\\xx\\anaconda3\\envs\\mlflow-projects\\lib\\runpy.py\", line 193, in
