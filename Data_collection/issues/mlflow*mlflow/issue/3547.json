Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ X ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Databricks runtime 7.1 and 7.3, also 7.3ML, as far as i know  Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS. \r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Installed by pip MLflow\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)** :mlflow, version 1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.7.5\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.start_run()\r\nmlflow.log_param(\"featuresCol\", \"features\")\r\nmlflow.log_param(\"predictionCol\", \"prediction\")\r\nmlflow.log_param(\"maxBins\", \"38\")\r\n\r\nlr = GBTRegressor(featuresCol='features',labelCol='ligeros_total', predictionCol='prediction', maxBins=38)\r\n\r\n# # Fit the model\r\nlrModel = lr.fit(train)\r\n\r\nmlflow.spark.log_model(lrModel, \"Model name\")\r\n\r\nmlflow.end_run()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe expected behaviour was that the log_model directive would save the artifact in the MLflow server and reflect it in the models UI that works in databricks, this process works correctly with the databricks 6.4 runtime, right now the problem is that when running the code snipped above it stays in a constant execution  with the message \" determining location of dbio file fragments \" that seems to describe a message about delta cache regarding the table information as i understand it. It shows in the experiments tabs and the run experiments list in the UI, but  there are no artifacts recorded, it also stays in an \"UNFINISHED\" status for the run because the end_run never gets executed, this last thing can be forced but the artifact still won't appear. This may be related to the MLflow version, or something related to the system it runs in but are there are no error messages i am at a loss on how to proceed. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ X ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ X ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ X ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n\r\nInterface \r\nDatabricks\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ X ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
