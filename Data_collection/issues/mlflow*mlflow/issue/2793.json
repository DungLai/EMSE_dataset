Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix\r\nfor this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04 (host), nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:19.12-py3 (container)\r\n\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary(pip install mlflow)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.5 (host), 3.6 (container)\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n```\r\nMLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=MY_URL AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-east-1 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=MY_KEY AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=MY_ACCESS_KEY mlflow run mlflow_test_torch -A gpus=all\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nmlflow is able to propagate MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to the docker container but not the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION. This causes boto3 error when the training script tries to log artifact to S3 as AWS region is not set.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.pytorch.log_model(model_ft, \"models\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/boto3/s3/transfer.py\", line 279, in upload_file\r\n    future.result()\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/futures.py\", line 106, in result\r\n    return self._coordinator.result()\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/futures.py\", line 265, in result\r\n    raise self._exception\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/tasks.py\", line 126, in __call__\r\n    return self._execute_main(kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/tasks.py\", line 150, in _execute_main\r\n    return_value = self._main(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/upload.py\", line 692, in _main\r\n    client.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key, Body=body, **extra_args)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/client.py\", line 272, in _api_call\r\n    return self._make_api_call(operation_name, kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/client.py\", line 576, in _make_api_call\r\n    raise error_class(parsed_response, operation_name)\r\nbotocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (IllegalLocationConstraintException) when calling the PutObject operation: The ap-east-1 location constraint is incompatible for the region specific endpoint this request was sent to.\r\n```\r\nI try setting AWS_DEFAULT_REGION in the Dockerfile and there is no more boto3 error.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nDockerfile\r\n```\r\nFROM nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:19.12-py3\r\n\r\nRUN pip install mlflow\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
