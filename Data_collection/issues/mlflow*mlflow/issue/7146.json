I have been trying the MlFlow Pipelines lately and am noticing that I don't know if it is working as intended. \r\nThe transform step should use user-defined transformation functions and then apply them to the train and validation dataset from the split step.\r\nHowever, when I use the transformation step to encode some of my features it only returns the features that are _transformed_.\r\nI followed [this example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlp-regression-example/blob/master/steps/transform.py) and I understand why the author is only getting the feature he needs for training, but what happens when you want both, the non-transformed and transformed features?\r\n\r\nThank you!
