The Dockerfile `ADD` command can take a file within its current folder or bellow OR it can download it from a URL. We have a local shared MLFlow server running and want to deploy by simply providing an experiment ID, which will be turned into a URL and the model artefacts. The docker image will be build and pushed to an image repo (with a version number) ready for deployment to an inference server.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the thoughts are on incorporating MLFlow into production environments, but this simple work flow would easily be supported with this simple feature.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n\r\nI guess adding something like this:\r\n```python\r\nimport tarfile\r\n\r\ndef make_tarfile(output_filename, source_dir):\r\n    with tarfile.open(output_filename, \"w:gz\") as tar:\r\n        tar.add(source_dir, arcname=os.path.basename(source_dir))\r\n```\r\nsomewhere and providing an additional URL that is predictable e.g.\r\n`http://192.168.1.25:5000/#/experiments/0/runs/3959cf318439410abfb90792029789d9/artefacts/subfolder` or something like that.\r\n\r\nI guess if you wanted to get tricky you could let then target specific sub directories?
