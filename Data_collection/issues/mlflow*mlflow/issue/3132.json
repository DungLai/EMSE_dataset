Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time. <-- but would be happy to provide guidance to someone interested in helping with this work - please comment if interested!\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAs per discussion in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3121, it'd save long-term maintenance cost if we can formalize and get community buy-in around a policy for which Python versions MLflow supports, and when we'll drop support for EOL'd Python versions.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [x] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nRelated: #2522, where we dropped Python 2 support in MLflow.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at formalizing our Python version policy, we should look at both what other ML libraries do (e.g. numpy/sklearn have a [well-specified versioning policy](https://scikit-hep.org/supported-python-versions)) and what other infrastructure tools do (e.g. Apache Airflow).\r\n\r\nThe difference is that in the infrastructure tool case, the common workflow may be to attempt to run e.g. airflow in a VM/docker container using the system Python, which is likely to be older. For example, Ubuntu 16.04 is actually still not EOL and ships with Python 2.x out of the box, while Ubuntu 18.04 ships with Python 3.5 and is only [EOL in 2028](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases). But it may be that the common practice is to encourage running airflow in a conda environment etc - the point is we should investigate it.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
