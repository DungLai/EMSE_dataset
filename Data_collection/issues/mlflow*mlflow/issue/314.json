We should consider deleting the quickstart dir or at least adding a README to explain why it exists and how it's different than the tutorials.\r\n\r\nIt would be much more instructive to new users if we organized the tutorials so that each is a separate MLflow project. Can have the structure be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexamples\r\n    |-  tutorial-1-sklearn-linear-regression\r\n    |-  tutorial-2-tensorflow-dnn\r\n    |-  tutorial-3-pytorch-dnn-tensorboard\r\n    |-  tutorial-4-sklearn-diabetes-jupyter\r\n    |-  tutorial-5-h20-random-forests\r\n    |-  tutorial-6-advanced-mlflow-api-usage\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn alternative is for us to officially make https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-apps the golden repository of all example \"apps\" and just point to that from a README inside of the `example` dir. Though, as a side note, that repo should probably be called mlflow-example-projects instead of mlflow-apps (since MLflow doesn't refer to them as apps, they are projects!).\r\n\r\nWhy should we have the mlflow-apps repository be separate from what's in the `example` dir? How should we decide what should go where between the two?","closed_by":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/314/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
