I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.28.0\n\n### System information\n\nDon't believe this is system specific\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nAutologged models for Tensorflow & Keras specify their default artifact paths as \"model\", as seen [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/6eccc69286b7d8b34ce6d34a20bf821e8c69feba/mlflow/keras.py#L734) and [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/6eccc69286b7d8b34ce6d34a20bf821e8c69feba/mlflow/tensorflow/__init__.py#L1038)\r\n\r\nThis results in the following directory structure:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1443174/190835782-86973e3c-bdec-4cbe-ba7d-d01516943199.png)\r\nWhen a user selects the top level `/model` directory, they are presented with the schema of the model and the MLflow model spark & pandas snippets. My understanding is that this information is pulled from the `/model/MLmodel` file.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when a user selects the nested `/model/data/model` directory in the UI, it appears mlflow attempts to do the same, and tries to load a `/model/data/model/MLmodel` file. As this file does not exist, it fails, and then the UI then displays: \"Couldn't load model information due to an error.\"\r\nA temporary pop up also appears describing the exact missing file error:\r\n```\r\nINTERNAL_ERROR: The following failures occurred while downloading one or more artifacts from <artifact_uri>: {'model/data/model/MLmodel': \"ResourceNotFoundError('The specified blob does not exist.<redacted>)\"}\r\n```\r\nNote I have redacted some specific request details/uris from the above.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour is that as `/model/data/model` is just a directory, the default \"select a file to preview\" UI should be shown.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1443174/190835919-a8fb6305-330a-4a3d-80a9-4cc9c25b713f.png)\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n`mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()` and any keras model & fit call within an mlflow run\n\n### Stack trace\n\nNA\n\n### Other info / logs\n\nI have manually copied the MLmodel file from `/model/MLmodel` to `/model/data/model/MLmodel` and the UI then shows the schema & code snippet UI when either the root `/model` directory or the `/model/data/model` directory is selected.\r\n\r\nI have also turned off auto model logging, and instead used `mlflow.keras.log_model` and specified an `artifact_path` other than \"model\", and that also seems to fix the issue. I have only called out keras/tensorflow as they are just the two I use, I suspect this may be an issue for all autologgers that have `artifact_path=\"model\"`.\r\n\r\nSo at this point I am not sure if it makes more sense to classify the bug as \"autologged models use an `artifact_path` that results in UI errors\", or \"UI makes incorrect assumptions about directory structure/names that results in UI errors\" \r\n\r\nAlso worth noting I am using a custom artifact_repository plugin, but at this point I believe the issue is within mlflow core.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
