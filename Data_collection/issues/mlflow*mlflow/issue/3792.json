Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows Server 2019 (or whichever distribution `windows-latest` gets you in Github Workflow)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/runs/1513241231?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nmlflow_cli is not working well on Windows -- Both issues below are the ones I have run into while attempting to enable GitHub CI workflow for MLflow R client on Windows in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/runs/1513241231?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nCurrently MLflow R client still depends on mlflow_cli for some of its functionalities, which is why Windows interop issues in mlflow_cli affects MLflow R client.\r\n\r\nThere are at least 2 problems:\r\n\r\n- Almost all calls to `os.path.join()` are not handling mixture of forward slashes and backward slashes well. Having both types of slashes in a file path will not work.\r\n-- Proposed solution: replace `os.path.join()` with `os.path.normpath(os.path.join())` (unless the resulting path is then passed to `os.path.abspath()` which internally calls `os.path.normpath()` already) so that the resulting path will only contain back slashes on Windows\r\n\r\n- \"ValueError: close_fds is not supported on Windows platforms if you redirect stdin/stdout/stderr\"\r\n-- Solution: TBD. I still need to look into what exactly causes this error on Windows.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nsee https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/runs/1513241231?check_suite_focus=true\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nsee https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/runs/1513241231?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
