Inspecting the code of this method, it seem that the only argument is `experiment_name`. \r\nI was able to change the `artifcat-root` default by creating an experiment using the command line `mlflow experiments create <experiment-name> --artifact-store <remote/artifact/store>` then using the  `mflow.create_experiment(<experiment-name>)`. \r\nMaybe it is possible to change the `artifcat-root` by using the `mlflow.set_tracking_uri`? If that is the case, then the method name is a little bit confusing (I though it was responsible for only changing where the metrics and logs are stored, i.e. the `file-store`). \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.
