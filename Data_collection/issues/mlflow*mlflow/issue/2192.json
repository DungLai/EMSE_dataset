Specifically I would like to use MLFlow as the tracking frontend for (Tune)[https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tune.html] as Tune runs on ray which has built in fault tolerance which is desirable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nChange the call signature of `AbstractStore.create_run` from `(self, experiment_id, user_id, start_time, tags)` to `(self, experiment_id, user_id, start_time, tags, run_uuid=None)`\r\n\r\nand then in the Store implementations add something like the following\r\n\r\n```\r\nif run_uuid is None:\r\n    run_uuid = uuid.uuid4().hex\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2192/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
