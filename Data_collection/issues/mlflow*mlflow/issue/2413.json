Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n## Guidelines\r\n\r\nFeature requests typically go through the following lifecycle:\r\n\r\n1. Submit feature request with high-level description on GitHub issues (this is what you're doing now)\r\n2. Discuss feature request with a committer, who may ask for a more detailed design\r\n3. After discussion & agreement on feature request, start implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe the proposal\r\nRight now, by default, when a model gets saved using `log_model()` the [`conda.yaml` environment always falls back to a pre-defined one](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.spark.html#mlflow.spark.log_model). However, for cases where there is already a local `conda.yaml` environment defined it could be good to use the existing one instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nLet's say we've got a MLflow project, with a `MLproject` and `conda.yaml` files defining the environment required for the model to run. Based on this, we can run `mlflow run ...` on the model folder and then save the trained model using `log_model()`. However, if we look into what MLflow generates in the `/mlruns/.../artifacts` folder, the `conda.yaml` environment will be just a default one instead of the existing `conda.yaml` file.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine that we've got the following `conda.yaml` environment already defined for our model:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: model-a\r\nchannels:\r\n  - defaults\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - python=3.6\r\n  - pyspark=2.4.0\r\n  - scikit-learn=0.22.1\r\n  - openjdk=8.0.152\r\n  - pip:\r\n      - mlflow==1.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, when we use `mlflow.spark.log_model()`, the generated `conda.yaml` will always have only `python`, `pyspark` and `mlflow` as listed dependencies:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nchannels:\r\n  - defaults\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - python=3.6.10\r\n  - pyspark=2.4.4\r\n  - pip:\r\n    - mlflow\r\nname: mlflow-env\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nChange the current behaviour of the `log_model()` method so that it checks first if there is an existing `conda.yaml` defined. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adriangonz","id":1577620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz","html_url":"https://github.com/adriangonz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adriangonz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
