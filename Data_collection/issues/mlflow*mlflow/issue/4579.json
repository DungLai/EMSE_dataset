Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nThe overall MLflow Projects page is confusing to some extent:\r\n- [ ]  Instead of using the sections titles \"Project Directories\" and \"MLproject File\" it would be easier to understand if they were called \"Without MLproject File\" and \"With MLproject File\" (only for example, maybe some other wording comes to mind).\r\n- [ ] The example MLproject file contains whitespaces in the project's name, this causes Docker to not accept the image URI. It is necessary to show at least a note that for Docker, the name must not contain any whitespaces.\r\n- [ ] There's no information that you need `-P` to provide parameters (except for one example run which runs a git repository and there's no real explanation accompanying it). It would be nice if that was explained where the parameters are introduced (https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#specifying-parameters).\r\n- [ ] There's no example command for a local run, only for the remote git repository. There's also no example how to specify different entrypoints instead of using `main` (for which you need the `-e` flag).\r\n- [ ] Although the documentation states that it creates a new Docker image, it doesn't mention that for both Conda and Docker, it uses the current commit hash appended to the name to create a new Conda environment and Docker image respectively.\r\n- [ ] Generally I feel like it would make sense to put the MLproject file in the center of attention of the documentation and provide an example config with some bold note underneath stating that you can also run projects without MLproject files. It might be that people use MLflow projects without an MLproject file but I suspect most people do and having an example file at the top makes everything pretty clear immediately and the project files are a central part. Having an example command how to run the project (remotely and locally) directly underneath would also be handy. After this short introduction, the more in-depth explanations could follow.\r\n\r\nI could contribute the smaller fixes, like adding missing information, and would like to collaborate for the larger restructurings (if any wanted at all).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
