Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\nPR: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3563/\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary (`pip install mlflow`)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow projects run ignores `docker_args` for docker container environments if `synchronous` is disabled.
