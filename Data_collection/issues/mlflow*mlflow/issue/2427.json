This Conda environment contains the current version of PySpark that is installed on the callerâ€™s system. dev versions of PySpark are replaced with stable versions in the resulting Conda environment (e.g., if you are running PySpark version 2.4.5.dev0, invoking this method produces a Conda environment with a dependency on PySpark version 2.4.5).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```Python\r\nimport mlflow.spark\r\nmlflow.spark.get_default_conda_env()\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput is \r\n\r\n```\r\n{'name': 'mlflow-env',\r\n 'channels': ['defaults'],\r\n 'dependencies': ['python=3.7.3', 'pyspark=2.4.5.dev0', {'pip': ['mlflow']}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the dependency on `pyspark=2.4.5.dev0`","closed_by":{"login":"djrscally","id":4592235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTIyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4592235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally","html_url":"https://github.com/djrscally","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrscally/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
