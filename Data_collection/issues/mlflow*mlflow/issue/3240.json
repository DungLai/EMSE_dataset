Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.9.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.10\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhile loading/fetching sparkml models/artifacts from GCS bucket, raises the below error because `client.list_artifacts(run_id, artifact_relative_path)` returns the **<FileInfo: file_size=0, is_dir=False, path=artifact_relative_path +'/'>** which(path) does not exist along with other FileInfos. Hence it sends 404 error for file not found.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce the issue\r\n`mlflow.spark.load_model(gcs_path_to_model)`\r\nor \r\n`client.download_artifacts(run_id, sparkml_model_relative_gcs_path)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nComplete error logs\r\n2020/07/07 13:49:25 INFO mlflow.spark: URI 'gs://gcs-datascience-adhoc-us/ashwar/ecf191ff5c864bc99b75e531b31c3e4a/artifacts/spark-model/sparkml' does not point to the current DFS.\r\n2020/07/07 13:49:25 INFO mlflow.spark: File 'gs://gcs-datascience-adhoc-us/ashwar/ecf191ff5c864bc99b75e531b31c3e4a/artifacts/spark-model/sparkml' not found on DFS.
