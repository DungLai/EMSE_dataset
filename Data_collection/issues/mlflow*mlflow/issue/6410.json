I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`run_id in a_list and tag.xx == yy`, the run_id / tag is a pre-defined object in python, and a_list is a python list object, and we can override eq / in / AND operator in python. \r\n\r\n\r\nPros: \r\n* We can directly use python object in the filter as the value to be compared, instead of concatenating the value into the filter string.\r\n* It can prevent user writing invalid filter, the python compiler can help check possible errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nAn improvement for MlflowClient search API with \"filter\" param.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
