Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes, slight modification of example.\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOs\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.11\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen loaded with pyfunc, the xgboost model [can't be printed](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/228e2cf65d2c09d0dc9dbfb9b082a542cd003f7e/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py#L436) because the attribute `run_id` is missing from the meta data. It seems as when [initiated](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/228e2cf65d2c09d0dc9dbfb9b082a542cd003f7e/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py#L407), `PyFuncModel` expects `run_id` to be in `model_meta` (but it does not look like it's asserted).\r\nWith `mlflow.xgboost.log_model()`, the `run_id` is correctly logged to `MLmodel`, but not with `mlflow.xgboost.save_model()`. \r\n\r\nHence, a quick fix would be to check if `run_id` is in `model_meta` before the existent check for `model_meta.run is None` in the pyfunc print method. Other way would be to write `run_id: None` when saving a model outside a run with `mlflow.xgboost.save_model()`. \r\nProbably we best aim for consistency with other flavours. I did not have time to check if they write `run_id: None` or simply don't write the key.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn import datasets\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport xgboost as xgb\r\niris = datasets.load_iris()\r\nX = iris.data\r\ny = iris.target\r\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\r\n\r\ndtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, label=y_train)\r\ndtest = xgb.DMatrix(X_test, label=y_test)\r\nparams = {\r\n            \"objective\": \"multi:softprob\",\r\n            \"num_class\": 3,\r\n            \"learning_rate\": 0.3,\r\n            \"eval_metric\": \"mlogloss\",\r\n            \"seed\": 42\r\n}\r\nmodel = xgb.train(params, dtrain, evals=[(dtrain, \"train\")])\r\n[0]     train-mlogloss:0.74723\r\n[1]     train-mlogloss:0.54060\r\n[2]     train-mlogloss:0.40276\r\n[3]     train-mlogloss:0.30789\r\n[4]     train-mlogloss:0.24052\r\n[5]     train-mlogloss:0.19087\r\n[6]     train-mlogloss:0.15471\r\n[7]     train-mlogloss:0.12807\r\n[8]     train-mlogloss:0.10722\r\n[9]     train-mlogloss:0.09053\r\n\r\nmlflow.xgboost.save_model(model, 'model')\r\nmodel2 = mlflow.xgboost.load_model('model')\r\nmodel2\r\n<xgboost.core.Booster object at 0x7f9e1798d0f0>\r\n\r\nmodel3 = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model('model')\r\nmodel3\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/lorenz/opt/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-1.11.0/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py\", line 437, in __repr__\r\n    if self._model_meta.run_id is not None:\r\nAttributeError: 'Model' object has no attribute 'run_id'\r\n```\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n@harupy probably a quick fix for you since you implemented most of the python xgboost features here.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
