System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Nope\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:  Binary using pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow 1.0.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.7\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow.log_metric(run_id, 'name', value)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen I log a metric value to MlFlow server then I go to the mlflow UI to the mteric view where it has the plot to view the metric value change over time, I find wrong time values for all metrics for all runs.  \r\n\r\nWhen I pick \"Time (Wall)\" to view absoulte time values, it displays times in \"Jan 19, 1970\" with 2 second intervals between each value change for the metric which is of course wrong.  \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nThat's how I run the server:  \r\n`mlflow server --backend-store-uri [mysql sqlalchemy connection] --host 0.0.0.0 --gunicorn-opts \"--access-logfile -\" --port 5150 --default-artifact-root [artifact location]`\r\n\r\nThen, I use \r\n`mlflow.log_metric(run_id, 'name', value)`\r\nto log values\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
