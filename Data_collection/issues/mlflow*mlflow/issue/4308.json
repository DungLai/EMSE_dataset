Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nMany organizations use existing JFrog Adrtifactory servers to govern artifacts produced by development pipelines. The same JFrog Artifactory server can certainly be used to govern models produced from machine learning training and development pipelines. JFrog has a multitude of connectors and for this particular case most of them can be used. For instance, it is possible to leverage the existing nuget connector for JFrog Artifactory\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- **What is the use case for this feature?** As the title says, support for more backend store integrations. One that's widely used.\r\n- **Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?** This will avoid scattered artifactory storage places.\r\n- **Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?** We already use JFrog. This will avoid using a different storage for ML artifacts\r\n- **Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?** MLFlow doesn't support this at all.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [X] `language/python`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThere's already an abstract class meant for the extension of supported stores, it's called ``ArtifactRepository``\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/artifact/artifact_repo.py\r\n\r\nWe can add support for nuget integration in MLFlow and that will indirectly enable integration to JFrog as well.\r\nHit two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\nHere are two links that are useful for this:\r\nhttps://jfrog.com/integration/nuget-repository/\r\nhttps://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Nuget+Repositories","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4308/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
