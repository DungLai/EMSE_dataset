I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nCurrently, when using the `mlflow run` command, parameters can be passed on to an entry point specified in `MLproject` using the option\r\n[`-P, --param-list <NAME=VALUE>`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#cmdoption-mlflow-run-P). This option does not support passing on flags.\r\n\r\nIt would be cool to support using flags to make it possible to use entry points that are already equipped with a CLI.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nIt would allow passing on flags from `mlflow run` to entry points specified in `MLprojects`.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nIn general, it would make it easier to integrate MLflow into an existing codebase where CLI entry points are already specified e.g. in a `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nIt would reduce the overhead of integrating MLflow into existing projects.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nCurrently, one would have to rewrite entry points using flags to work only with key-value parameters.\n\n### Details\n\nSupport for flags could be achieved by either allowing to specify parameters of the form `-P, --param-list <NAME>` which get passed on as `--<NAME>` to the entry point, or by creating an additional option like `-F, --flag-list <NAME>`.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [X] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"fabian-gringel","id":57798254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzk4MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57798254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel","html_url":"https://github.com/fabian-gringel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabian-gringel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6594/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
