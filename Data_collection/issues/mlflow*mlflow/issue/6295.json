I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nHi everyone; we are working on designing different options for users to define validation criteria (threshold for metric to satisfy) and pass it to MLflow.evaluate API for model validation; we are proposing following three options. We would love to hear from you which option is more user friendly to our data scientist/MLE users.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nAllow users to define metric thresholds that are required for adding model validation functionality to mlflow.evaluate API.\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nAllow users to perform validation check after developing and training a model; also can be used as a pre-deployment check if their ML Production Pipeline.\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nN/A\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Provide users with a class called MetricThreshold to define validation threshold for each metric. Users will call MLflow.evaluate by passing an array of MetricThreshold instances\r\n```\r\nclass MetricThreshold:\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n  :param name: Name of the metric\r\n  :param lower_bound: (Optional) Lower bound of the metric value\r\n  :param upper_bound: (Optional) Upper bound of the metric value\r\n  :param min_improvement: (Optional) minimum improvement threshold compared to baseline model\r\n  :param min_relative_improvement: (Optional) minimum relative improvement threshold compared to baseline model\r\n  :return: MetricThreshold\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n# Example Usage\r\nMLflow.evaluate(\r\n  ...,\r\n  validation_criteria = [\r\n    MetricThreshold(name=\"log_loss\", uppoer_bound=0.3, min_improvement=0.01,      min_relative_improvement=0.02),\r\n    MetricThreshold(name=\"f1_score\", lower_bound=0.8, min_improvement=0.01,      min_relative_improvement=0.05),\r\n]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n### Option 2: Let users define validation threshold in dictionary and pass an array of dictionary to MLflow.evaluate.\r\n```\r\n# Example\r\n\r\n{\r\n      \"metric_name\": \"log_loss\",\r\n      \"lower_bound\": 0.5,\r\n      \"upper_bound\": 0.9,\r\n      \"min_abs_change\": 0.05,\r\n      \"min_relative_change\": 0.1,\r\n}\r\n# Example Usage\r\nMLflow.evaluate(\r\n  ...,\r\n  validation_criteria = [\r\n    {\"metric_name\": \"log_loss\",\r\n      \"lower_bound\": 0.5,\r\n      \"upper_bound\": 0.9,\r\n      \"min_abs_change\": 0.05,\r\n      \"min_relative_change\": 0.1},\r\n    {\"metric_name\": \"f1_score\",\r\n      \"lower_bound\": 0.5,\r\n      \"upper_bound\": 0.9,\r\n      \"min_abs_change\": 0.05,\r\n      \"min_relative_change\": 0.1}\r\n  ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n### Option 3: Let users define thresholds as SQL expression strings.\r\n```\r\n# Example\r\nMLflow.evaluate(\r\n  ...,\r\n  validation_criteria = [\r\n    \"log_loss >= 0.7\",\r\n    \"log_loss <= baseline - 0.01\",\r\n    \"log_loss <= baseline * 0.98\"\r\n  ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\nWe want to know from user perspective, which option is more convenient; less learning, more intuitive.
