Plz suggest whether below things are possible or not - \r\n\r\n1.  Can I deploy `python_function` flavor of any model (SKLearn, torch, tensorflow etc) using `mlflow models serve` ( which gives a REST API ) with custom `handler` script ?\r\n2.  Is there any UI component available to see all the deployments and make a new deployment ?\r\n3.  Is there a generic UI screen available for each deployment which accepts standard data like `json`, `tensor` or `image` based on `signature` and calls deployed model and outputs data in that screen? This will be easier to quickly share deployments with clients so that they can quickly test. \r\n4.  As data preparation is an integral part of ML life cycle, Is there a way to keep track of all my versions of dataset (Data Versioning) ?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
