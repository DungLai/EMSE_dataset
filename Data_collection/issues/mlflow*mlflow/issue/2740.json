However, TensorFlow has a robust serving solution which more robust and performant. The proposal is to support serving Tensorflow models through the native TensorFlow based solution. \r\nMore info about TensorFlow Serving: https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe primary reason for supporting this is that models served in this way can be used for low-latency inference.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nIf the models is of TensorFlow flavor, `mlflow models build-docker` should build a serving image with using Tensorflow Serving.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2740/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
