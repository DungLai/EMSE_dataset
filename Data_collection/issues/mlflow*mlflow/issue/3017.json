Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nPagination of only 10 registered models is limiting, and the page you're on isn't stored in the URL so going back always takes you to the first page. I'd prefer all models be on a single page with a scrollbar, but could the number per page be configurable?\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Navigation back to page that you were on, seeing all models on a single page, user missed the models on the second page.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Who likes 10 per page by default?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Easier to navigate and see the state of all models (which are production, etc) if they're on a single page.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? This is a minor issue and there is no unachievable use case\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
