REST API -- the fundamental, JSON-y truth.\r\n2. CLI -- a subset of the API (e.g., `mlflow experiments list`, as well as some more powerful integrated workflows like `mlflow run`\r\n3. Python SDK -- currently, a subset of the REST API, focused on components needed for tracking a single experiment.\r\n\r\nThere is work in progress for adding R and Java/Scala SDK support as well.\r\n\r\nWe should complete the Python SDK. In particular, there is mixed support for experiment CRUD, runs CRUD, and metrics/artifact CRUD.","closed_by":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
