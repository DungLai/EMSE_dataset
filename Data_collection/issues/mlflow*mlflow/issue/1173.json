It becomes very slow once there are thousands of runs in an experiment and someone invokes the `list_all_run_infos` method of the tracking client. This method parses then reads into the memory an entire suite of runs for no obvious reason. The root cause is the `os.listdir` function which I suggest should be replaced with `os.scandir`, if it's not creating breaks in other functionalities.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nThe original code is here\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cb6d657bc7cb4e2ec07719e6a1d46c1d84928fd7/mlflow/utils/file_utils.py#L45-L46\r\n\r\nHere is my suggestion.\r\n```python\r\ncreate_full_path = lambda x: os.path.join(root, x)    \r\npath_filter_func = lambda x: filter_func(create_full_path(x))\r\n\r\nmatches = filter(path_filter_func, os.scandir(root))\r\nif full_path:\r\n    return map(create_full_path, matches)\r\nelse:\r\n    return matches\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
