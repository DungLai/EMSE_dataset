Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in MLflow or a feature request.\r\n\r\nRecently, \r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/file_store.py#L195-L196 was changed. This change causes artifact locations like `file:./mlruns/3`, even when `--default-artifact-url` is set. This has two problems:\r\n1. I was depending on `--default-artifact-uri`, which is still available to this function as `self.artifact_root_uri`\r\n2. the `file:` prefix is invalid, causing `mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Could not find a registered artifact repository for: file:./mlruns/2/25b088aa1ead480696244d46cbf1b461/artifacts.
