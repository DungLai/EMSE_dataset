Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [✔] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n add a feature that would get the entire data once the signature is diaplayed\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nthis would let all the people working on the mlflow to access the data once the model is published\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nfor a naïve user can get the data in the entire work flow\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nthis would reduce the bulk data transvers and the data can be simply accessed at a time\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\ninput_example only gives the first row of the data set and has no other attributes \r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [✔ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [✔ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ✔] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here.
