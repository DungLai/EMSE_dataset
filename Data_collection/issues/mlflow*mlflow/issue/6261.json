I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nAdd step argument to mlflow.log_figure()\r\n\r\nAdd slider in ui to navigate over time/steps.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nIt is currently impossible to analyze the dynamic of metrics visualized via figures (histograms, confusion matrices, roc curves, model outputs, etc.)\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nA substantial part of model design uses instrumentation beyond simple scalar values over time.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nI monitor the dynamics of confusion matrices during training.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nThe current workaround is to save plots as separate files which is inconvenient in terms of navigation. One cannot compare multiple figures from a run or across runs simultaneously.\n\n### Details\n\nHere is the ui for figures in tensorboard for example:\r\n\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2022-07-13 13-35-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3764009/178724799-122a81b2-f6a9-47e6-9db0-50de7262e963.png)\r\n\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6261/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
