Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.12\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: not applicable\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow run . -b databricks --backend-config cluster-config.json`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen running mlflow projects using the Databricks projects backend two distinct run_id's seem to be created. The first run id is created by the client submitting the shell command job to databricks. This creates a run on the tracking server and connects the job status to that run. The MLFlow library then creates a bash command job as a databricks job by running the following command on the databricks job\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow run PATH_ON_DATABRICKS --entry-point MY_ENTRY_POINT\r\n -c '{\"_mlflow_local_backend_run_id\": \"THE RUN ID OF THE RUN CREATED BY THE CLIENT\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when this command is executed in the databricks job the config for the local backend passed by `_mlflow_local_backend_run_id` seems to be ignored. This results in a new run being created on the tracking server. This is the run where the databricks job will log all its parameters to.\r\n\r\nIt seems easy to fix this issue by, instead of passing the client run id to the databricks job via that (seemingly private) `_mlflow_local_backend_run_id` parameter as the backend config, using the `--run-id` cli option. I've created a small MR to show how this could be resolved (#3788 ).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nI am not able to reproduce this issue locally, it seems only in the databricks job the local backend config `_mlflow_local_backend_run_id` is ignored.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, create any simple mlflow project and try to run that with the databricks backend.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n[This](https://ibb.co/9w2Fjny) is a picture of how runs show up in the UI. The bottom run is created by the client running `mlflow run . -b databricks` the top run is the run created by the bash job executed on databricks that actually performs the work. The bottom run will always have state UNFINISHED since it is never completed by any running job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"FlorisHoogenboom","id":14967659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTY3NjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14967659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorisHoogenboom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
