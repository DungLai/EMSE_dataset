This allows a non-existent model to be registered, and the error is only caught when you try to fetch the model from the registry.\r\n\r\nHowever, when calling create_model_version() against the Databricks MLflow tracking server an error is reported. See error below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"/Users/andre/venvs/mlflow-export-import-env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_model_registry/client.py\", line 221, in create_model_version\r\n    mv.name, mv.version, mv.status, mv.status_message\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Model version creation failed for model name: CDE_banner1000 version: 1 with status: FAILED_REGISTRATION                     and message: Failed registration.
