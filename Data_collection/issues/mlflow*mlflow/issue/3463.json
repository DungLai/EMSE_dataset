Till now, I have able to achieve following things:\r\n 1) Setting up mlflow server on a remote machine and running the python script from another client machine\r\n 2) Able to successfully store the params and metrics on the remote server, but `log_artifacts()` is not saving the artifacts remotely, in fact it stores locally in ./mlrun folder. \r\n\r\nNow, I just want to figure out a way to log artifacts remotely, which I have been struggling with since a day. On reading github issues, it seems that using NFS, SFTP and HDFS could help. However, I couldn't find a proper documentation for using NFS server with mlflow, and hence request anyone who has used NFS or other method to successfully store the artifacts.\r\n\r\n I look forward to a solution at the earliest. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNakul \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
