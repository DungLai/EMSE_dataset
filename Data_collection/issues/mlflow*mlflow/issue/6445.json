Instead it is \"tombstoned\" and marked as \"deleted\" in the \"lifecycle_stage\" column in the underlying database. The error message is:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Cannot set a deleted experiment 'sklearn_iris' as the active experiment. You can restore the experiment, or permanently delete the experiment to create a new one.\r\n```\r\nThere is no API method to \"permanently delete\" the experiment per error message.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: Document MLflow experiment delete semantics](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6444#top)\r\n\r\nNote that this is for OSS MLflow and not Databricks MLflow. The latter does allow you to recreate a deleted experiment.\r\n\r\nThe semantics for deleting an experiment should be consistent with those of deleting a registered model where there is no tombstone semantics.\r\n\r\nDatabase tombstone example:\r\n```\r\nselect * from experiments;\r\n+---------------+--------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+\r\n| experiment_id | name         | artifact_locatio                  | lifecycle_stage |\r\n+---------------+--------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+\r\n|             0 | Default      | file://opt/mlflow_server/mlruns/0 | active          |\r\n|             1 | sklearn_iris | file://opt/mlflow_server/mlruns/1 | deleted         |\r\n+---------------+--------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nAdd an option to `Mlflow.delete_experiments()` to permanently delete the experiment. Since there is no \"ON DELETE CASCADE\" clause on the `experiments` table,  you would need to do the following in the underlying database:\r\n```\r\ndelete from latest_metrics where run_uuid = 'e30e657d4fa14807a8c1dae9ef66f2d6' ;\r\ndelete from metrics where run_uuid = 'e30e657d4fa14807a8c1dae9ef66f2d6' ;\r\ndelete from params where run_uuid = 'e30e657d4fa14807a8c1dae9ef66f2d6' ;\r\ndelete from tags where run_uuid = 'e30e657d4fa14807a8c1dae9ef66f2d6' ;\r\ndelete from runs where run_uuid = 'e30e657d4fa14807a8c1dae9ef66f2d6' ;\r\n\r\ndelete from experiments where name = 'my_experiment' ;\r\n```\n\n### Tracking information\n\nclient.delete_experiment(experiment_id)\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(experiment_name)\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nclient.delete_experiment(experiment_id)\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(experiment_name)\n\n### Stack trace\n\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Cannot set a deleted experiment 'sklearn_iris' as the active experiment.
