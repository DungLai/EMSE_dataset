I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: custom code\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen two mlflow models have the same name for the code packaged with them, for example: a preprocessing code name `prep_features` was packaged with two different mlflow models. If the first mlflow model is loaded, then the second one is also loaded, python will only load the `prep_features` module once. This leads to problems if `prep_features` for the second model is different from the first model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nprep_features. py change 1 to 2 when creating custom_model2 with the 2m1cn.py script\r\n```python\r\ndef preprocess_features():\r\n    return 1 # 2 for custom_model2\r\n```\r\n2m1cn.py use this file to create custom_model1 and custom_model2 \r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow.pyfunc\r\n\r\nclass CM(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        pass\r\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\r\n        from prep_features import preprocess_features\r\n        return preprocess_features()\r\n\r\n# Construct and save the model\r\nmodel_path = \"custom_model1\" # \"custom_model2\"\r\ncode_path = [\"prep_features.py\"]\r\ncustom_model = CM()\r\nmlflow.pyfunc.save_model(path=model_path, python_model=custom_model, code_path=code_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\ntest.py now use this file to test your created models\r\n```python\r\n# Evaluate the models\r\nimport mlflow.pyfunc\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nmodel_input = pd.DataFrame([range(10)])\r\nloaded_model1 = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\"custom_model1\")\r\nprint(f\"Model1: {loaded_model1.predict(model_input)}\")\r\nloaded_model2 = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\"custom_model2\")\r\nprint(f\"Model2: {loaded_model2.predict(model_input)}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output should be 1 for custom_model1 and 2 for custom_model 2. But because of the bug the output is 1 for both.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
