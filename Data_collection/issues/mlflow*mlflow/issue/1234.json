Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in MLflow or a feature request.\r\n\r\nMLFlow UX Issue:\r\n\r\nWhen running hyperparameter tuning with MLflow, an error was produced when my training loss was NaN. Specifically, the follow exception was risen:\r\n\r\n`RestException: INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE: Metric 'Epoch Training Loss' cannot have value NaN`\r\n\r\nThis seems like errant behavior, since I'd ideally like to hyperparm tune over many combinations of params, and thus not have my tuning cut off from an accidental NaN. It seems like NaNs may occur in this process, and the user should not be responsible for checking for them. \r\n\r\nIdeally, this would just warn the user, instead of halting their tuning.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\nTry to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
