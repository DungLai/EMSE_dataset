Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: \r\n\r\n‚ùØ lsb_release -a\r\nNo LSB modules are available.\r\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\r\nDescription:    Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS\r\nRelease:        20.04\r\nCodename:       focal\r\n\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.9 (tested in 3.6 and 3.8 and had same issue)\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: The issue is only prevalent when using a corporate proxy with resigned TLS certs. Created a simple docker-compose deployment of MLFlow that reproduces the issue by using a self signed cert for Minio (representing S3): https://github.com/PeterSulcs/mlflow-issue \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow 1.11.0+ does not respect the setting of `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` or `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` when an S3 artifact repo is used with a self signed cert.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/PeterSulcs/mlflow-issue.git\r\ncd mlflow-issue\r\ndocker-compose up\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, locally, with a Python 3.7.9 environment:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install mlflow==1.13.1 boto3 scikit-learn\r\nsource .env\r\npython mlflow_test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n```\r\npython train.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File
