Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: no\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: try both 0.9.0 and 1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow ui`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI work with my regular ML pipeline, which log the results using `mlflow`, previously on `0.9.0`. I update recently to `1.11.0`, do several changes in code accordingly (replace run_uuid with run_id in mlflow.start_run and so far this is all), but now I fail to open the table with results. I try with both `0.9.0` and `1.11.0` without success and even without a clue what is going on. For `0.9.0` there is an additional info in console, that *WARNING:root:Experiment ID mismatch for exp 0. ID recorded as '0' in meta data. Experiment will be ignored. NoneType: None*, but I assume that is because of changes still 0.9 release. There is no additional info about error or warning in console for `1.11.0`.\r\n\r\nI will attach my `mlruns` directory and screenshot of Chrome Dev Console below. Thanks\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n`mlflow ui` in dir with given mlruns\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n[mlruns.zip](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/files/5317488/mlruns.zip)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-10-02 13-49-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1048312/94916980-57e43800-04b8-11eb-988c-f16f214d1f7a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3487/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
