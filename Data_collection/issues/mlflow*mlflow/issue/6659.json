I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.27.0\n\n### System information\n\nI'm using mlflow-cli\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nI would like to permanently delete some deleted runs in my mlflow server but the command `mlflow gc` seems to do nothing, so I tried to gc a particular run with the command `mlflow gc run-ids <run_id>` but I got the error `mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Run '<run_id>' not found`.\r\n\r\nHowever, using `mlflow runs describe --run-id <run_id>` I could get the following result so the run exists and its lifecycle_stage is deleted (sensitive information masked).\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"info\": {\r\n        \"artifact_uri\": \"gs://path/to/gcs/bucket\",\r\n

forwarding)\r\n- Artifact URI: gs://path/to/gcs/bucket\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nmlflow gc --run-ids <run_id>  \n\n### Stack trace\n\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File
