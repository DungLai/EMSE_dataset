This results in the Run comparison page looking like this:\r\n![mlflow_comparison_nested_configs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7363758/82066536-db4ee980-96cf-11ea-8f66-8de7663efa41.png)\r\n\r\nAs shown, the parameters that are themselves dictionaries are displayed in a single row of the table. I'm guessing this is because they are retrieved as plain strings when the page is loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visualization would be much more useful if each level of a nested configuration was displayed indented and in a new row, much like in a .yaml file. Maybe this can be done with a (recurrent) check if a param can be read as dictionary.\r\n\r\nIn case of deep nesting, there could be a fixed upper limit (e.g. 3) supported by mlflow.\r\nIdeally there would be a button in the UI, so the user can control the depth of nested params they want to see by expanding/contracting these params.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since nested are not read as dictionaries, they are not searchable in order to filter runs.  \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2838/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2838/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
