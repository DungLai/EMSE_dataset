Here is what I'm doing:\r\n\r\nStep 1: Run all data prep steps in my Jupyter notebook\r\nStep 2: start an Anaconda command prompt and go the same directory of the notebook\r\nStep 3: start mlflow as follows:\r\n\r\n`mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./artifacts`\r\n\r\nStep 4: set tracking uri in the notebook as follows:\r\n\r\n`mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://localhost:5000')`\r\n\r\nStep 5: run experiments in the notebook\r\nStep 6: register the best experiment as production (in the notebook)\r\nStep 7: start another command prompt and go the same directory of the notebook\r\nStep 8: serve the registered model as follows:\r\n\r\n`mlflow models serve --model-uri models:/random-forest/Production -p 1234 --no-conda`\r\nAt this stage I get the following error:\r\n\r\n> Model Registry features are not supported by the store with URI: 'file:///C:/localpath/mlruns'. Stores with the following URI schemes are supported: ['databricks', 'http', 'https', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite', 'mssql'].\r\n\r\nThough, I'm using a sqlite database (as seen in step 3). MLFlow is using it - because I can see the sqlite file size increase when I run experiments. Everything (including the UI) is working fine except serving the model. When I run the `mlflow models serve...` command, it automatically creates the \"mlruns\" folder in the same directory and bypasses the sqlite database and the artifacts folder.","closed_by":{"login":"vvvkkk123","id":42914663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTE0NjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42914663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123","html_url":"https://github.com/vvvkkk123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvvkkk123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
