I have configured the artifact root to log to Azure blob storage. \r\nIf I run my program the logs show up in the UI and if I save the model I see the model appearing on blob storage.\r\n\r\nHowever, the logs that were generated during the application run are only stored inside the docker and not remote. Is there a way to store the logs remote from the configuration or would I need to devise a system to store the logs as well on a remote system ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your insights\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nThere aren't really logs / issues.
