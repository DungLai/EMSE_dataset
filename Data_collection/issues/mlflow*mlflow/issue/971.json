File URIs have the following structure, as interpreted by `urllib.parse.urlparse`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfile://<netloc>/<path>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, MLflow's [_get_file_store()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7195f298814e9580311311d715a09425269d6b43/mlflow/tracking/utils.py#L145) method only parses the `path` component of the URI, ignoring the `netloc` entirely. This results in an incorrect output location for *relative* URIs (absolute URIs seem to work because the `netloc` is interpreted to be empty)\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nReproduce by running the following code from the MLflow repository root:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nexport MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=\"file://tmp/mydir\"\r\nmlflow run examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.7\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the `tmp` prefix is ignored from the output directory. The `FileStore` instead attempts to refer to `/mydir`.","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
