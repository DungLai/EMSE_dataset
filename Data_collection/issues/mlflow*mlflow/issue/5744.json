Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nCustomize defaults for `http_request`.\r\n \r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Allow users to customize timeout\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Currently the default timeout is 2 minutes with 5 retries and a backoff of 2x which goes over an hour before it fails. \r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) There is no way to customize the timeout using the Pytho nAPI\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py#L94\r\n```python\r\ndef http_request(\r\n    host_creds,\r\n    endpoint,\r\n    method,\r\n    max_retries=5,\r\n    backoff_factor=2,\r\n    retry_codes=_TRANSIENT_FAILURE_RESPONSE_CODES,\r\n    timeout=120,\r\n    **kwargs,\r\n):\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould change to \r\n```python\r\n\r\n_MAX_RETRIES=5\r\n_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=120\r\n_BACKOFF_FACTOR=2\r\ndef http_request(\r\n    host_creds,\r\n    endpoint,\r\n    method,\r\n    max_retries=_MAX_RETRIES,\r\n    backoff_factor=_BACKOFF_FACTOR,\r\n    retry_codes=_TRANSIENT_FAILURE_RESPONSE_CODES,\r\n    timeout=_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,\r\n    **kwargs,\r\n):\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
