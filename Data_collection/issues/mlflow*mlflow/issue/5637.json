This was with the expectation that a custom request header provider would be invoked on every request. However when I install the plugin, using pip install, the code in custom plugin is not executed.\r\n\r\nPlease help me with the following:\r\n\r\n1. What could be the reason for the same? \r\n2. If I need to use google authentication, is there any documentation for such an implementation?\r\n3.
