Artifacts are stored in local mlruns folder. Lets call this user as user A. Then I run another mlflow server from another Linux user and call this user as user B. I wanted to migrate older experiments and their artifacts that resides in mlruns directory of user A to mlflow that run in user B. I simply moved mlruns directory of user A to the home directory of user B and run mlflow from there again. When I accessed to mlflow UI by browser I saw that artifact location is configured correctly to mlruns folder of user B, but I couldn't see the experiments that moved from user A's mlruns directory. Is there any capability for uploading experiments and artifacts to another MLFlow server? How can I accomplish it?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4643/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
