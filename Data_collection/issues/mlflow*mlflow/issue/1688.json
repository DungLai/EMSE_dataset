The **summary** key is a very long string while the database column is only VARCHAR(250).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Setup a tracking server using MySQL backend with the following script:\r\n> mlflow server --backend-store-uri mysql+pymysql://user:pass@localhost/db_name --default-artifact-root s3://bucket_name_here --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n2. Then used the keras training script here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/keras.py\r\n\r\n3. Added the tracking server uri to the top of the script:\r\n\r\n> mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://mywebsite.com')\r\n\r\n4. Ran the training script and received an error on the server.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nI attempted PostgreSQL instead of MySQL just to attempt and it had the same issue.\r\n\r\nFull traceback here: [traceback.txt](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/files/3458279/traceback.txt) or [traceback as a gist](https://gist.github.com/fdabek1/1f3a0d82e090f064926e8fe5a0f21aac)","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1688/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
