Readonly tags are useful for specifying run specific information that should never be edited such as type, source and version information.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution: Add a Readonly flag to RunTag\r\nThe RunTag message has string Key and string Value. The proposal is to add bool Readonly to the RunTag message. By default, Readonly will be false.\r\n\r\n### Pros:\r\n1. Addition of the Readonly flag with default value false makes forward/back compatibility simple.\r\n1. Reading and querying the Value of a Tag does not change.\r\n1. Easy to enforce mutability of the Tag.\r\n### Cons:\r\n1. Stores must handle the Readonly flag for consistent behavior on the existing run tags.\r\n\r\n## Alternative Solution 1: Separate list for read only tags.\r\nIntroduce a separate list of tags on the RunData i.e. ReadonlyTags, that is write once like Params.\r\n\r\n### Pros:\r\n1. Stores can choose when to support the read only tags on a run without affecting the behavior of the existing tags.\r\n### Cons:\r\n1. Reading and querying for a tag requires querying two lists.\r\n1. Need to maintain single namespace across two lists, e.g. handle key conflicts across the run tags and read only tags.\r\n\r\n## Alternative Solution 2: Prefix Key with 'readonly.'\r\nNaming the key with the 'readonly.' prefix would mark it as a readonly tag.\r\n\r\n### Pros:\r\n1. No modification of contracts.\r\n### Cons:\r\n1. Stores need to manage key conflicts. E.g. \"key_name\" and \"readonly.key_name\" are the same key.\r\n1. Stores must parse keys to enforce the mutability of a tag.","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
