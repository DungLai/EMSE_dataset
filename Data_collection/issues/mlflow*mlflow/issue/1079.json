However, I can only view the metrics for a particular run for a certain day, which means I can only see one value of that metric for that day. \r\n![Screenshot from 2019-04-01 16-27-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4297204/55365869-0c079b80-549b-11e9-9fff-d42d3b9f2ef2.png)\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there is a way to visualize the metrics over time, for example, AUC over days?
