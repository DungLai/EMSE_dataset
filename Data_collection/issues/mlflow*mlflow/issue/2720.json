Submit feature request with high-level description on GitHub issues (this is what you're doing now)\r\n2. Discuss feature request with a committer, who may ask for a more detailed design\r\n3. After discussion & agreement on feature request, start implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe the proposal\r\n#2620 made improvements to the line smoothness functionality in the metrics plot view; we now display the smoothed value and the original value at each point on a given metrics plot curve. Unfortunately, we do not provide any visual reference for the original value; this makes it somewhat difficult to reason about the original value.\r\n\r\nTo provide visual guidance for the original value figure displayed in a smoothed metrics plot, I propose displaying a faded \"shadow\" curve with the original values in addition to the smoothed curve in the metrics plot view.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nAs discussed above, the lack of any visual reference for the original metric value displayed at a point along a given smoothed metric curve makes it difficult to reason about how this value changes as a function of `x`.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nWe propose to introduce a UI-only change that adds a shadow curve to the metrics plot view as follows:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n![79368483-5459f600-7f04-11ea-8054-cf0e49d2136b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39497902/79497725-05cc5a80-7fdd-11ea-83e1-c01247678e1f.png)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"774\" alt=\"79389927-acecbb80-7f23-11ea-988e-32409df246dc\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39497902/79497749-11b81c80-7fdd-11ea-930f-62b208e4661d.png\">","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
