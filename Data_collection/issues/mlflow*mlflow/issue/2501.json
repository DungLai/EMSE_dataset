System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/docker\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip install mlflow\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.6\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe example MLflow project (and my own aswell) using a docker_env and run with above command throws a docker error.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: Python file is executed and tracked and run is added in mlruns.\r\n\r\nActual behavior: \r\ndocker throws an error\r\n> docker: Error response from daemon: invalid mode: \\git_repos\\mlflow_example\\mlruns\\0\\e6763b1645214c54bb5d606e3be72170\\artifacts.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that mlflow tries passes a -v flag to docker to map a host directory to itself:\r\n_docker run --rm -v D:\\git_repos\\mlflow_example\\mlruns:/mlflow/tmp/mlruns **-v
