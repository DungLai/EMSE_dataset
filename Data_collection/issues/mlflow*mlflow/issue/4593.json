For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.14.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n`delete_model_version()` deletes a registered model from model registry, however, newly added models skip deleted version numbers. E.g, if I delete `version 2` of a model, next logged model with the same name takes `version 3`. I would expect it to take `version 2`, since `version 2` doesn't exists anymore.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4593/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4593/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
