Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10 Pro\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.7.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.5\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCan't start run Mlflow once the default experiment 0 has been deleted. I will expect it to either use the next available ID or overwrite experiment 0 and bring it back to active.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Initialize mlflow in a folder by \r\n```mlflow experiments list```,\r\n which create default experiment 0\r\n2. Delete the experiment 0 by\r\n```mlflow experiments delete -x 0```\r\n3. Create a jupyter notebook in the same folder and run\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    pass\r\n``` \r\nIt will throw the error:\r\n```\r\nMlflowException: Could not create run under non-active experiment with ID 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMlflowException                           Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-3-d6a861b94e0d> in <module>\r\n      1 import mlflow\r\n----> 2 with mlflow.start_run():\r\n      3     pass\r\n\r\nc:\\users\\louis\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python37\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\tracking\\fluent.py in start_run(run_id, experiment_id, run_name, nested)\r\n    151         active_run_obj = MlflowClient().create_run(\r\n    152             experiment_id=exp_id_for_run,\r\n--> 153             tags=tags\r\n    154         )\r\n    155 \r\n\r\nc:\\users\\louis\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python37\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\tracking\\client.py in create_run(self, experiment_id, start_time, tags)\r\n    121         :return: :py:class:`mlflow.entities.Run` that was created.\r\n    122         \"\"\"\r\n--> 123         return self._tracking_client.create_run(experiment_id, start_time, tags)\r\n    124 \r\n    125     def list_run_infos(self, experiment_id, run_view_type=ViewType.ACTIVE_ONLY):\r\n\r\nc:\\users\\louis\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python37\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\tracking\\_tracking_service\\client.py in create_run(self, experiment_id, start_time, tags)\r\n     86             user_id=user_id,\r\n     87             start_time=start_time or int(time.time() * 1000),\r\n---> 88             tags=[RunTag(key, value) for (key, value) in iteritems(tags)]\r\n     89         )\r\n     90 \r\n\r\nc:\\users\\louis\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python37\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\store\\tracking\\file_store.py in create_run(self, experiment_id, user_id, start_time, tags)\r\n    392                 \"Could not create run under non-active experiment with ID \"\r\n    393                 \"%s.\" % experiment_id,\r\n--> 394                 databricks_pb2.INVALID_STATE)\r\n    395         run_uuid = uuid.uuid4().hex\r\n    396         artifact_uri = self._get_artifact_dir(experiment_id, run_uuid)\r\n\r\nMlflowException: Could not create run under non-active experiment with ID 0.\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2690/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
