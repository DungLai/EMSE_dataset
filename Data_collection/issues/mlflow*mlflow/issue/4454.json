Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\nLinux\r\nMy image is based on python:3.6-stretch\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\nbinary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n1.17.0\r\n- **Python version**:\r\nPython 3.6.13\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n- mlflow server \\\r\n  --backend-store-uri postgresql://mlflow_data:mlflow_data@$MLFLOW_DB_URI/ \\\r\n  --default-artifact-root artifacts \\\r\n  --workers 16 \\\r\n  --host 0.0.0.0 \\\r\n  --port 8888 \\\r\n  --gunicorn-opts \"--timeout 180 --log-level=DEBUG\"\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow server in AWS ECS on c5.xlarge instance works but it is *very* slow.\r\nAccess using API and command line works fine but some requests hang for ~30 seconds before completition\r\nMLFlow UI is extremely slow even though I have only 1 experiment and 1 run and use an external Postgres\r\n\r\nrunning the same container locally (on my laptop with SSD) works fast\r\n\r\nOur current hypothesis is that EBS disks make it very slow. We tried using an instance with SSD and it works fine but for technical reasons we can't use a different (from c5.xlarge) instance type.\r\n\r\nSo out current hypothesis is that slow IO leads to gunicorn workers to timeout all the time\r\nWe do see\r\n> [33] [CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:206)\r\nconstantly\r\n\r\nrunning MLFlow under strace reveals that to server the front page mlflow reads a lot of static files and may also create a folder for artifacts\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n- mlflow server \\\r\n  --backend-store-uri postgresql://mlflow_data:mlflow_data@$MLFLOW_DB_URI/ \\\r\n  --default-artifact-root artifacts \\\r\n  --workers 16 \\\r\n  --host 0.0.0.0 \\\r\n  --port 8888 \\\r\n  --gunicorn-opts \"--timeout 180 --log-level=DEBUG\"\r\n\r\non AWS c5.xlarge instance\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
