(I did \"pip3 install mlflow\")\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``python -c \"from mlflow import version; print(version.VERSION)\"``)**:  0.2.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.\r\n- **npm version (if running the dev UI):  5.3.0\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n\"mlflow ui\"\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in MLflow or a feature request.\r\n\r\nHere is the terminal console logs:\r\n\r\n$ mlflow ui\r\n[2018-07-01 23:35:56 -0700] [3302] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.8.1\r\n[2018-07-01 23:35:56 -0700] [3302] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (3302)\r\n[2018-07-01 23:35:56 -0700] [3302] [INFO] Using worker: sync\r\n[2018-07-01 23:35:56 -0700] [3305] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 3305\r\n[2018-07-01 23:46:16 -0700] [3302] [CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:3305)\r\n[2018-07-01 23:46:16 -0700] [3305] [INFO] Worker exiting (pid: 3305)\r\n[2018-07-01 23:46:16 -0700] [3402] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 3402\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I opened a browser and tried reaching to \"http://127.0.0.1:5000/\".  I dont see the dashboard of all my runs.  I only see \"The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.\"\r\n\r\nIt took some time to see the [CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT error in the logs.  My hunch is, the npm module, which serves the http://127.0.0.1:5000 request timeout as it is not up.  Hence the error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\nTry to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
