The call to`mlflow.keras.autolog()` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow.keras\r\nmlflow.keras.autolog()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThe the `autolog()` function  in `mlflow.keras` module tries to import keras directly from the global namespace, however in TF 2.0 keras is a submodule of TensorFlow. In fact if I change the line 427 in keras.py from `import keras` to `from tensorflow import keras` the autologging works as expected.\r\n\r\nTracelog of the exception:\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-9-8539acb3e9a3> in <module>\r\n----> 1 mlflow.keras.autolog()\r\n      2 \r\n      3 with mlflow.start_run():\r\n      4 \r\n      5     y = y_ctr\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/keras.py in autolog()\r\n    425     excluding ``mode`` and ``verbose``.\r\n    426     \"\"\"\r\n--> 427     import keras\r\n    428 \r\n    429     class __MLflowKerasCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):\r\n\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
