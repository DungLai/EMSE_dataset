Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a link to the documentation entry in question.\r\n\r\n### Description of the proposal (what needs changing):\r\nDevelopers using MLflow APIs expect good descriptions of the API interface as well as code snippets that show how\r\nto use a method. Adding code snippets to all Python MLflow APIs will be an ongoing effort—to improve developer experience—but let's start with the `mlflow` module first.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
