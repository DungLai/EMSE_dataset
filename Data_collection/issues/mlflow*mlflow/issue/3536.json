Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.11\r\n- **Python version**: 2.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nRunning the mlflow project with float parameter value in exponential format throws the INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE exception - \"Changing param value is not allowed\":\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nUsing the provided docker example in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/docker, running it with \r\n`mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5 -P alpha=0.00001`\r\n`mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5 -P alpha=1e-1`\r\nthrows an INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE exception. However the same with parameter in decimal format works until 4 decimal places, e.g:\r\n`mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5 -P alpha=0.01`\r\n\r\nThe bug seems to be related to how floating parameter values are stored either in exponential format or decimal format. \r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 65, in <module>\r\n    mlflow.log_param(\"alpha\", alpha)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\", line 214, in log_param\r\n    MlflowClient().log_param(run_id, key, value)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 205, in log_param\r\n    self._tracking_client.log_param(run_id, key, value)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 179, in log_param\r\n    self.store.log_param(run_id, param)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/rest_store.py\", line 143, in log_param\r\n    self._call_endpoint(LogParam, req_body)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/rest_store.py\", line 32, in _call_endpoint\r\n    return call_endpoint(self.get_host_creds(), endpoint, method, json_body, response_proto)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py\", line 137, in call_endpoint\r\n    response = verify_rest_response(response, endpoint)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py\", line 103, in verify_rest_response\r\n    raise RestException(json.loads(response.text))\r\nmlflow.exceptions.RestException: INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE: Changing param values is not allowed.
