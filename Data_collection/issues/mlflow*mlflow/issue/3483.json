However Azure Blob storage has the ability to use Azure Activate Directory for giving access. This would mean that you wouldn't have to distribute the key to the users (which also give them access to the whole storage account and not only the blob container.) and a system admin would just give the user access. To do this one can use the [azure-identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity) package. \r\n\r\nThis would also have the benefit when deploying MLflow in AKS can use the service principal of your pod.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is that you can have some users only have read access to the store.\r\n\r\nThis cloud easily be done by extending the  `AzureBlobArtifactRepository` class without any breaking changes (as far as I can see).\r\n https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/4f700b56cf0e389b31b67388947725da99221ef6/mlflow/store/artifact/azure_blob_artifact_repo.py#L12\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3483/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
