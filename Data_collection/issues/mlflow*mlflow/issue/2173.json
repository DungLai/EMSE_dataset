Also we would like to know if any incremental changes in the source code is being tracked by the mlflow. Also does mlflow has any mechanism which saves/logs the prediction metrics/result as part of model serving?\r\n\r\nProposed Changes\r\n\r\nWe are having below queries so wanted to know if these features are being incorporated or is in progress\r\n\r\n1.Does mlflow support data lifecycle management as well, which means if the training data is refined and model is built on this changing data, then is there any mechanism how mlflow tracks which data version was used for training the model at that particular instant.\r\n\r\n2.Does mlflow allows/tracks the incremental changes in the source code, which means if there is any additional piece of code/logic written for the same application, then is there any mechanism if mlflow saves this incremental source code changes.\r\n\r\n3 When we serve the model using mlflow and pass the validation/real data for predictions,is there any mechanism if mlflow saves/logs this prediction metrics as part of model serving?\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
