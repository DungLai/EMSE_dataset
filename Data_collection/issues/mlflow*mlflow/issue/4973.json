Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 (Ootpa)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary (I think? ðŸ™‚ Installed through `pip` via `poetry`)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.21.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: See code for reproducing\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is for `client.get_metric_history` to return an empty list when the given metric has not been logged before. Actual behavior is a raised exception with the message:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Metric 'accuracy' not found under run '4e18eced00654b2db9165ceda272c592'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `get_metric_history` for a `MlflowClient` raises an exception when the given metric has not been logged before. In the documentation it says that the return value is: \"A list of :py:class:`mlflow.entities.Metric` entities if logged, else empty list\".\r\n\r\nEither the documentation is incorrect or the code (atleast for file store) is. See `mlflow.store.tracking.file_store.FileStore::_get_metric_history` for root cause of exception.\r\n\r\nI have only tested this using the file store.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n    run_id = run.info.run_id\r\n\r\n    # Call client.get_metric_history\r\n    client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()\r\n    metric_history = client.get_metric_history(run_id, \"accuracy\")\r\n\r\n    # Should be an empty list, as per the documentation\r\n    # Instead it raises an `mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException`\r\n    assert metric_history == []\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"~/contrib/mlflow/getmetrichistory.py\", line 9, in <module>\r\n    metric_history = client.get_metric_history(active_run_id, \"accuracy\")\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 217, in get_metric_history\r\n    return self._tracking_client.get_metric_history(run_id, key)\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 76, in get_metric_history\r\n    return self.store.get_metric_history(run_id=run_id, metric_key=key)\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/file_store.py\", line 644, in get_metric_history\r\n    return self._get_metric_history(run_info, metric_key)\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/file_store.py\", line 650, in _get_metric_history\r\n    raise MlflowException(\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Metric 'accuracy' not found under run '4e18eced00654b2db9165ceda272c592'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
