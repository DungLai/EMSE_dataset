Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nWhen running a project (with `mlflow run` the API) using a Docker container environment, MLflow has an option to automatically build (or re-build) the Docker image based on a Dockerfile specified in the MLproject file.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nUsers that make frequent changes in their Docker image and do not want to re-build it themselves.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nMakes working with Docker container environments much easier.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nIt would simplify the adoption of MLflow in my team. Relying on conda environments is not an option we are considering.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nI could not see a way to implement this as a plugin and ended up creating a really simple wrapper, but I feel this feature is interesting enough to be part of MLflow.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [x] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI created a very simple wrapper for MLflow to do this feature and a few others (not the subject of this FR):\r\nhttps://github.com/saulvargas/mlflux/blob/master/mlflux/cli/run.py#L70-L106 (it does a few other things that are irrelevant to this FR).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
