Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\n1) Show only columns which have values at least for one of the currently displayed (selected/filtered) runs\r\n2) Show only columns with more than one unique value for the currently displayed runs\r\n3) Remember user's selection of columns and don't show all the columns again as soon as another run starts or the user leaves the page to open one of the runs or compares them etc.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nOver time, lots of parameters and metrics are collected within an experiment, some of them become irrelevant, others are still important but you want to see the essential in the list\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nCurrently, even after you've tediously selected the columns, whenever a new run starts or you leave the page and then come back, all 100 columns are displayed again. This is the biggest drawback of mlflow, which is otherwise great!\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
