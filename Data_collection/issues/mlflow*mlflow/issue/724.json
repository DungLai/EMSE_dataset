When accessing the UI, they pass the 'namespace' as a parameter and then the UI only show their own experiments. \r\n\r\nUsers can share their experiment result with a URL with have their namespace in it. Proper access control can be added later.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/724/reactions","total_count":81,"+1":81,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
