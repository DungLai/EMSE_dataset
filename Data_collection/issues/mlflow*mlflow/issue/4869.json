Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAllow setting the location of the source directory in the `MLproject` file when executing in a Docker environment.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe `mlflow run` command uses the directory of the `MLproject` as the source directory. When using Docker, it copies its contents as a new layer to the Docker image. A typical (at least in my case) setup for a project is the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot project dir\r\n├── MLproject\r\n├── data\r\n└── src\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow all the data will be copied to the new layer which takes forever (depending on the size of the data in folder `data`). Putting the project file into the `src` directory works but now code that is implemented to be executed from the root directory doesn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to allow setting the source directory in the `MLproject` file and enhance flexibility.","closed_by":{"login":"florianblume","id":2170192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzAxOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2170192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume","html_url":"https://github.com/florianblume","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4869/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
