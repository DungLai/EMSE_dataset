Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nLet the contour color in the comparison graph more accessible to color blindness\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn my case, I could not clearly distinguish green from orange. These two color appears in the graph when there are more than two contour. I always need other's help to read the graph. I think this FR could benefit someone likes me. Indeed, their are about 12% mean and 0.5% women in the world have various degrees of color blindness.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nIt seems(?) not difficult if I just want to change the color map. I found the code in [`mlflow/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/CompareRunContour.js`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/8e74cdd108ff324175e38d621b12d9b2aced05bd/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/CompareRunContour.js#L98)\r\n```javascript\r\n    const colorscale = [\r\n      [0, 'rgb(5,10,172)'],\r\n      [0.35, 'rgb(40,60,190)'],\r\n      [0.5, 'rgb(70,100,245)'],\r\n      [0.6, 'rgb(90,120,245)'],\r\n      [0.7, 'rgb(106,137,247)'],\r\n      [1, 'rgb(220,220,220)'],\r\n    ];\r\n```\r\nHowever, that would be better to adding a new toggle (just below the Points toggle) to switch this feature on/off. Another issue is to find the best color map for the color blindness. It might takes some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
