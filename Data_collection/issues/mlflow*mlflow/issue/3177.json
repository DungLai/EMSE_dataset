However, my company is restricting the internet connection such that the required files cannot be downloaded to build up the conda environment.\r\nIn the docu I read:\r\n\"Alternatively, you can set MLFLOW_PYTHON_BIN and MLFLOW_BIN environment variables\r\ninstead. MLFLOW_PYTHON_BIN should point to python executable and MLFLOW_BIN to\r\nmlflow cli executable.\"\r\nI don't see how to set these parameters to make use of an existing environment that - to my understanding - should in general be available on Databricks 7.x and what the correct paths (e.g. /dbfs/databricks/...) are.\r\nAny clarification on that would be muchappreciated, thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n-\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"n8shadow","id":54710007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzEwMDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54710007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow","html_url":"https://github.com/n8shadow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8shadow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
