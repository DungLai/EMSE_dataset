I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nCurrently, In MLFow, the sequential execution for different components is missing. Even though there are multiple entry-points possible, but case of multiple components to be executed sequentially with single entry-point hasn't been observed here (in my personal knowledge of MLFlow till now, but i could be wrong though)\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nFor use-case/s, where ML pipeline for any general ML application will get better support from inclusion of this feature.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nIt will give users better control over the pipeline, where the single MLproject can contain whole pipeline covering all the components, irrespective if it is for production or for just dev environment.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nOur organisation is currently looking for open-source alternatives for ML experiment tracking and monitoring, and found that although MLFlow can serve some of the purpose, yet the current form might not be helpful entirely for our use-case. So me as representative from my organisation, is ready to commit time to make this resource more robust and adaptable for our use-case.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nThere are tools present in current MLOps environment which are either too use-specific or complex to use or are proprietary. We as startup although are looking to have more robust and future proof MLOps infrastructure, so that we don't need to focus ourself again and again on migration. Hence looking for some tools to incorporate in our MLOps ecosystem which are easy to adapt for our different use cases (our's is using different speech and text models for our product).\n\n### Details\n\nSo, the whole idea of this proposal is to make MLproject file for MLflow sufficient enough to include whole ML-pipeline for different use-cases i.e. each component mentioned in MLproject file to be part of whole pipeline which are contributing to pipeline independently and yet executing sequence-wise. Adding this feature while help in controlling the flow over the whole MLproject as it will give user the power of early-stopping of the pipeline if certain criteria doesn't get fulfilled by working components while sequential execution.\r\n\r\nI initially started exploring the MLflow with above motive, yet was not able to configure current tool to serve above mentioned case. So I am filing this proposal, just incase if this feature is really isn't part of current MLFlow.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [X] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [X] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [X] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [X] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [X] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
