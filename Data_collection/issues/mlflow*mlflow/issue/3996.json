Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Using a custom pyfunc based model.\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: conda\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.12.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow model serve ...`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe schema validation of the model serving seems not to work well with boolean columns. Strings and null values are accepted and converted to something.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nInput schema with `ColSpec(\"boolean\", \"boolColumn\")` and pass a string (i.e. \"NotABoolean\") to the API after serving the model.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
