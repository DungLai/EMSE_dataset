This is where it's interesting, especially to compare with other runs. Sometimes it's very important to verify that a certain run is converting towards 0.09 versus another one that is 0.11. Hence, zooming is the only way to verify the amount with those tiny deltas.\r\nThe initial uninteresting large amounts are skewing the zooming to a uselessly large view.\r\n\r\nI understand that the ui is using plotly. Maybe it's just matter of setting a parameter and then zoom is activated without much effort?","closed_by":{"login":"stablum","id":2955615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU2MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2955615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum","html_url":"https://github.com/stablum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stablum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
