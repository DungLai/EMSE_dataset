Why is it valuable to support, and why is it currently difficult or impossible to achieve? Could the desired functionality alternatively be implemented as a third-party package using MLflow public APIs?*\r\n\r\nWe often need to deploy our models (e.g. for image classification) at a certain operating point on a precision/recall curve. For example: we want to only make predictions for a class if the probability for it is above a certain threshold, where we determine the threshold based on a trade-off between precision and recall (that one can glean from a precision recall curve).\r\nWe want to do this programmatically (automatically determine the right threshold given a requirement about the precion and/or recall), instead of a human manually looking at some image to determine the right threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n*For user-facing changes, what APIs are you proposing to add or modify? For internal changes, what code paths will need to be modified?*\r\n\r\nFor this to work we would like to log the (precision, recall, threshold) scores to MLFlow and make them queryable. As a bonus one could visualize the Precision/Recall curve (or any other curve of that sort) natively in MLFlow.\r\nCurrently one can only log metrics that are single \"key: value\" pairs, which doesn't seem to work for our use-case.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1810/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
