I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nAs a user, I would like to be able to accept or reject transition requests using the Python API for MLflow. This capability is, of course, already available with the REST API.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nTo automate the process of deciding whether to accept or reject transition requests using the Python API.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nI believe that many users of MLflow would want to automate the transition of their models once requests are made. I believe that the majority of them will also be interested in performing certain operations, such as checks or other validations before deciding to accept or reject a transition.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nBefore accepting transition requests, my organization is interested in putting models through a series of checks. If the models passes these checks, the transition will be allowed and rejected otherwise. We would like to be able to achieve this using Python.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nAs of now, we are required to do this by sending a request to the REST API endpoint using Python, which is somewhat cumbersome.\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
