The use case is several developers are checking projects into the same repo but on their own branches before merge. `branch` option will be more convenient compared to `version` option in such case.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adrian555","id":10642337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQyMzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10642337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian555","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian555/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/426/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
