Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.0 documentation explicitly says the default model serialization format should be [SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)  format (not HDF5). HDF5 was the default for older TensorFlow Keras 1.\r\n## Motivation\r\n- MLflow TensorFlow 2.0 functionality should be  compatible with TensorFlow 2.0 standards.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n\r\n\r\n##  Related Issues\r\n- https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3224 - [BUG] Cannot save Keras/TF_2.x model as SavedModel format using mlflow.keras.log_model with kwargs { \"save_format\": \"tf\" }\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
