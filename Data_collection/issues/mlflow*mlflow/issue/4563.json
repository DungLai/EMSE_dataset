Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time (sadly lacking the competence for front-end development).\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nRun information can be nested to arbitrary levels and that seems to get correctly stored in the data, however, the information is not shown properly nested in the GUI and everything below the top level run is shown at the same level. \r\nIt would be extremely useful to visualize nested information properly. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAlmost all proper ML experiments are nested more deeply than one level: an experiment consists maybe of several runs with different hyperparameter values, where each nested run is e.g. a cross validation estimation step, which consists of k training/test evaluation steps. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4563/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
