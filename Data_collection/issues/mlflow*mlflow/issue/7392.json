I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nI want to use mlflow by parallel runs. But, mlflow is not thread-safe. when using `mlflow.start_run()` code, run id  becomes a global variable. So, every parallel runs become crashed.\r\n\r\nI found a method of `log_artifact()` in `mlflow.client()`. This method is not log model and meta info of model to mlflow tracking server, but only save to registry server.\r\n\r\nI want to method for `mlflow.client` like `mlflow.skelarn.log_model()` that is save model to registry and log to mlflow tracking server. \r\n\r\nIs it possible? \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nWhen using `mlflow.client`, There is no way to log model to mlflow tracking server. `log_artifact()` method in `mlflow.client` is only save to registry not log.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThis feature is necessary to users who want to use mlflow in parallel.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nNow I',m using `mlflow.onnx.log_model()`. So parallel runs become crashed. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
