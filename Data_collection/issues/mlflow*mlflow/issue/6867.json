Search for a single run by ID: `attributes.run_id = 'ab204ab19ef64d2eb2af6138c16584d0'`.\r\n\r\n2. Search for multiple runs by ID: `attributes.run_id IN ('ab204ab19ef64d2eb2af6138c16584d0', '301d0343282a4df882fb56019ac12c2e', ...)`.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nUsers often want to retrieve a specific run or group of runs. Right now, they have to use the GetRun API to do this, which doesn't support batching.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nThere aren't any batch APIs for fetching runs\n\n### Details\n\n1. We can implement single-run search by adding the `@searchable_attribute` decorator to `RunInfo.run_id` here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/fa96efefc6f415d39038ce489aaf55217c6018af/mlflow/entities/run_info.py#L95, and we can add tests here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/tests/utils/test_search_utils.py.\r\n\r\n2. We can implement multi-run search by adapting the support offered by model version search (see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/fa96efefc6f415d39038ce489aaf55217c6018af/mlflow/utils/search_utils.py#L51 / https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/fa96efefc6f415d39038ce489aaf55217c6018af/mlflow/utils/search_utils.py#L891-L903) to MLflow Runs search. We can add tests here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/tests/utils/test_search_utils.py.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
