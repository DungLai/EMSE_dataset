Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary (pip)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.12.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.log_artifact(\"/path/to/file\", artifact_path=\"<<Azure Blob Storage URI>>\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nSimilar to issue  #3478 (except this is referring to the Python version), the Azure Blob Storage Python SDK causes a timeout if the upload takes too long. This can be solved by setting the `timeout` keyword when uploading a file, but MLFlow does not provide a way to set this value. I have implemented [solution](https://github.com/ismailuddin/mlflow/commit/e0e9148ea8a7e19ecb060de750bd3c5e02d71b34) in a fork of my own, which uses an environment value that can be set. If this approach is suitable, I can make a PR for it.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.log_artifact(\"/path/to/file\", artifact_path=\"<<Azure Blob Storage URI>>\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
