Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nMLflow currently auto infers schema information. This functionality is introduced within mlflow.models, which is also exposed in TrackingClient classes through imports, even within the FileStore. Thus lazy loading of numpy and pandas is finnicky. The feature set is also hard to easily degrade since the base types are not currently supported in the type system used for Schema, Signature, and Inputs/Outputs.\r\n\r\nA vendored approach to the dtypes section and a subset of pd.DataFrame would cover most of the functionality used for this feature set in MLflow. The vendored code can be used as\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n   import pandas as pd\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n   from mlflow.vendor.pandas import pd  # where pd has a subset of the functionality\r\n                                                                  # testing for skinny client should catch breaks in usage of the vendored pd/np\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nmlfow.models introduces a strong numpy and pandas dependency. Using vendoring for a smoother experience without numpy or pd can help improve the skinny client while not requiring a rewrite of many mlflow components around Model\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nSame skinny client motivation from other issues around improved usability in new environments\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nModel Schema features are a strong value add of mlflow, turning the features completely off may detract adoption of the skinny client\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nCurrently the model signature heavily uses numpy and pd and is also imported at the mlflow.model level, which causes early ImportErrors if the packages are not installed.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
