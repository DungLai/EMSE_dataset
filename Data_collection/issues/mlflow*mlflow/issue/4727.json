Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: no\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: `pip install`\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.19.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.0\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: -\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe runs preview is not being loaded properly for a specific use case.\r\n\r\nSupposing we have two experiments as follows:\r\n- `experiment1`: has 150 runs.\r\n- `experiment2`: has 5 runs.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing the Mlflow server (UI) and clicking on the `experiment1` option, the first 100 runs are shown, then if we click on the `experiment2` option no runs are shown.\r\n\r\nBy inspecting the page (Network tab) we can see that the second request (`experiment2`) to the `/ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/runs/search` endpoint is not returning any value.\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the `experiment1` option, it is performing a POST request to the endpoint with the following payload:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"experiment_ids\":[\"1\"],\r\n    \"filter\":\"\",\r\n    \"run_view_type\":\"ACTIVE_ONLY\",\r\n    \"max_results\":100,\r\n    \"order_by\":[],\r\n    \"page_token\":null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen if we click on the `experiment2`, it is performing a POST request with the following payload:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"experiment_ids\":[\"2\"],\r\n    \"filter\":\"\",\r\n    \"run_view_type\":\"ACTIVE_ONLY\",\r\n    \"max_results\":100,\r\n    \"order_by\":[],\r\n    \"page_token\":\"eyJvZmZzZXQiOiAxMDB9\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen decoding the `page_token` (`echo eyJvZmZzZXQiOiAxMDB9 | base64 --decode`) we can see it represents `{\"offset\": 100}` which is probably used for pagination purposes.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the `page_token` generated by `experiment1` pagination is being used for the `experiment2` request and it is returning an empty response since we just have 5 runs for `experiment2`.\r\n\r\n**Note that when refreshing the `experiment2` page, the `page_token` is set to `null` and the runs are loaded properly.**\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n- Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8.\r\n- Install Mlflow: `pip install mlflow==1.19.0`\r\n- Run the `mlflow server` locally.\r\n- Create the experiments and runs using the following script:\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_experiment('experiment1')\r\nfor i in range(150):\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.log_param('x', i)\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_experiment('experiment2')\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.log_param('y', i)\r\n```\r\n- Open the Mlflow server in a web browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`\r\n- Click the `experiment1`: the first 100 runs should be loaded.\r\n- Click the `experiment2`: no runs should be loaded:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1009397/130500375-81146364-5324-434a-ba08-5bd59b79f8ae.png)\r\n- Refresh the page (F5), the runs now appears:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1009397/130500458-038c7448-68af-432d-8d91-f2ff31209f85.png)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
