I don't know why the data for this API request is so long. I litteraly use the following line to log the pytorch model, where fit.model is a pytorch `nn.Module`. \r\n\r\n```\r\n        mlflow.pytorch.log_model(fit.model, self.model_dir)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect our training code does somethign to the pytorch net which makes the log really long and therefore it can't be stored in a tag, which is what mlflow is using to store their model information. \r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n-\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pietermarsman","id":3833456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzM0NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3833456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman","html_url":"https://github.com/pietermarsman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietermarsman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4702/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
