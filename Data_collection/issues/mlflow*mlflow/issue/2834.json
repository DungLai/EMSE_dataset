Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes.

I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\nSomewhere in [Tracking UI](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-ui)\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nIt is far from being clear that, if you want to set up a remote MLFlow tracking server:\r\n- the artifact store needs to be accessible from both the client and the server\r\n- the client is the one actually pushing the artifacts to the artifact store, not the server\r\n- actual credentials for the artifact store are left for the installer to figure out. And in some cases are stored in plain text in the python code, which is not really best practice, especially if you version your code e.g. with GIT\r\n\r\nHere is a drawing of my understanding, I hope I understood things correctly\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2760084/82057370-86a57180-96c3-11ea-980c-11c4f351cfdc.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2834/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2834/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
