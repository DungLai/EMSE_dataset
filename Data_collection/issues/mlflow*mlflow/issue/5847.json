Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\n\n### System information\n\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Mac Big Sur\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.25.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nWhen I mistakenly use experiment_name rather than experiment_id in the create_run method, the server throws a 500 error (uncaught error) rather than a RestException:\r\n```\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient\r\nclient = MlflowClient()\r\nclient.create_run(\"example experiment name\")\r\n```\r\nWe would like that input validation caught and returned as a RestException to the client rather than a 500 error on the server, because many users accidentally set their experiment name as the parameter rather than experiment_id.\n\n### Tracking information\n\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: http://localhost:5000\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient\r\nclient = MlflowClient()\r\nclient.create_run(\"example experiment name\")\r\n```\n\n### Other info / logs\n\nError (on client side):\r\n```\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5000):
