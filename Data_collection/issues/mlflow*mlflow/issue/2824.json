Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.7.2\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.7.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: python -c \"from mlflow import projects;projects.run('C:\\asd')\"\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nGit uri regex matches absolute Windows path starting with drive (e.g. C:\\..). As a result running projects.run('C:\\...') results in the error:\r\n```\r\ngit.exc.GitCommandError: Cmd('git') failed due to: exit code(128)\r\n  cmdline: git fetch -v origin\r\n  stderr: 'fatal: 'C:/asd' does not appear to be a git repository\r\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\r\nand the repository exists.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe git uri regex seemse to be too broad, matching any path containing `:`\r\n```\r\n_GIT_URI_REGEX = re.compile(r\"^[^/]*:\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom mlflow import projects\r\nprojects.run('C:\\\\asd')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from mlflow import projects\r\n>>> projects.run('C:\\\\asd')\r\n2020/05/14 09:45:26 INFO mlflow.projects: === Fetching project from C:\\asd into C:\\Users\\USER_NAME\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpciv1cczr ===\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"D:\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\projects\\__init__.py\", line 288, in run\r\n    use_conda=use_conda, storage_dir=storage_dir, synchronous=synchronous, run_id=run_id)\r\n  File \"D:\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\projects\\__init__.py\", line 104, in _run\r\n    work_dir = _fetch_project(uri=uri, force_tempdir=False, version=version)\r\n  File \"D:\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\projects\\__init__.py\", line 342, in _fetch_project\r\n    _fetch_git_repo(parsed_uri, version, dst_dir)\r\n  File \"D:\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\projects\\__init__.py\", line 382, in _fetch_git_repo\r\n    origin.fetch()\r\n  File \"D:\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\git\\remote.py\", line 790, in fetch\r\n    res = self._get_fetch_info_from_stderr(proc, progress)\r\n  File \"D:\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\git\\remote.py\", line 674, in _get_fetch_info_from_stderr\r\n    proc.wait(stderr=stderr_text)\r\n  File \"D:\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\git\\cmd.py\", line 412, in wait\r\n    raise GitCommandError(self.args, status, errstr)\r\ngit.exc.GitCommandError: Cmd('git') failed due to: exit code(128)\r\n  cmdline: git fetch -v origin\r\n  stderr: 'fatal: 'C:/asd' does not appear to be a git repository\r\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\r\nand the repository exists.'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
