Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.18.0\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI trained an R model on RStudio Cloud. I use the mlflow 1.18.0 package to log it to Azure Databricks. This works fine. I use the Azure Databricks user interface to register the model and transition it to 'staging'. This also works fine. When I try to serve the MLflow model following [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/applications/mlflow/model-serving), I get warnings and an error:\r\n```\r\nSat Jul  3 05:23:16 UTC 2021\r\n/databricks/chauffeur/model-runner/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py:1020: InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host 'eastus2-c2.azuredatabricks.net'.
