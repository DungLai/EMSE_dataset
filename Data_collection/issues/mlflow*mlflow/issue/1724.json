For this I suggest an addition to the fluent API that allows to just log all local variables with various parameters (e.g., only logging parameters of the current function, only logging local variables, etc.). This is currently only proposed for the Python API.\r\n\r\nThis functionality could be provided by an MLflow wrapper as exemplified here: [mlflowhelper](https://github.com/mgbckr/mlflowhelper)\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\ndef main(param1, param2, param3=\"defaultvalue\", verbose=0, *args, **kwargs):\r\n    some_variable = \"x\"\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.log_vars(exclude=[\"verbose\"]) # logs local variables as parameters\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    main(\"a\", \"b\", something_else=6)\r\n```\r\nThis will log:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"param1\": \"a\",\r\n  \"param2\": \"b\",\r\n  \"param3\": \"defaultvalue\",\r\n  \"something_else\": 6\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more complete version of the function can be found here: https://github.com/mgbckr/mlflowhelper/blob/master/src/mlflowhelper/tracking/fluent.py","closed_by":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
