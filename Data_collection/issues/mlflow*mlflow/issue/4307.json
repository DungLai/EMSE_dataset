Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nAdding a functionality in both the UI and API to move a tracking run to a different experiment.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nOften it's nice to be able to reorganize experiments. For example scope may change mid experiment, or by mistake a run is logged to the wrong place.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nCurrently there is no functionality to organize experiment. It's only create, log and delete.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nWe currently move run folders manually, this is quite hacky and mistakes can happen, an formal solution.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nThere is currently no clean move functionality within MLflow (UI or API)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n- Adding move button and API calls in UI\r\n- Adding move endpoint in REST API\r\n- Adding move functionality for local tracking and DB (python and java?)","closed_by":{"login":"jinzhang21","id":78067366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDY3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78067366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21","html_url":"https://github.com/jinzhang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
