Motivation\r\nDocker Image produced by MLFlow for predicting the models is supposed to be the most portable format but unfortunately, the docker image produced by MLFlow is of huge size. We tried with a simple model file with 1kb size (a simple regression model) but the resultant docker image is 3.3 GB.  We are trying to deploy these docker images (about 60) in Kubernetes but since K8s nodes will have limited resources, docker images of this size make mlflow a non-viable option. \r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nPlease let us know how the docker image size for predicting the model can be reduced. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2426/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
