For instance, it's impossible to serialize scikit-learn pipelines if they contain TensorFlow or some other external librairies in the steps of the pipeline. \r\n\r\nSee our full list of problems of [using scikit-learn for deep learning and AutoML](https://www.neuraxio.com/en/blog/scikit-learn/2020/01/03/what-is-wrong-with-scikit-learn.html). \r\n\r\nHere are our [solutions to doing deep learning with scikit-learn-like-pipelines using Neuraxle](https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/scikit-learn_problems_solutions.html#). \r\n\r\nHere is an [example Neuraxle deep learning pipeline using TensorFlow](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle#deep-learning-pipeline-definition). The ability to serialize tensorflow steps inside scikit-learn pipelines is a pain reliever as explained in the solution link above. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n\r\nI explained this already in the title `Describe the proposal` above. \r\n\r\nFiles to get inspiration from: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/sklearn.py\r\n- https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/tensorflow.py\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that we don't save exactly 1 file like a pickle, but rather, many files with subfolders. May zip and unzip the whole thing if needed. \r\n\r\nSee also: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#module-mlflow.sklearn\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
