I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.27.1.dev0\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Mac OS Monterey 12.4\r\n- **Python version**: v3.7.13.

However, when I trained a model and the loaded it via Spark UDF (see reproduce code below), I got the following error which I don't know how to solve. This is not an issue when run in Databricks.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn error occurred while calling o90.collectToPython.\r\n: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0) (10.0.0.30 executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkException: Python worker exited unexpectedly (crashed)\r\n```\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import struct\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"demo\")\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n    X, y = load_diabetes(as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)\r\n    model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)\r\n    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, artifact_path=\"train/model\")\r\n\r\nmodel_uri = \"runs:/{run_id}/train/model\".format(run_id=run.info.run_id)\r\nX, _ = load_diabetes(as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)\r\n\r\nspark = (\r\n    SparkSession.builder.master(\"local[*]\")\r\n    .config(\"spark.jars.packages\", \"io.delta:delta-core_2.12:1.2.1\")\r\n    .config(\"spark.sql.extensions\", \"io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension\")\r\n    .config(\r\n        \"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog\", \"org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog\"\r\n    )\r\n    .getOrCreate()\r\n)\r\n\r\ninput_sdf = spark.createDataFrame(X)\r\npredict = mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf(spark, model_uri, env_manager=\"conda\")\r\nscored_sdf = input_sdf.withColumn(\"prediction\", predict(struct(*input_sdf.columns)))\r\nscored_sdf.head(1)\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [X] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
