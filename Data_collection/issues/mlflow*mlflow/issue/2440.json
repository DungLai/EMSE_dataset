Giving users and organizations control over the way they (post-process and) visualize their configurations, metrics and artifacts could speedup experimentation, analysis, and reporting dramatically.\r\n\r\nSome use cases:\r\n- hierarchical configuration\r\n  Experiments with many components usually need a nested configuration structure (dictionary). \r\n\r\n- multi-dimensional metrics\r\n  Some metrics might not be scalars, but 2d (e.g. histograms) or 3d. \r\n\r\n- model comparison\r\n  One might want to visualize and compare model architectures.\r\n\r\nAn API for creating UI plugins that customize the experiment, run and run comparison views could be the solution.\r\n\r\nIn a [slack discussion](https://mlflow-users.slack.com/messages/CFYUVSHEZ/), @jhadjar suggested that, this can be implemented using  Flask's Blueprint. The core (mlflow ui) application can discover plugins using `find_packages` from `setuptools`, register them and display them _if the plugins want to be displayed_.\r\n\r\nI think this would be useful for 3 reasons:\r\n1) let UI engineers / developers focus on the framework, instead of every detail a user could want.\r\n2) give control to the users to do exactly what they want.\r\n3) as a consequence of 2, ease users' life and speed up experimentation by 30000% (:P)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2440/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
