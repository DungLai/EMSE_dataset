Unbiased presentation of challenger models: AML can quickly present a plethora of challenger models using the same training set as your incumbent model. This can aid the data scientist in choosing the best model family.\r\n>\r\n> 2. **Diagnostics And Exploration**. Detecting Target Leakage: because AML builds candidate models extremely fast in an automated way, we can detect data leakage earlier in the modeling lifecycle. Canonical diagnostics can be automatically generated such as learning curves, partial dependence plots, feature importances, etc.\r\n>\r\n> 3. **Automation**. Tasks like exploratory data analysis, pre-processing of data, hyper-parameter tuning, model selection and putting models into production can be automated to some some extent with an Automated Machine Learning framework.\r\n\r\n### DataRobot\r\n\r\n[DataRobot uses AutoML](https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/automated-machine-learning/) in their machine learning process.\r\n\r\n![screen-shot-2018-03-21-at-10 50 46-am-e1521807708174-1024x544](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6625584/42399187-aa646c70-8121-11e8-94f3-4b7e65fe5344.png)\r\n\r\n> When developing a model with the traditional process, as you can see from Figure (above), the only automatic task is model training. Automated machine learning software automatically executes all the steps outlined in red â€“ manual, tedious modeling tasks that used to require skilled data scientists. The traditional process often takes weeks or months, but with automated machine learning, it takes days at most for business professionals and data scientists to develop and compare dozens of models, find insights and predictions, and solve more business problems much faster.\r\n\r\nFor additional inspiration, check out the following three Github topics: [automated-machine-learning](https://github.com/topics/automated-machine-learning), [auto-ml](https://github.com/topics/auto-ml), [automl](https://github.com/topics/automl)","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/628/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
