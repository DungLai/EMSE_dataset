Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow.tensorflow.autolog() with early stopping callback to model.fit(); and set \"restore_best_weights\" = True\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen using an early stopping callback with `restore_best_weights=True`, autolog() erroneously assumes early stopping has happened even if training proceeds till last epoch. It computes `restored_epoch = stopped_epoch - max(1, patience)` which produces incorrect epoch number if there was no early stopping. There should be an additional check to see if `stopped_epoch != n_epochs`, to ensure early stopping has happened. \r\nThis has the side effect of flipping metric plot in mlflow UI, putting an older metric value at a higher step value, giving the impression of increasing loss or decreasing accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nAny tf.keras.Model code(v2.1 or higher), with this callback added to `model.fit()` \r\n```\r\ntf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss',\r\n                                                       min_delta=0.01,\r\n                                                       patience=2,\r\n                                                       verbose=0,\r\n                                                       mode='auto',\r\n                                                       baseline=None,\r\n                                                       restore_best_weights=True\r\n                                                       )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
