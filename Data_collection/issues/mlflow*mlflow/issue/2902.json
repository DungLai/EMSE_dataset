you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: n\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Alpine 3.11 inside Docker\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary (pip)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --backend-store-uri <PostgreSQL URI> --default-artifact-root <SFTP URI>`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI run the MLflow tracking server on a separate host than the host that I use to train my models. The code that trains my models calls `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` every once in a while. This makes a request to `/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/log-model` which eventually calls `SqlAlchemyStore.record_logged_model` inside `mlflow/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py`. \r\nThis tries to save a tag with the key of the constant `MLFLOW_LOGGED_MODELS` which has a value with both the previous tag value as the current `model_dict` (if a previous one exists), encoded as JSON. However, the resulting string exceeds the tag value limit of 5000, and this is caught by the `_validate_tag` call inside the function, which in turn raises an exception.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n(Will add this when I have time. I might be due to the naming of some of my things that it reaches the 5000 limit)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nError message shown at the client side:\r\n```\r\n2020/06/03 22:35:23 ERROR mlflow.utils.rest_utils: API request to https://my-remote-tracking-server.com/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/log-model failed with code 500 != 200, retrying up to 1 more times.
