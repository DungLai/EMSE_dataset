I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: docker `continuumio/miniconda3` on Azure's Compute Instance\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: R's `install_mlflow()`\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.22.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI am trying to use MLFlow on Azure's ML Compute Instances to track my experiments in R. The tracking URI set by the compute instance has the scheme `azureml://...` which is not supported by MLFlow. Azure has a [package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-mlflow/?view=azure-ml-py) to enable support on Python, but as my code is in R, I found that I need to manually change the URI to `https://...` to make logging work.\r\n\r\nChanging the Tracking URI works correctly (i.e. I can log params and metrics) when setting the `MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI` environment variable or when calling `mlflow_set_tracking_uri()`, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on the artifact URI (related to #3469) as it is still using the old scheme (the one starting with `azureml://`), so I am not able to log artifacts.\r\n\r\nI see no method on [MLFlow's R API](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/R-api.html#mlflow-server) to change the artifact's URI scheme (and #2577 seems to be related, but I created a different issue as I don't want to re-define the whole URI, but just the scheme) and workarounds are possible at least while Microsoft implements an R API (I hope it happens someday), but I was wondering if MLFlow has any suggestion on this or if a new feature that could help this use-case is in the plan.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [x] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
