Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS 11.6.3\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `python xgb_metrics_bug.py`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nXGBoost comes with a few metrics with @ in their name, e.g. `ndcg@2`, see [XGBoost parameters](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parameter.html#learning-task-parameters). \r\n\r\nExpected behavior: MLflow should be able to autolog all built-in XGBoost metrics.\r\n\r\nActual behavior: when using a metric like this, the following warning is shown:\r\n\r\n> WARNING mlflow.utils.autologging_utils: Encountered unexpected error during xgboost autologging: Invalid metric name: 'train-ndcg@2'. Names may only contain alphanumerics, underscores (_), dashes (-), periods (.), spaces ( ), and slashes (/).\r\n\r\nbut not only this metric is discarded, instead autologging completely breaks, i.e. other metrics, the model artifact and the feature importance plot also are not recorded.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1640908/154653567-1de2e15b-9ad7-4f8b-a9fe-5a7808602916.png)\r\n\r\nI would propose to string-replace `@` with `_at_` in the XGBoost autologging metrics callback so that MLflow is compatible with all XGBoost built-in metrics.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n`xgb_metrics_bug.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport xgboost as xgb\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"xgb_autolog_metrics_bug\")\r\n\r\nfor metrics in [[\"ndcg\"], [\"ndcg\", \"ndcg@2\"]]:\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.xgboost.autolog()\r\n\r\n        train_matrix = xgb.DMatrix(np.array([[0], [1]]), label=[1, 0])\r\n\r\n        params = {\r\n            \"objective\": \"rank:pairwise\",\r\n            \"eval_metric\": metrics,\r\n        }\r\n        xgb.train(params, train_matrix, evals=[(train_matrix, \"train\")])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n- I tried this with xgboost versions 1.3.3 and 1.5.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
