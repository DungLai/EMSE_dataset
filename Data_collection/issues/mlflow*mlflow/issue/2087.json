In particular, I'd like this to be incorporated with the fastai library (built on PyTorch), which also generates artifacts such as learning rate finder plots, and autolog those as well. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nPyTorch is heavily used in research for Deep Learning and is becoming very prevalent in industry as well with the fastai library. The fastai community has over 450 contributors, and it incorporates practical deep learning best practices + cutting edge algorithms in the library. In the fast.ai course that is run by USF, they use Excel spreadsheets to keep track of their runs. If we could just autolog everything once they import mlflow, it will help bring the adoption of MLflow to the fastai community. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nSee above - we propose adding a new mlflow.pytorch.autolog API","closed_by":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2087/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
