I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nMLflow readily tracks code versions for Git projects and includes the commit hash, put this does not capture any uncommitted changes (i.e., quick fixes, parameter changes) to the project. A git diff patch file could be added as an artifact to capture changes.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nSometimes, quick fixes or changes are done on workstations, which is not captured by the saved git hash. Saving a git diff patch would make it easier to reproduce experiments.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThis would be a convenient utility for many in the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nI work in projects with multiple collaborators and servers, where people usually develop their code locally and run experiments in dedicated servers. It is difficult to reproduce experiments if someone forgets to commit their local changes.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nIt is inconvenient to add this manually to every training script.\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
