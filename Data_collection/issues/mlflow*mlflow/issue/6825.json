Willingness to contribute\n\nYes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.26.1\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.5\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**:None\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nDocker container built using mlflow build-docker throws '413 Request Entity Too Large' on inferencing data above 5m. The issue is due to  'client_max_body_size 5m;' set by default in the nginx.conf. This can be solved by increasing the 'client_max_body_size' to 100m, so that nginx can process inferencing medium/large datasets.\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n***\r\nPass in inferencing data above 5m to the inferencing (/invocations) endpoint in the dockercontainer built using mlflow build-docker command.\n\n### Stack trace\n\n'<html>\\r\\n<head><title>413 Request Entity Too Large</title></head>\\r\\n<body bgcolor=\"white\">\\r\\n<center><h1>413 Request Entity Too Large</h1></center>\\r\\n<hr><center>nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)</center>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n'\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [X] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [X] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [X] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
