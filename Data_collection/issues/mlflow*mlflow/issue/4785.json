Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux, Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary (wheel)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: running script provided below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen creating pyfunc model, if at least one of the artifacts added into context contains space, it gets url-encoded into `%20` and the model logging process fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/jovyan/mlflow/artifacts/0/429cf87d064b4dd1b2940770c22c9556/artifacts/logistic%20regression'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the space is replaced by other character, registration succeeds. It happens not only for model-artifacts, but for other artifacts as well.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import
