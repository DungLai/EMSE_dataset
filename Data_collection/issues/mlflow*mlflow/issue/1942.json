Currently, MLflow manually assigns different modules to either conda or pip dependencies. I am proposing we assign the modules to either pip or conda dependencies depending on the user's installation.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nConda isn't always up to date with the most recent modules and frameworks. For example, conda doesn't have TensorFlow 2.0 - this would cause an error in trying to trying use the conda environment returned in `mlflow.tensorflow.get_default_conda_env()`, which assigns TensorFlow to always be a conda dependency. This fix will eliminate this error as the proposed code will detect that the user has TensorFlow 2.0 installed via pip and appropriately assign it as a pip dependency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this change will allow for conda environments to more closely mimic the user's own environment. This can lead to easier debugging and usage of MLflow.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n`get_default_conda_env()` in all relevant model files should be updated to assign module-specific conda and pip dependencies based on user environments.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
