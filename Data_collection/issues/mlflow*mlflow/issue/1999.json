Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip install mlflow\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.3.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.5.6 :: Anaconda, Inc.\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n```from mlflow.entities import RunStatus; type(RunStatus.ACTIVE) == int```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe check on the run_info.status is finished fails because run_info.status is of type `str` equal to `FINISHED` but `mlflow.entities.RunStatus` is actually of `int` type.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n1. `mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow#examples/multistep_workflow -e load_raw_data`\r\n2. Allow to complete and verify it is actually FINISHED\r\n3. `mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow#examples/multistep_workflow`\r\n4. Notice the print statement saying\r\n> Run matched, but is not FINISHED, so skipping (run_id=91cab91e68cf4f45b3c88781fc7000fb, status=FINISHED)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1999/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
