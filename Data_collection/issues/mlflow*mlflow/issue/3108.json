Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ X] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a documented fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description of the proposal (what needs changing):\r\nProvide a clear description. Why is the proposed documentation better?\r\n\r\nBased on my interactions on MLflow slack channel and these related issues—[3086], [3116](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3116) (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3086), [2834](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2834), [2045](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2045), and [3046](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3046)—there seems to be some confusion around two crucial concepts: `backend-store` and `default-artifact-store` usage and its relationshipt with `mlflow` tracking server and `mlflow ui`.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to elaborate with the help of a diagram showing the interaction between the client and the tracking server and how and where MLflow entities are stored, based on backend-store and artifact store arguments. For example, show the following scenarios:\r\n\r\nHow an API interaction and request flow among the client, tracking server, and mlflow ui:\r\n\r\n- on localhost (default backend and artifact store)\r\n- on the remote host (specified artifact store and backend store)\r\n- with/without SQLAlchemy compatible backend-store for both localhost and remote\r\n\r\nShowing how MLflow entities—params, metrics, artifacts—flow and logged among the individual components in these scenarios help readers new to MLflow comprehend and visualize what transpires during a tracking API call. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3108/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
