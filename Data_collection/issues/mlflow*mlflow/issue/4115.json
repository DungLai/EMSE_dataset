Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ x] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_artifact\r\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_artifacts\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nLegal values for the \"artifact_path\" are not clearly described in the documentation for [log_artifact](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_artifact) and [log_artifacts](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_artifacts) methods. For these 2 methods it says \"artifact_path â€“ If provided, the directory in artifact_uri to write to.\" and there is no reference what \"artifact_uri\" is. We should  add content that says that the \"artifact_path\" is a relative path to the experiment's \"[artifact_location](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.create_experiment)\". It cannot be an absolute path.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
