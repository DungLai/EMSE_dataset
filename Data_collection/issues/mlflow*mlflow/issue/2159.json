As it is subclassed, I pass in ```save_format='tf'``` to ```mlflow.keras.log_model()``` which is passed on to the save call in [this line](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b78293ea22be103adcc784d9d0ba6b274486fd37/mlflow/keras.py#L164). The problem is, that in the [line above](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b78293ea22be103adcc784d9d0ba6b274486fd37/mlflow/keras.py#L163) ```_MODEL_SAVE_PATH``` is appended so that the path gets a .h5 extension, fooling keras into trying to save the model as a HDF file in stead.\r\n\r\nAs saving in the savedmodel format is the default in tensorflow 2, I would suggest that the extension be removed when [```_is_tf_keras(keras_model)```](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b78293ea22be103adcc784d9d0ba6b274486fd37/mlflow/keras.py#L144) evaluates to ```True```, optionally after checking ```kwargs``` for the ```save_format=='tf'```.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2159/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
