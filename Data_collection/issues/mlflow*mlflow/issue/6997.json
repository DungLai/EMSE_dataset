Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nI'd be interested in using MLflow from Julia, more specifically MLflow Tracking.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nI have ML experiments in Julia and I'm looking for for some software to help me manage/track/compare them.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nIt would benefit the whole Julia ML community.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nIt would help the iterative process in my research.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nAs far as I know there no integration with the Julia language yet.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ]
