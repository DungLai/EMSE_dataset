Even only logging training metrics every 100 steps, a typical training run at 100k steps produces 1000 datapoints, comparing this across 10 runs yields slow plots in the UI.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nImproving the performance makes it easier to compare experiments/leverage the nice UI.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n* See #2447 \r\n* There's also been some work integrating datashaders into plotly, which scale even better than the webgl backend\r\n* Another option would be a subsampling mechanism for plotting, decoupling the density of plots from the density of logging\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2448/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
