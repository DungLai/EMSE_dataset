Issues Policy acknowledgement\n\n- [X] I have read and agree to submit bug reports in accordance with the [issues policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\n\n### Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n- Client:  1.30.0\r\n- Tracking server:  1.30.0\r\n\n\n### System information\n\n- ** macOS 12.6.1 **:\r\n- **Python3.10**:\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nI'm currently using Papermill to run my notebooks in a loop, and I want to save artifacts to a single run, but a new run is created in the notebook each time. \r\n\r\n`set_experiment` appears to be required, as it will default to experiment 0 which would cause mlflow to crash, since I deleted the default experiment. \n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```py\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://127.0.0.1:5000')\r\n    mlflow.set_experiment(f'Validation')\r\n\r\n    mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"First Trial\")\r\n  \r\n    for i in range(3):\r\n        pm.execute_notebook(\r\n            'model_train.ipynb',\r\n            '/dev/null',\r\n            parameters = dict(i=3)\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen inside `model_train.ipynb`, I have in the cell:\r\n```py\r\nimport mlflow\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(f'Validation')\r\n...\r\nmlflow.log_figure(fig, f\"myfig_{i}.png\")\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What
