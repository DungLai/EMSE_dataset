The code error with:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.RestException: INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE: Missing required field: settings.cluster_spec.new_cluster.size\r\n```\r\nThis is due to [new_cluster](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/projects/databricks.py#L162) being hard coded which do not allow to use the `existing_cluster_id` parameter which [according to databrick](https://docs.databricks.com/api/latest/jobs.html#runs-submit) docs should be allowed.\r\n\r\n### What I tried\r\n\r\nI forked the code and allowed the parameter `existing_cluster` to be sent. However, I got a subsequent error:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.RestException: INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE: Shell command task is not allowed on existing cluster.\r\n```\r\nWhich makes sense since[ it is not part of the existing parameters in databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/api/latest/jobs.html#runs-submit). It might be hidden somehow..\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\ncreate a file named `cluster-spec.json ` with:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"existing_cluster_id\": \"<myid>\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd run:\r\n`mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow#examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -b databricks -c cluster-spec.json --param-list 'alpha'=1  --experiment-id <my_id>` where cluster-spec.json ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1842/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
