Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nCurrently, the create_experiment method uses artifact_location=None as a default argument. It would be better if by default the system tried to read the value for MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI from the environment and uses none if that is not found.\r\n\r\nbasically just replace :\r\ndef create_experiment(name, artifact_location=os.environ['MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI']):\r\n\r\nby this\r\ndef create_experiment(name, artifact_location=os.getenv('MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI', None)):\r\n\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? - Instead of having None as the default value for artifact URI, and then user having to remember where they want their data to be saved and pass it in - it would be easier if the value was read from the environment and None only be used if the corresponding var is not found.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nWe might have a default artifact uri - where all your final artifacts should be saved. In this case, we either set the environment variable or can pass it in. By default, the variable is None right now, in which case it doesn't read from the environment but creates an artifact folder in the current working direction/mlruns. However, many-a-times, especially if the artifact uri is an s3 bucket - its hard to remember the exact path. If the value is read by default, it will be one less thing to worry about the boilerplate - especially for new users. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? We have set out artifact_uri to be s3 bucket. It is hard to pass or remember to pass the artifact_uri every time an experiment is created, especially by users not familiar to mlflow\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) - It is not difficult to fix it. Currently, we have patches for this. But would be more convenient if it was there in mlflow - since it would remove the need for unnecessary patches.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
