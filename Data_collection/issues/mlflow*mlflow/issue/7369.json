The API served is therefore not the old one of MLFlow 1.* but the new 2.* one.\n\n### Other info / logs\n\nOur solution was to switch to version `1.30.0` and use the `--env-manager local` switch. I'm just documenting it here to help others that might run into a similar problem.","closed_by":{"login":"maufl","id":423964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzk2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/423964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl","html_url":"https://github.com/maufl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maufl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
