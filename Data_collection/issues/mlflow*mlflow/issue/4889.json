Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS Big Sur 11.6\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip installed\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: version 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe documentation show https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#built-in-deployment-tools how to pass pandas DataFrames to the model scoring API. The 'split' layout seems to be recommended & the default.\r\n\r\nHowever, it itself responds in the 'records' layout, inflating the returned json (because the column names are repeated for every row).\r\nWith 3.4 million rows, and 6 columns with each more than 15 characters, this causes the following error:\r\n```\r\n[error] 18#18: *21 client intended to send too large body: 7446039352 bytes, client: 172.17.0.1, server: , request: \"POST /invocations HTTP/1.1\", host: \"127.0.0.1:5001\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line defining this behavior is the following:\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/537158f82b9981b5d440ed81dc5c4c92f2c77edc/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py#L175\r\n\r\n\r\nThe docker throwing this was created based on a custom python func flavor, returning a pandas.DataFrame as follows:\r\n```\r\npoetry run mlflow models build-docker --install-mlflow -n my_name -m file:///FullPath/To/my/model\r\ndocker run -p 5001:8080 my_name\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nSending a dataframe similar to, but with 3.4 million rows, where the response is a dataframe with 6 columns each more than 15 characters\r\n```\r\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:5000/invocations -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\r\n    \"columns\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],\r\n    \"data\": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [X] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
