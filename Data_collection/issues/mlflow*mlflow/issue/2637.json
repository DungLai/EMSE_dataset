For unit/integration testing purposes it would be preferable to:\r\n1. Not rely on an MLFLow server being available (both running & accessible via VPN or in docker)\r\n2. Not pollute an MLFlow server with repeated run information about mock expectations / small integration data sets. \r\n\r\nConsequently, the _file_ provider seems appealing as the file could be removed in an `afterAll` block. \r\n\r\nIt looks as though the quickest option would be to write an interface and provide two implementations: a no-op variant and one that uses `MlflowClient`. The _humble_ App object (or a test case) could instantiate the appropriate class based on the URI.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
