I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nYou should make \"**_saved_code_subpath_**\" variable customizable in  **_mlflow.pyfunc.model._save_model_with_class_artifacts_params()_** \r\n\r\nmlflow.pyfunc.save_model() ==> _save_model_with_class_artifacts_params()\r\nIn \"_save_model_with_class_artifacts_params\", saved_code_subpath is hardcoded as \"code\", it should be dynamic. \r\n\r\nAnaconda has a \"code\" module (code.py). This \"code\" module causes problems during the relative import of python files/folders specified via code_paths.
