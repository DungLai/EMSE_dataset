I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nImplement the method `MLflowClient.log_batch()` in the MLflow fluent API as `mlflow.log_batch()` to improve discoverability and prevent users to rely on multiple calls to `mlflow.log_metric()` when logging curves/arrays of values. Alternatively, allow `mlflow.log_metric()` to accept an array of timestep/value pairs and leverage `MLflowClient.log_batch()` under the hood.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nWhen logging metrics, users uses most of the time the fluent API `mlflow.log_metric()`. If the user wants to log multiple timesteps of the same metric (for instance for a curve), then they have two options: 1) calling multiple times `mlflow.log_metric()` or by leveraging the method `MLflowClient.log_batch()`. Option 2 is harder to discover as it requires the user to create an `MLflowClient` in order to find it. That leads them to the use of iterators with `mlflow.log_metric()`, which then translates to poor performance.\r\n\r\n`mlflow.log_metrics` is implemented, however, this method logs multiple metrics while the job to be done here is to log multiple values for the same metric.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nMost ML training routines need to log curves/array of values. However, the method  `MLflowClient.log_batch()` is hard to discover leading users to use `mlflow.log_metric` with iterators. The later leads customers to poor performance.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nSome as above.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\n`MLflowClient` is hardly used (or known) by users inside training routines. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nImplement the method `MLflowClient.log_batch()` in the MLflow fluent API as `mlflow.log_batch()` to improve discoverability and prevent users to rely on multiple calls to `mlflow.log_metric()` when logging curves/arrays of values. Alternatively, allow `mlflow.log_metric()` to accept an array of timestep/value pairs and leverage `MLflowClient.log_batch()` under the hood.\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [X] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [X] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7528/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
