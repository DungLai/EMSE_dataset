I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a link to the documentation entry in question.\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nProvide a clear description. Why is the proposed documentation better?\r\nJust recently used Mlflow in a project both in Python and Java APIs. I should admit it is quite useful and practical but you should really standardize its Java API documentation alongside with Python API. Scala API for Spark is a first class citizen for ML data prep, we had to reverse engineer everything by being improvised in the java api. It was quite troublesome to register models with versioning whilst it is very straightforward in python api with log_model method. I recommend you to ensure the methods in Java API to provide the same functionality as Python API (https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/java_api/index.html) and to provide the Scala/java API examples of each script in the MLflow Examples documentation.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
