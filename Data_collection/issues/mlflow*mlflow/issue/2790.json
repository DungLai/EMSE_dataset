Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nGraphs are often exported as PDF files. It would be great to support PDF files as supported format for file preview when they are logged as artifacts.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? \r\n  - Look at PDF images directly in the UI.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? \r\n  - It is helpful to look at PDF images directly in the UI as it is for other file formats.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n  - PDF are not supported by the UI.\r\n\r\n## Which MLflow component(s) does this feature affect?\r\n\r\n- [x] UI\r\n- [ ] Command Line Interface\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Examples\r\n- [ ] Docs\r\n- [ ] Tracking\r\n- [ ] Projects\r\n- [x] Artifacts\r\n- [ ] Models\r\n- [ ] Model Registry\r\n- [ ] Scoring\r\n- [ ] R\r\n- [ ] Java\r\n- [ ] Python\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI don't know how difficult it would be to support PDF images, but it would be extremely helpful.","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
