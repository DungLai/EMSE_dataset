Willingness to contribute\n\nYes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nSupport a model flavor for Apple's CoreML graph format which is required for running on the iPhone's ANE chip\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nAllow MLflow models to be logged with a CoreMl flavor\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nThe iPhone's ANE chip is one of the fastest edge inference devices on the market, so many ML developers are targeting it\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nOur company's application runs on iPhones and we use CoreML to further accelerate inference times beyond the base CPU speed\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#custom-flavors) around custom model flavors is fairly minimal and there aren't any existing community contributions\r\n\n\n### Details\n\nAs I understand, supporting a new model type requires defining its flavor-specific attributes. The version of `coremltools` used in conversion is an obvious choice, and perhaps the original graph format (PyTorch, TF, ONNX, etc). Are there other attributes that must be specified? \n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
