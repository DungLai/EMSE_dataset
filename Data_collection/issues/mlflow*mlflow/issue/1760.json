Since MLFlow on the client side is not able to set the logged metrics to the tracking server, an exception is raised and the experiment script is aborted.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nI use a remote tracking server and S3 as an artifact storage. The training loss is communicated to the tracking server after each step (approx. 1 per second). After an entire epoch, various metrics are sent to the server and some rather large artifacts are uploaded to an S3 instance.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\nThe server should be a bit more robust. And ideally the client as well. There should be a fallback option that logs the metrics locally if the tracking server is unavailable.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
