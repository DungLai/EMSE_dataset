Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix\r\nfor this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCreating pyfunc model on windows using the `artifacts` arguments results in an MLModel file with windows separators in the paths: \r\n\r\n```\r\nflavors:\r\n  python_function:\r\n    artifacts:\r\n      artifact:\r\n        path: artifacts\\some_artifact\r\n        uri: some_artifact\r\n    cloudpickle_version: 1.3.0\r\n    env: conda.yaml\r\n    loader_module: mlflow.pyfunc.model\r\n    python_model: python_model.pkl\r\n    python_version: 3.6.10\r\nutc_time_created: '2020-04-28 15:59:25.211458'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is portability. E.g. running a docker container fails miserably. \r\n\r\nThe fix is probably to always use forward slashes for this. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow.pyfunc\r\n\r\nclass PythonModelWrapper(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nartifact_path='some_artifact'\r\nwith open(artifact_path, 'w') as f:\r\n    f.write('example')\r\n\r\nartifacts = {\r\n    'artifact' : artifact_path\r\n}\r\n\r\nmlflow_pyfunc_model_path = \"mlflow_pyfunc\"\r\nmlflow.pyfunc.save_model(\r\n        path=mlflow_pyfunc_model_path, python_model=PythonModelWrapper(), artifacts=artifacts)\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
