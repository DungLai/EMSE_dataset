This way, on second run, mlflow re-uses this environment since content of conda.yaml doesn't change. However, conda environment cannot be re-used when it is not successfully setup by both conda and pip.  \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n`conda.yaml`\r\n\r\n> name: xgboost-example\r\n> channels:\r\n>   - defaults\r\n>   - conda-forge\r\n> dependencies:\r\n>   - python=3.6\r\n>   - xgboost\r\n>   - pip:\r\n>       - git+https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow==0\r\n> \r\n\r\n..\r\n`mlflow/examples/xgboost > mlflow run .`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n> 2020/02/20 21:58:30 INFO mlflow.projects: === Creating conda environment **mlflow-605ca3beec0d13ae6e16f10cf433d51db8e58a09** ===\r\n> Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): \r\n...\r\n> CondaEnvException: Pip failed\r\n> \r\n> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/bin/mlflow\", line 11, in <module>\r\n>     load_entry_point('mlflow==0.9.1', 'console_scripts', 'mlflow')()\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 764, in __call__\r\n>     return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 717, in main\r\n>     rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1137, in invoke\r\n>     return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 956, in invoke\r\n>     return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 555, in invoke\r\n>     return callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/cli.py\", line 139, in run\r\n>     run_id=run_id,\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 230, in run\r\n>     storage_dir=storage_dir, block=block, run_id=run_id)\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 132, in _run\r\n>     conda_env_name = _get_or_create_conda_env(project.conda_env_path)\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 462, in _get_or_create_conda_env\r\n>     conda_env_path], stream_output=True)\r\n>   File \"/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/process.py\", line 38, in exec_cmd\r\n>     raise ShellCommandException(\"Non-zero exitcode: %s\" % (exit_code))\r\n> mlflow.utils.process.ShellCommandException: Non-zero exitcode: 1\r\n\r\n`conda env list |grep mlflow-605ca3beec0d13ae6e16f10cf433d51db8e58a09`\r\n>mlflow-605ca3beec0d13ae6e16f10cf433d51db8e58a09     /Users/username/anaconda3/envs/mlflow-605ca3beec0d13ae6e16f10cf433d51db8e58a09\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2455/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
