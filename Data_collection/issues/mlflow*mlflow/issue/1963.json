In order to export it to the Azure ML or Amazon Sagemaker or to create a docker image locally, you cannot specify a dockerfile that could facilitate the creation of a microservice through different steps. Although this service can be done in Azure ML directly, it cannot be done in mlflow.\r\nWith custom dockerfiles you can specify steps for installing different components like compilers or tools of the base image OS.\r\nThis feature is necessary to create customized microservices.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nThey are really small changes, we should make an append of the dockerfile file that creates mlflow with the file that the user passes and this can be the same for all frameworks because right now mlflow is already writing this dockerfile below without the user knowing.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1963/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
