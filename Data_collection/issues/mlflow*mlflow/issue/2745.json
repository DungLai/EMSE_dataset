However there are another deployment strategies specially useful when we do not need an endpoint 24/7 available.\r\n\r\nMore information available in this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nBatch transform is really useful for performing scheduled predictions. By not having to expose the model via API it can lead to a substantial amount of cost reduction. Besides for larger datasets that generate high latency no matter the situation it can be extremely useful.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nChange https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/sagemaker/__init__.py \r\n\r\nAdding functions to create the batch transform using boto3 or sagemakerSDK","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2745/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
