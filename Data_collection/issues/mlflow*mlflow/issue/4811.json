Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [* ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently pytorch model serving works for single input and single output model. To make it generic and flexible, it would be great if it supports multi input and multi output serving.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nThis has many use cases. In fact most of the real world models output multiple features.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ *] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ *] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [* ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI am using a single input - multiple output model in this example using Pytorch lightning:\r\n\r\n`model = CustomModel(args)'\r\n'model_dict = {'input1': np.zeros((1, 256, 256, 3))}'\r\n'input_schema = Schema([TensorSpec(np.dtype(np.float32), (-1, 256,256,3)),])'\r\n'output_schema = Schema([TensorSpec(np.dtype(np.float32), (-1, 2), name='out1'), TensorSpec(np.dtype(np.float32), (-1, 3), name='out2')])'\r\n'signature = ModelSignature(inputs=input_schema, outputs=output_schema)'\r\n'mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model,\"Models\", input_example=model_dict['input1'], signature=signature)`\r\n\r\nWhen this model is served, it throws this error:\r\n\r\n**\"xxxxxxx in predict\\n    \\\"but got output of type '{}'\\\".format(type(preds))\\nTypeError: Expected PyTorch model to output a single output tensor, but got output of type '<class 'dict'>'\\n\"**\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
