Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes -- custom Pyfunc model\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.22.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI am running an evaluation of my model using `mlflow.evaluate` function. Here is the command used:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.evaluate(\r\n    model=model,  # custom pyfunc model\r\n    data=data.head(), # pandas dataframe\r\n    targets=\"label\",\r\n    model_type=\"classifier\",\r\n    dataset_name=\"test\",\r\n    dataset_path=args.data_uri,\r\n    evaluators=[\"default\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\nAnd I run on the following error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"evaluate.py\", line 42, in <module>\r\n    feature_names=[\"text\"]\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/models/evaluation/base.py\", line 807, in evaluate\r\n    feature_names=feature_names,\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/models/evaluation/base.py\", line 317, in __init__\r\n    if isinstance(data, spark_df_type):\r\nTypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple of types\r\n```\r\nThe origin of this error seems to come from this part of the code in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/models/evaluation/base.py in `EvaluationDataset`:\r\n```\r\nif \"pyspark\" in sys.modules:\r\n    from pyspark.sql import DataFrame as SparkDataFrame\r\n\r\n    supported_dataframe_types = (pd.DataFrame, SparkDataFrame)\r\n    spark_df_type = SparkDataFrame\r\nelse:\r\n    supported_dataframe_types = (pd.DataFrame,)\r\n    spark_df_type = None\r\n```\r\nSo if pyspark is not installed in your modules it will throw the above error because `spark_df_type` is `None`. I believe that pyspark should not be a requirement here and that we should have a check before running `isinstance(data, spark_df_type)`\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5335/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5335/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
