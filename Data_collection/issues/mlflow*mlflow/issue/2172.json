But when I log the same file to the same location again but with different contents (like a log file), in the UI I still get the very first content of the file. \r\nI checked the file uploaded to the GCP bucket each time and yes it is uploaded correctly with the new content each time. But for some reason (maybe caching), the MlFlow UI still displays the very first content of that file. However, in the size filed, it displays the new updated file size correctly. \r\nEven when I use the download button from the UI, it gets me the old content. But the actual file in the bucket has the new content. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nmlflow_client = MlflowClient(URI)\r\nrun = mlflow_client.get_run(args.run_id)\r\nmlflow_client.log_artifact(run.info.run_id, LOG_FILE)\r\n# Do some changes in the LOG_FILE\r\nmlflow_client.log_artifact(run.info.run_id, LOG_FILE)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2172/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2172/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
