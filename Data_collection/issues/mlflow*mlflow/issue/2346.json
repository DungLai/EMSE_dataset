System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Manjaro KDE Edition\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.5.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow ui\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen running the UI with `mlflow ui`, I get a warning :\r\n```\r\n[2020-01-25 22:36:20 +0100] [3498] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0\r\n[2020-01-25 22:36:20 +0100] [3498] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (3498)\r\n[2020-01-25 22:36:20 +0100] [3498] [INFO] Using worker: sync\r\n/usr/lib/python3.8/os.py:1021: RuntimeWarning: line buffering (buffering=1) isn't supported in binary mode, the default buffer size will be used\r\n  return io.open(fd, *args, **kwargs)\r\n[2020-01-25 22:36:20 +0100] [3500] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 3500\r\n```\r\nThen when I go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or localhost) in the browser, I get `Not Found`.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nclone the repo, `cd mlflow/examples,` run `python sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py 0 0`, run `mlflow ui`.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nI does not happen when I use a Python 3.6 virtual environment, this must be a Python 3.8 issue.\r\n\r\nEDIT : I precise that I did not use `pip install` to install mlflow, but I built it from the source package instead. I made a PKGBUILD file (for Arch Linux) and installed with pacman (Arch's package manager), since using pip with Arch in highly discouraged. Actually, acxz did it for me here : [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-mlflow/](url)","closed_by":{"login":"andychow-db","id":58712524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzEyNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58712524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db","html_url":"https://github.com/andychow-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andychow-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2346/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
