Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nSince version 1.14.0 the models inference API accepts numpy/tensor input using TF serving's \"instances\" or \"inputs\" format. However, the API does not yet support \"signature_name\" as part of the request. \"signature_name\" is optional in tensorflow serving and is used to call serving signatures of the saved tensorflow model to execute custom logic on request data (e.g. transformation of input data).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nEnables calling a serving signature of a Tensorflow model to do transformations before inference.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nUsers will be able to call custom serving signatures for their Tensorflow models like in TF Serving.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nIn our project, we want to normalize the data before inference.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nFeature is not supported yet by mlflow.\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/utils/proto_json_utils.py throws an exception when passing the \"signature_name\" via the model server REST API (line 195)\r\n\r\n> MlflowException: Failed to parse data as TF serving input. \\\"signature_name\\\" is currently not supported.\\n\"\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nStack trace post request\r\n\r\n> {\r\n>     \"error_code\": \"MALFORMED_REQUEST\",\r\n>     \"message\": \"Failed to parse data as TF serving input. \\\"signature_name\\\" is currently not supported.\",\r\n>     \"stack_trace\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/home/mlflow/.conda/envs/mlflow-7ad5f264a0d35e69dfdd82514dfafa2ea482e888/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py\\\", line 90, in infer_and_parse_json_input\\n    return parse_tf_serving_input(decoded_input, schema=schema)\\n  File \\\"/home/mlflow/.conda/envs/mlflow-7ad5f264a0d35e69dfdd82514dfafa2ea482e888/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/proto_json_utils.py\\\", line 197, in parse_tf_serving_input\\n    'Failed to parse data as TF serving input. \\\"signature_name\\\" is currently'\\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Failed to parse data as TF serving input. \\\"signature_name\\\" is currently not supported.\\n\"\r\n> }\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
