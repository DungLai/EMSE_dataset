I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n\r\n### MLflow version\r\n\r\n- Client: 2.1\r\n- Tracking server: 2.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux\r\n- **Python version**: 3.10\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nIn MLflow 2.0, the method `MlflowClient.download_artifacts` has been moved to `mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts` and the former marked as deprecated. However, the method `MlflowClient.list_artifacts` remains inside of the MLflow client. This creates an inconsistent programming model.\r\n\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nList artifacts:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nclient = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()\r\nclient.list_artifacts(last_run.info.run_id)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDownload artifacts:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfile_path = mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts(\r\n    run_id=last_run.info.run_id,\r\n    artifact_path=\"feature_importance_weight.png\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
