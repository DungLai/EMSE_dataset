I have issues retrieving the model information from model registry REST API.\r\nFor instance, I have a registry named \"test\" with 2 models V1 and V3.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44024922/90332105-72228f00-dfba-11ea-9fab-2f2d18eeb2ac.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I use the API /api/2.0/preview/mlflow/registered-models/list to retrieve all the model information I always get only one model detail.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44024922/90332128-a7c77800-dfba-11ea-9a5a-d9775902a20c.png)\r\n\r\nThe document says all model with status READY is returned when the API is called, is there any way that I can get all the model information via the API?\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","closed_by":{"login":"Nithinbs18","id":44024922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDI0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44024922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18","html_url":"https://github.com/Nithinbs18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithinbs18/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
