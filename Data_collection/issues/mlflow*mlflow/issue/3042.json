Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary / Motivation\r\n\r\nWe store model fit plots (rendered as HTML) as artifacts. Sometimes these plots don't fit into the artifacts viewer (> 500px in height) in which case you need to scroll vertically, which makes for a bad user experience. It would be great if we could just increase the height of the artifacts viewer or make the height adjustable.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nPieces of code that govern the height of the (HTML) artifacts viewer at this point: [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/9ec25f157a548fa8e60ee13e3be5c3d2d513a3d5/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/ArtifactView.css#L2), [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/9ec25f157a548fa8e60ee13e3be5c3d2d513a3d5/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/ArtifactView.css#L56), [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/9ec25f157a548fa8e60ee13e3be5c3d2d513a3d5/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/ArtifactView.js#L286), [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0f7393ec90745864b2beba9f91f684647c10e99d/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/artifact-view-components/ShowArtifactHtmlView.js#L57)\r\n\r\nThe height of text areas can already be adjusted on the fly (within the bounds of the artifact viewer) via `resize: vertical`. Doing the same thing for the entire artifacts viewer is not quite as straightforward, because of all the places where the height is hardwired. And because it's difficult to extend the size of a box at the bottom of the screen (there's not much room for maneuver).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3042/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
