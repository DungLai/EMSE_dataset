Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n  \r\n  - [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n  - [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n  - [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n  \r\n  ### System information\r\n  - **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: `No`\r\n  - **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: `Yes`\r\n  - **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: `binary`\r\n  - **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: `1.13.1`\r\n  - **Python version**:  `3.7.6`\r\n  - **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n  - **Exact command to reproduce**: `python examples/tensorflow/tf1/train_predict.py`\r\n  \r\n  ### Description:\r\n\r\nRunning the example does not capture parameters and also evaluation metrics. It also shows some Info on export signatures like \r\n`INFO:tensorflow:'serving_default' : Regression input must be a single string Tensor; got {'features': <tf.Tensor 'features:0' shape=(?, 13) dtype=float32>}`  \r\nIs this fine to ignore?
