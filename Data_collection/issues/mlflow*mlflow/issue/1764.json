More generally, the design of artifact stores currently does not allow passing any additional keyword arguments from `mlflow.log_artifact` or `mlflow_client.log_artifact` that may then be forwarded to the underlying store a user specified as tracking URI. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nPassing down additional (keyword) arguments to the artifact repositories they register via tracking URI is currently not possible, but would allow users to specify repository-specific settings like server-side encryption for AWS (or storing metadata alongside artifacts on S3, etc). I don't believe this should be implemented as a third-party package. The functionality can be hacked  into `mlflow` via monkey-patching of logging and store functions, but this is highly suboptimal.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n1. Extend `mlflow.log_artifact`, `mlflow.log_artifacts` and `mlflow_client.log_artifact`, `mlflow_client.log_artifacts` to pass keyword arguments down to the artifact repository used. \r\n2. Make artifact repositories (in particular `s3_artifact_reposito.S3ArtifactRepository`) receive and pass these keyword arguments on whereever it is useful.\r\n\r\nI am willing to help put together a pull request (and have some code ready for the S3 case) for this feature, but would first like to pick your brain on this feature.","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1764/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1764/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
