Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: N/A\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: N/A\r\n- **MLflow version: `mlflow_1.10.0` in R on Databricks MLR.\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow_get_experiment()`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI ran the [Databricks MLflow R quikstart notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/quick-start-r.html), which loads MLflow, runs the install script, and executes an MLflow run. After that, I called `mlfow_get_experiment()`, expecting to see the active experiment metadata and associate runs. Instead, I got the following error\r\n\r\n```\r\nError : `experiment_id` must be specified when there is no active experiment. Error : `experiment_id` must be specified when there is no active experiment.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/R-api.html#mlflow-get-experiment for the official documentation for this function.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nThe steps above should be able to reproduce the error.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThere is no traceback in Databricks.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [x] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages","closed_by":{"login":"javierluraschi","id":3478847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzg4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3478847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi","html_url":"https://github.com/javierluraschi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierluraschi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
