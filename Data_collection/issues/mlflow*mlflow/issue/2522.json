These workflows will simply use MLflow 1.7.0. Similarly, Python 2 workflows depending on MLflow versions < 1.7.0 will still work.\r\n* Python 2 users will not have access to new MLflow features & most bug fixes. This aligns with the strategy of other open-source libraries, as ML libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html), [Pandas](http://l/20540), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-hep.org/supported-python-versions), and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.1.0) have already dropped support.\r\n* We may, in exceptional cases, consider backporting critical security fixes to the 1.7 branch and making 1.7.x patch releases for Python 2 users. We don't expect to regularly publish 1.7.x MLflow releases - Python itself has [already stopped accepting security fixes](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#maintenance-releases) (as of Jan 1, 2020) for Python 2.\r\n\r\n## Feedback Welcome\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this issue with any questions or thoughts - we're open to delaying dropping Python 2 support, but would strongly prefer to stick to the end-of-March timeline if at all possible.\r\n\r\nBarring major objections, we'll go ahead & publish an official announcement the week of March 8 - thank you!","closed_by":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2522/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
