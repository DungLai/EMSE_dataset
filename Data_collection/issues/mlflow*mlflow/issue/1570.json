Considering the fact that RedisAI can solve a couple of problems with existing deployment toolkits, and the ease to scale the deployments, it will be really good to have RediAI integrated into MLFlow. Here are some features I think relevant to the AI/OPS community. PS: I am part of the development team behind RedisAI\r\n\r\n- Multiple backends (TF, PyTorch, ONNXRuntime and a bunch of other backends through ONNXRuntime like sklearn, xgboost, coreml etc)\r\n- Multiple devices (CPU & GPU already. TPU & some others are upcoming)\r\n- Language agnostics\r\n- HA\r\n- Redis ecosystem\r\n- Can run everwhere Redis runs (like a raspberry pi)\r\n- Auto batching (upcoming)\r\n- Keep the data local (for example in case of sequence network, you don't have to pass around the hidden data, instead can keep it in Redis itself)\r\n- Clustering\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1570/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1570/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
