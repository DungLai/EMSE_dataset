Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThere's a popular community request to support running MLflow behind a reverse proxy, but it seems like there are some barriers to make that happen. This could be limitations of our documentation or actual issues within MLflow that prevent certain popular reverse proxies from working with MLflow. This feature request is to identify a popular reverse proxy, remove the barriers from using it, and document how to set it up.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nEnable teams running MLflow to run MLflow behind a reverse proxy would be useful for load balancing or setting up authentication. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nMLflow is designed to help teams work together. A reverse proxy can help companies running MLflow on premise to secure their data. It could also allow them to scale up their service through putting replicas behind the reverse proxy.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nFor me this is a bit unclear, but I'm trying to collect together several related issues into a meta-issue we can use to collect and discuss this as a feature. At a minimum it is hard because we do not document how this could be done.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n#2193 #597 #111\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2823/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2823/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
