Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two ways of executing an MLflow project, with conda environment created/changed into at runtime, or without conda, where the existing environment is used. There should be a way to specify what is the conda environment that is to be specified when starting a project. The reason for this is environment creation would be by the user, while MLflow would only activate the specified environment, rather than find and try to download the packages.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n  - Suppose there are multiple MLflow projects that are to be run, each having different requirements, but can be separated into 2 environments. As of right now, using conda to run the projects would create many new environments.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n  - It adds another option for the user and allows environment setup from the user side.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n  - We cannot create environments at run time. We need them to be created and also maintained using our own names prior to any execution. Also, this makes it possible to use MLflow projects without internet, with separate environments for separate projects.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n  - The only two ways of running the MLflow project is to either set use_conda as True or False. There is no way of setting which exact conda environment is to be activated.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2984/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
