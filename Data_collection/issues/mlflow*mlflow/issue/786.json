When I run `mlflow run` with `--git-username` and `--git-password` for a user with token authorization it's failing.  In our organization, it's the strict policy to use token-based auth for GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n```\r\n$ mlflow run --git-username user --git-password token https://github.com/wix-private/data-science.git#mlflow_test/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.1 \r\n\r\n2018/12/30 10:32:37 INFO mlflow.projects: === Fetching project from https://github.com/private/data-science.git#mlflow_test/sklearn_elasticnet_wine into /tmp/tmppMmJHU ===\r\nUsername for 'https://github.com': Password for 'https://github.com': \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/mlflow\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(cli())\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 764, in __call__\r\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 717, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 1137, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 956, in invoke\r\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 555, in invoke\r\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/cli.py\", line 128, in run\r\n    run_id=run_id,\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 171, in run\r\n    storage_dir=storage_dir, block=block, run_id=run_id)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 54, in _run\r\n    git_username=git_username, git_password=git_password)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 297, in _fetch_project\r\n    _fetch_git_repo(parsed_uri, version, dst_dir, git_username, git_password)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 347, in _fetch_git_repo\r\n    origin.fetch()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/git/remote.py\", line 789, in fetch\r\n    res = self._get_fetch_info_from_stderr(proc, progress)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/git/remote.py\", line 675, in _get_fetch_info_from_stderr\r\n    proc.wait(stderr=stderr_text)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/git/cmd.py\", line 415, in wait\r\n    raise GitCommandError(self.args, status, errstr)\r\ngit.exc.GitCommandError: Cmd('git') failed due to: exit code(128)\r\n  cmdline: git fetch -v origin\r\n  stderr: 'fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/private/data-science.git''\r\n\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/786/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
