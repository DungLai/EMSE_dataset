I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Mac OS X\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.12.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow run .`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFLow is mounting AWS credentials into an incorrect directory inside the container, which causes `botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials` exception.\r\n\r\nThis is the command MLFlow runs:\r\n```docker run --rm -v /Users/<user>/.aws:/.aws [...]```\r\n\r\nThe credentials are mounted into `/.aws`, but they must be mounted inside the running users' home directory, e.g. `/root/.aws`, if running as root.\r\n\r\n[This is the code](https://github.com/levkk/mlflow/blob/281f61cabb99867b9641cb6e999e0e13ba006ce2/mlflow/projects/backend/local.py#L282) that hardcodes that path, incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAWS documents this [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#configuring-credentials).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nRun pretty much any example with code that's using any AWS service in any way, e.g. `s3 = boto3.client('s3')` and then try listing a bucket.\r\n\r\nThis is a patch that one can include in their code to overcome this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport shutil\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nAWS_CREDS_PATH = os.path.expanduser(\"~/.aws\")\r\n\r\nif not os.path.exists(AWS_CREDS_PATH):\r\n    if os.path.exists(\"/.aws\"):\r\n        shutil.copytree(\"/.aws\", AWS_CREDS_PATH)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
