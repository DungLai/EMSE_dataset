Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nDeletion of experiment run should ideally not allowed if there is a model from the run registered in the model registry.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? \r\nData integrity\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? \r\nWould be bad to have a model where the run that generated it no longer exists, which potentially included non-existent model artifact if artifacts for deleted run are cleaned on a regular basis.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n[Happy to look into implementation details if this feature is deemed useful / likely to be incorporated]","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
