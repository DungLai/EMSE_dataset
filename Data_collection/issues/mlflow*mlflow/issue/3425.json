Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nWe are training then saving our ML models using `with mlflow.start_run():` and `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()` methods. During the training steps, we want to import some private Python libraries. We are wondering what is the best way to include those libraries in the MLflow model?\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nCurrently, we specify all public dependencies in the conda.yaml, such as sklearn, pip. Then, we deploy our model as a tar.gz file in AWS Sagemaker. In our case, we'd like to install some private Python libraries. More specifically, our artifacts are stored in Jfrog. We are wondering about, is the conda.yaml the only place that we can specify the dependencies (either public or private)? \r\nFor example, we are using a private model library to train my ML model. \r\n`import MyPrivateModel`\r\n`my_model=MyPrivateModel().fit(x_train, y_train)`\r\nWhat would my conda.yml look like? We are wondering do you provide any solution of securely passing in my private artifactory credentials?\r\n\r\nThank you so much!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3425/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
