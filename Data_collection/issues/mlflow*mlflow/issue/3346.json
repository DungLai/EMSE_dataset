Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes I do\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Manjaro Linux 20.1\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.10.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.7.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow run . -P equation=\"1 + 2 = 3\"`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCommand `mlflow run` doesn't parse parameters correctly. It fails when the value of a parameter contains \"=\".\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nHere I have an `MLproject` file\r\n```yaml\r\nentry_points:\r\n  main:\r\n    parameters:\r\n      equation: string\r\n    command: python equation-parser.py {equation}\r\n```\r\nand a python code `equation-parser.py`.\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nprint('got equation:', sys.argv[1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I run the following commands\r\n```sh\r\n$ mlflow run . -P equation=\"1 + 2 = 3\"\r\nInvalid format for -P parameter: 'equation=1 + 2 = 3'. Use -P name=value.\r\n$ mlflow run . -P \"equation=1 + 2 = 3\"\r\nInvalid format for -P parameter: 'equation=1 + 2 = 3'. Use -P name=value.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
