I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 20.x\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.17.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen using `mlflow.keras.autolog()`, an error occurs: \r\n`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'`\r\n\r\nSeems to be because the source imports `keras`, and not `tensorflow.keras`. Since Keras is now part of TensorFlow, should it be doing `import tensorflow.keras` instead, by default? \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cfed457438f6a20b02557e25c0de66f488ec5a41/mlflow/keras.py#L631\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nmlflow.keras.autolog()\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
