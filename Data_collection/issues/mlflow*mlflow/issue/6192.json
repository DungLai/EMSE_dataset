Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nYes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nWe can add a new section in examples/pyfunc and add some pyfunc examples.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nPyfunc is a powerful feature MLFlow offers\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nIt's a nice idea to provide some hands on guidelines\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nPyfunc is a core functionality that supports our deployed models in production \r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nPyfunc has a bit steep learning curve to grasp and digest.
