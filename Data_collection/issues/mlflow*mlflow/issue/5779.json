Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No, this concerns the UI.\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.25.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.10\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow ui --backend-store-uri \"sqlite:///mlruns.db\"`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCurrently, in the MLFlow tracking UI metrics plot, when plotting around 100k points, the plot becomes unusably slow.\r\n\r\nIt appears like no simplification / decimation / subsampling strategy is used and all data points are simply rendered.\r\n\r\nAs I prefer to log metrics at all training steps, this is very problematic. Tensorboard, for example, subsamples the data points at the server-side, making plotting fast. This is configured via a [CLI argument](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/348af4cf9564b8217750e8d84e0b2b89555be62c/tensorboard/data/server/cli.rs#L129).\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to lie in the rendering part, as the large JSON files containing all the metrics loads sufficiently fast.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n- Subsample the data points server-side\r\n- Subsample the data points client-side\r\n- Use an adaptive method on the client side, such as https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler \r\n\r\n### Tracking information\r\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: sqlite:///mlruns.db\r\n```\r\n```\r\nmlflow ui --backend-store-uri \"sqlite:///mlruns.db\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nAny plot with around 100k points.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
