BTW the table output for the ui from the current master git is different from the screenshots in the documentations (e.g. it has the `metrics` columns as one whereas in the tutorial documentation it is split out into 3)\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"sephib","id":8223335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjMzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8223335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib","html_url":"https://github.com/sephib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sephib/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
