Getting the stack trace and any error messages would really help with debugging or understanding failures.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nLong runs that fail towards the end are the bane of deep learning researchers.  It can make debugging very difficult.  A stack trace could really help with debugging.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nThe logging of a failed run stack trace should really be automatic, rather than something that is manually done.\r\n\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThis should be fairly simple: wrap the run in a \"try/except\" block, and then have a \"log_failure\" method that is automatically called when an exception is caught.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
