Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2268.).\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nThe MLproject feature works for R, but this is not documented.\r\n\r\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nSince MLproject is a major feature of MLflow, I think the docs should definitively cover this. Maybe we also want to add a test or two, as this feature is currently not well tested. Note that because of https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3983, it worked only before 1.11.0 and now again after 1.13.1.\r\n\r\nAddressed in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2268 more than a year ago with no feedback from a contributor, positive feedback from other committer.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
