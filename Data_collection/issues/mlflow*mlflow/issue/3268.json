Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Minimal\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 16.04.1 (`FROM python:3.7.0`)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source (with pip)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.9.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.0\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: below..\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen:\r\n* set environment variable for BACKEND_STORE\r\n* human deletes default experiment in UI\r\n* mlflow server is restarted\r\n* open mlflow UI in browser\r\n\r\nInstead of useful UI, observe stdout logged exception with `DETAIL:  Key (experiment_id)=(0) already exists.`\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# /usr/local/bin/python\r\nPython 3.7.0 (default, Oct 16 2018, 07:10:55)\r\n[GCC 6.3.0 20170516] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from mlflow.store.tracking.sqlalchemy_store import *\r\n>>> import os\r\n>>> s = SqlAlchemyStore(os.environ['BACKEND_STORE'], os.environ['ARTIFACT_STORE'])\r\n>>> s.delete_experiment(0)\r\n>>> s = SqlAlchemyStore(os.environ['BACKEND_STORE'], os.environ['ARTIFACT_STORE'])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1246, in _execute_context\r\n    cursor, statement, parameters, context\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/default.py\", line 588, in do_execute\r\n    cursor.execute(statement, parameters)\r\npsycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"experiment_pk\"\r\nDETAIL:  Key (experiment_id)=(0) already exists.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logic around `SqlAlchemyStore._create_default_experiment()` mentions hacks. If I make it a no-op, I observe a successful connection and that `list_experiments()` returns a 0-length list. Maybe it should use `list_experiments(view_type=ViewType.ALL)`? Or force-recover experiment 0? CC @mparkhe @dbczumar this has been the case since PR #860 \r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> SqlAlchemyStore._create_default_experiment = print\r\n>>> s = SqlAlchemyStore(os.environ['BACKEND_STORE'], os.environ['ARTIFACT_STORE'])\r\n<sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session object at 0x7f540da22da0>\r\n>>> s.list_experiments()\r\n[]\r\n>>> [(e.name, e.experiment_id, e.lifecycle_stage) for e in s.list_experiments(view_type=ViewType.ALL)]\r\n[('Default', '0', 'deleted'), ('Default1', '2', 'deleted'), ('/my-experiment', '4', 'deleted'), ('expected', '1', 'deleted'), ('foobar', '3', 'deleted'), ('tf-test', '5', 'deleted'), ('/notebook-tf-test2', '6', 'deleted'), ('/ALPHA', '7', 'deleted')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecovery:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> SqlAlchemyStore._create_default_experiment = print\r\n>>> s.restore_experiment(0)\r\n>>> [(e.name, e.experiment_id, e.lifecycle_stage) for e in s.list_experiments(view_type=ViewType.ALL)]\r\n[('Default1', '2', 'deleted'), ('/my-experiment', '4', 'deleted'), ('expected', '1', 'deleted'), ('foobar', '3', 'deleted'), ('tf-test', '5', 'deleted'), ('/notebook-tf-test2', '6', 'deleted'), ('/ALPHA', '7', 'deleted'), ('Default', '0', 'active')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere *is* a delete button in the UI, letting someone nuke the default experiment. If that's used, we're back to the original state again. Presumably that's what someone did originally, though I can't prove that happened. I can do it myself though:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> [(e.name, e.experiment_id, e.lifecycle_stage) for e in s.list_experiments(view_type=ViewType.ALL)]\r\n[('Default1', '2', 'deleted'), ('/my-experiment', '4', 'deleted'), ('expected', '1', 'deleted'), ('foobar', '3', 'deleted'), ('tf-test', '5', 'deleted'), ('/notebook-tf-test2', '6', 'deleted'), ('/ALPHA', '7', 'deleted'), ('Default', '0', 'deleted')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a POC, so nothing of importance was lost. But it's not an obvious state to diagnose from.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
