Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary (poetry)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.0, 1.24.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: Code provided below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nAttempting to log a model which has regularization applied results in an error, `Encountered unexpected error during autologging: No encoder for object <keras.layers.convolutional.Conv2D object at 0x7f7a264e2610> of type <class 'keras.layers.convolutional.Conv2D'>.`.\r\n\r\nIf the regularization is added without setting the lambda default argument (`layer.add_loss(lambda: regularizer(layer.kernel))`), MLFlow can log the model, but certain architectures in TensorFlow, the regularization isn't applied to the correct layer. For example, the sample code provided below will fail with `AttributeError: 'Activation' object has no attribute 'kernel'` without the lambda default argument applied.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\n\r\nmlflow.tensorflow.autolog()\r\n\r\nmodel = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV3Small(input_shape=(96, 96, 3))\r\nregularizer = tf.keras.regularizers.L1(1e-3)\r\n\r\nfor layer in model.layers:\r\n    if hasattr(layer, \"kernel\"):\r\n        layer.add_loss(lambda l=layer: regularizer(l.kernel))\r\n\r\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mse\")\r\nmodel.fit(\r\n    np.random.randn(10, 96, 96, 3),\r\n    np.random.randn(10, 1000),\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nNo traceback, as no exception is raised.
