However, scipy version 1.8.1 cannot be installed with python < 3.8.\r\n\r\nMy project does not need scipy, so I do not wish to manually install an earlier version to make it possible to use mlflow. I think MLflow dependencies should stay coherent with the minimal supported version (from mlflow's setup.py file).\r\n\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Judekeyser","id":44140459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTQwNDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44140459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser","html_url":"https://github.com/Judekeyser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Judekeyser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
