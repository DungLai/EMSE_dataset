your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:centos \r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.4.0\r\n- **Python version**:3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI launched a MLFlow server for tracking experiment by\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow server --default-artifact-root sftp://username@SAME_IP:/dat/jhe/mlflow --backend-store-uri file:///dat/jhe/mlruns -h SAME_IP -p 12303\r\n```\r\nand log artifact successfully.\r\nhowever, when I tried to get into the experiment to see matrices and parameters from the web ui, it raise the follow error in command line.\r\n```bash\r\n(dev) [jhe@sim03 ~]$ mlflow server --default-artifact-root sftp://username@SAME_IP:/dat/jhe/mlflow --backend-store-uri file:///dat/jhe/mlruns -h SAME_IP -p 12303\r\n[2020-02-23 20:10:54 +0800] [265406] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0\r\n[2020-02-23 20:10:54
