Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix\r\nfor this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n- Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Archlinux (what else)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/a6030d080fd4269c5c1dcc7512a2d7be2777041b\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.8.1.dev0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.7\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow server`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen installing mlflow from the pip package (version 1.8.0) I can run `mlflow server` and the server is started and I can connect with the webbrowser. When I install the dev version (`pip install git+https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git`) it does start the server but the browser does give me a 404. On the console I can see no errors printed.
