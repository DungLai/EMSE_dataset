Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: NO\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Max OS (big Sur)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source (pip install)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.17.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n```client.download_artifacts(run.info.run_id, \"\", local_dir)```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen invoking the `download_artifacts` method, the following exception is thrown ```OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/ml'```.\r\nThe expected behavior- artifacts are downloaded to `local_dir`.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\n# env \r\n# MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=databricks\r\n\r\nclient = MlflowClient()\r\nlocal_dir = \"/tmp/artifact_downloads\"\r\nif not os.path.exists(local_dir):\r\n    os.mkdir(local_dir)\r\nclient.download_artifacts(run.info.run_id, \"features\", local_dir)\r\n```\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThe tracking server is set to DataBricks (Azure)\r\n```\r\nclient.download_artifacts(run.info.run_id, \"\", local_dir)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<input>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File
