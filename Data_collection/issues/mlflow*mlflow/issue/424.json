For example, keep track of an attribute `param_grid` of a grid search. However, I don't want to keep a dump of this JSON outside of mlflow. I tried the following workaround. As is, `log_artifact` expects a filename. Therefore, I dump the `dict` into a temp file and try to log it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as f:\r\n    f.write(json.dumps(clf.param_grid).encode())\r\n    log_artifact(f.name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `mlruns` directory I can find the file generated, but it is empty. Note that the actual temp file (which is kept as `delete=False`) can be found and it is not empty but it holds the right content.\r\n\r\n* What am I doing wrong? Why isn't it correctly tracked by mlflow?\r\n* I would argue that `log_artifact` should support objects as well and keep their string representation.
