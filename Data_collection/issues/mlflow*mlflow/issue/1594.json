System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS Mojave 10.14.5\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 0.8.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.2\r\n- **npm version (if running the dev UI): N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow::mlflow_start_run()`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThis problem exists only with the R API. \r\nWhen trying to start a tracking run by calling `mlflow_start_run()`, the following exception is thrown:\r\n```\r\nError in UseMethod(\"mlflow_id\") :\r\n  no applicable method for 'mlflow_id' applied to an object of class \"c('tbl_df', 'tbl', 'data.frame')\"\r\n```\r\nIt appears that method dispatch is insufficiently implemented for objects of class `c('tbl_df', 'tbl', 'data.frame')`.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n```\r\n# Reproducible test case\r\nlibrary(mlflow)\r\nmlflow_set_tracking('http://myhost.com')\r\nmlflow_set_experiment('test')\r\n# adding a new method for class `tbl_df` results in running code:\r\n# mlflow_id.tbl_df <- function(object) {object$run_uuid}\r\nmlflow_start_run()\r\n```\r\nSee file
