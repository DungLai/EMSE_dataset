For example, the service will return an Amazon S3 location in which the client may place the artifacts. This, however, means the clients will have to know about S3 and must require access to the bucket - requiring specific IAM roles to be configured for client access, which may or may not be feasible.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when looking at it from a deployment pipeline (CI/CD) perspective I would expect my client to be considerably _dumb_ and simply end the model training, fitting etc. with something like `mlflow.deploy(supermodel)`. Which would kick-off a proper CI/CD process and essentially ship my model.\r\n\r\nFor a regular (?) models, this should be pretty straightforward as they range in the order of MBs, right. It'll probably get interesting with artifacts sizing several GBs, though scaling a (new/additional?) component of the tracking service could be a potential fix for that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm very interested about the general and MLflow-specific view on this topic and where it should or could go :)","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/629/reactions","total_count":44,"+1":44,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/629/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
