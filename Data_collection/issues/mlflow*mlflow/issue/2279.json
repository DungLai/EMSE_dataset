We should fix this, starting with metric comparison plots defined in [MetricPlotView.js](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/components/MetricsPlotView.js) - the exact fix may be nontrivial as it's not clear that Plotly supports adding links to legends/tooltips, although [this doc page](https://help.plot.ly/adding-HTML-and-links-to-charts/)) suggests that it's possible.","closed_by":{"login":"Zangr","id":6811562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTE1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6811562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr","html_url":"https://github.com/Zangr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
