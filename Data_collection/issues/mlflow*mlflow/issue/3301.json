Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS Catelina 10.15.4\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.10.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n```bash\r\nMLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=databricks\r\nDATABRICKS_HOST=\"https://westus2.azuredatabricks.net/a\"  # <- note the invalid 'a' at the end \r\nDATABRICKS_TOKEN=\"<secret-token>\"\r\n\r\nmlflow experiments create -n /path/to/somewhere\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nIncorrectly configuring the `DATABRICKS_HOST` variable can lead in certain cases to error messages that are unclear to the user. In the provided example, `mlflow` crashes with the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\njson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the `verify_rest_response` function in `mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py` which only checks whether the returned status code is OK, regardless of whether the response is in JSON format or not. A simple fix would be to check the format as well, and notify the user if the returned format is not in JSON.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=databricks\r\nexport DATABRICKS_HOST=\"https://westus2.azuredatabricks.net/a\"  # <- note the invalid 'a' at the end \r\nexport DATABRICKS_TOKEN=\"<secret-token>\"\r\n\r\nmlflow experiments create -n /path/to/somewhere\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nError message:\r\n```text\r\n \"/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/json/decoder.py\", line 355, in raw_decode\r\n    raise JSONDecodeError(\"Expecting value\", s, err.value) from None\r\njson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [X] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
