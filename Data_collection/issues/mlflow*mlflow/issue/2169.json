Consider the case where a model that undergoes automated re-training and re-deployment degrades in performance or becomes buggy in a way that requires immediate attention. While I am working to discover the root cause of the issue, I would like to be able to easily find a previous version that I know to be in a working state and quickly promote that model to production. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nTo do so, it would be helpful to have a model registry history that displays which model versions were considered the latest model in the Production stage at a given time. This might take the form of an additional column in the versions table representing a \"Deployed at\" time along with the restriction that only one version of a registered model can be marked as \"deployed\" at any given time. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2169/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
