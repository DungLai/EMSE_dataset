There seem to be extremely limited options for customizing or modifying the sagemaker dockerfile.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine if I just set `map_location=torch.device('cpu')` as described in the error text, but I cannot build that into the sagemaker deploy.\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```bash\r\nmlflow sagemaker run-local -m models:/Multi-Vehicle/1 --help\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\n```bash\r\nRuntimeError: Attempting to deserialize object on a CUDA device but torch.cuda.is_available() is False.
