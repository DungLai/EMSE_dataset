Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **MacOS**\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **mlflow, version 1.8.0**:\r\n- **Python 3.8.2**:\r\n- **export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=access-key && mlflow models serve -m wasbs://x-container@y-storage.blob.core.windows.net/mlflow/8/b76bc49b0e42424c8bc3f4341dbdbdfc/artifacts/model -p 5001**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nUnable to serve model stored in Azure blob storage. I can see model files (model.pk, MLmode & conda.yaml) located at the path specified as command param `mlflow models serve -m wasbs://x-container@storage.blob.core.windows.net/mlflow/8/b76bc49b0e42424c8bc3f4341dbdbdfc/artifacts/model -p 5001`\r\nIf I download model.pk, MLmode & conda.yaml files locally and run the command like this: `mlflow models serve -m . -p 5001`, it works. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Use Azure as a remote store to keep models\r\n2. Run an experiment and log model\r\n3. Use the run ID to serve model\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/bin/mlflow\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(cli())\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 829, in __call__\r\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 782, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1259, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1259, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1066, in invoke\r\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 610, in invoke\r\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/models/cli.py\", line 53, in serve\r\n    return _get_flavor_backend(model_uri,\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/models/cli.py\", line 164, in _get_flavor_backend\r\n    model = Model.load(local_path)\r\n  File \"/Users/waqassiddiqi/opt/anaconda3/envs/c-mlpipeline-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/models/__init__.py\", line 73, in load\r\n    with open(path) as f:\r\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/folders/dt/9f6c710j2sq7pybth858lzzw0000gn/T/tmpvm1zvbhq/MLmodel/MLmodel'\r\nmake: *** [serve] Error 1\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
