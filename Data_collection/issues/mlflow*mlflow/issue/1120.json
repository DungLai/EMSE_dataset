This allows them to use Jupyter alongside mlflow on the same host.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the way this works is that mlflow is proxied to a path such as http://myjupyter-server.com/proxy/5000 instead of http://127.0.0.1:5000.  Because there are a lot of references to paths that don't exist, the UI doesn't load.\r\n\r\nI was almost able to get mlflow up and running, I get as far as the \"Oops! Something went wrong.\" page, but nothing beyond that.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\n1. Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance.\r\n2. !pip install mlflow\r\n3. !mlflow\r\n4. Open http://mynotebook.notebook.region.sagemaker.aws/proxy/5000/\r\n5. \"Oops! Something went wrong.\" (Niagra falls.)","closed_by":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1120/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":5},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
