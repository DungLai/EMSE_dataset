Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAdd an `--experiment-ids` flag to the `mlflow gc` CLI (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#mlflow-gc). For each experiment ID that is specified, `mlflow gc` should remove the experiment and all of its runs. \r\n\r\nBefore performing deletion, `mlflow gc` should verify that all of the specified experiments are in the `DELETED` state. `mlflow gc` should support specifying `--experiment-ids` and `--run-ids` at the same time, and `--older-than` should be extended to apply to runs and experiments\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nEnable MLflow admins to permanently remove deleted experiments\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nThe inability to delete experiments means that experiment names cannot be reused and experiment storage space cannot be freed. This FR would address these issues.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nMLflow does not currently offer a way to permanently remove deleted experiments\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
