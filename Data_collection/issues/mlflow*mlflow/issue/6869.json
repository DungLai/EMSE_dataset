Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nMake it easier to find the exact way to search for runName, source name etc. Ideally, provide a mouse-over for the columns on the results table, that gives the method to search for taht thing. eg if you mouse over the 'RunName' column, it will say 'tags.mlflow.runName'.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nMake it easy to enter queries into the UI\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nWithout being easy to search runs, the UI is much harder to use.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nI need to be able to search runs easily.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nNot easy to remember what is the exact thing to query if want to search for run name, duration, etc\r\n\n\n### Details\n\n_No
