Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: I call `mlflow.set_experiment(...)`.\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: python3.8-slim Docker image\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: PyPI\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.16.0, 1.18.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: N/A\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nSetting the experiment name fails. I really don't understand why, but the problem is that entrypoints.py somehow gets a PosixPath it isn't expecting. I'm not sure whose fault this is.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name='experiment_name')\r\n```\r\nThe parameter is *assuredly* a string.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndagster.core.errors.DagsterExecutionStepExecutionError: Error occurred while executing solid \"cyclic_word2vec\":\r\n\r\n  File
