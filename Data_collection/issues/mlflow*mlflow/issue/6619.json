Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nImplement a set_model_version_tag API in the MLflow R client, which should provide equivalent functionality to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/tracking/client.py#L2186.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nEnable R users to set registered model tags.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nNo such API exists in the R client\n\n### Details\n\nFor reference, the existing implementation of set_experiment_tag may be helpful because the set_model_version_tag implementation is likely to be very similar: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/tracking-experiments.R#L115-L129\r\n\r\nTest coverage for set_experiment_tag is located at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/R/mlflow/tests/testthat/test-tracking-experiments.R#L177-L216. Comparable coverage for set_model_version_tag should be implemented in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/R/mlflow/tests/testthat/test-model-registry.R.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
