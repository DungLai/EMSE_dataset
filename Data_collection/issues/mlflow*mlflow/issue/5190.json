Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary (pip)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.22.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: -\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nIf you pass a dictionary variable to the `start_run()` function, it may modify the dictionary. On child runs, the `mlflow.parentRunId` tag is set and updated on the variable, making it persistent for later (non-nested) runs.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nGLOBAL_TAGS = {'custom': 'tag'}\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(tags=GLOBAL_TAGS) as run:\r\n    run_id = run.info.run_id\r\n    assert run.data.tags.get('mlflow.parentRunId') is None      # Should be None\r\n    with mlflow.start_run(tags=GLOBAL_TAGS, nested=True) as child_run:\r\n        assert child_run.data.tags.get('mlflow.parentRunId') == run_id\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(tags=GLOBAL_TAGS) as run:\r\n    assert run.data.tags.get('mlflow.parentRunId') is None      # Should be None\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code raises the following error on my machine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/matheus/mlflow_bug/bug.py\", line 14, in <module>\r\n    assert run.data.tags.get('mlflow.parentRunId') is run_id\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nI believe the issue can be fixed by changing the following lines:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0fa849ad75e5733bf76cc14a4455657c5c32f107/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py#L287-L289\r\n\r\n`tags` is a parameter of the `start_run()` function; it should not be overwritten. By changing the variable name to something else, the problem will hopefully be solved. I will investigate further and open a PR if I'm able to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
