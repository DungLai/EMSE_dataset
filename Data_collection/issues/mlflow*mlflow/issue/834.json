However, it gathers all children of children and so on and displays them at the same offset as the immediate children instead of hiding them.\r\n\r\nFor deep model relationship trees, this makes the experiment table view confusing since there's no visual distinction between what is a child and what is a child of a child. If we could have the same collapsing/expanding and offsetting available for child runs as well, it would be much easier to grok what is going on at what level of the run hierarchy.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/834/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/834/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
