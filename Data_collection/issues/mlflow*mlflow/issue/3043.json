Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.9.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nMLFlow packages do not specify an MLFlow version in the produced conda.yaml: \r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```yaml\r\nchannels:\r\n- defaults\r\n- conda-forge\r\ndependencies:\r\n- python=3.7.7\r\n- fastai=1.0.61\r\n- pip\r\n- pip:\r\n  - mlflow\r\nname: mlflow-env\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may be an intentional feature rather than a _bug_, but it strikes me as a bit odd to assume a package produced from one version of mlflow will work with a newer version? \r\n\r\nIs there some rationale of compatibility here, or should the ability to specify the mlflow version when saving a model by added?
