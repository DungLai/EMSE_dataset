I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.27.0\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS, Ubuntu 18\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.13\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nI have a model that was trained using the Tensorflow Object Detection API and saved with mlflow. One of the outputs of the model is a 1D tensor (i.e. shape=(batch_size,)) and is called `num_detections`. When the code flow reaches the third line of the [following block](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/tensorflow/__init__.py#L544-L549), it fails because the code block cant handle 1D tensors: \r\n\r\n```\r\n        pred_dict = {col_name: raw_preds[col_name].numpy() for col_name in raw_preds.keys()}\r\n        for col in pred_dict.keys():\r\n            if all(len(element) == 1 for element in pred_dict[col]):\r\n                pred_dict[col] = pred_dict[col].ravel()\r\n            else:\r\n                pred_dict[col] = pred_dict[col].tolist()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help contribute a fix for this bug.
