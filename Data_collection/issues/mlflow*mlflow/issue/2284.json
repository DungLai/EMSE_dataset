These introduce added complexity and an extra step of building an image when not required. We should update the Azure implementation to leverage up-to-date Model.package() and Model.deploy() APIs.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nKeep MLFlow's Azure implementation up to date and simplify model deployment.\r\n \r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nModify existing [Azure ML Module](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/azureml/__init__.py#L30) to use new Model.deploy() API as opposed to webservice.deploy_from_image.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new `deploy` API similar to the [SageMaker Module](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/sagemaker/__init__.py#L138). This will use the new [Azure ML API](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.model(class)?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-workspace--name--models--inference-config-none--deployment-config-none--deployment-target-none--overwrite-false-) to deploy the model.","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
