Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution**: MLflow docker image based on 'python:3.9-slim-buster'. Deployed in k8s cluster.\r\n- **MLflow installed from**: official pip \\ pypi\r\n- **MLflow version**: 1.16.0\r\n- **MLflow backend store**: AWS RDS Postgres-SQL 12\r\n- **MLflow artifact root**: AWS S3 bucket\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n- **Command**: `mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0  --port 5000 --default-artifact-root ${BUCKET}  --backend-store-uri mysql+pymysql://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@${HOST}:${PORT}/${DATABASE}`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThis MLFlow tracking server is exposed with a AWS load balancer, and there are other services that load models using this ALB from mlflow. I have observed a significant increase in load time as compared to conventional method which involved model loading from the S3-locations.\r\nFor the service within the same VPC, the time for loading the model using mlflow's load_model() is slightly higher(~5 seconds) compared to the conventional way of loading directly from the bucket (~0.3 seconds); whereas in the other case where the VPC is different, the load time is significantly high (>200 seconds). (Note : The model size is in megabytes.)\r\n\r\nIssue raised in StackOverflow : [[link]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68679258/loading-time-with-mlflow-load-model-is-very-high)\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nlogged_model = \"models:/\" + model_name + \"/\" + registered_version_number\r\nmodel = mlflow.keras.load_model(logged_model)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\nTags\r\n- [X] `help wanted`: Need help from community","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
