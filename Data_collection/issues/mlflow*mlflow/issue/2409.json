Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\nI created a random forest project in pycharm, which include two steps, get_factor.py and rfc_training. I write the two steps into a workflow file. I can run the two step files seperately, but when I run the workflow file, JSONDecodeError raised:\r\n\r\n    raise JSONDecodeError(\"Extra data\", s, end)\r\njson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Extra data: line 6 column 1 (char 57)\r\n\r\nThe error happened in the command:\r\nsubmitted_run = mlflow.run('.', entrypoint, parameters=parameters)\r\nwhere I set the 'entrypoint' as the step files name to execute. I really don't know what's wrong.
