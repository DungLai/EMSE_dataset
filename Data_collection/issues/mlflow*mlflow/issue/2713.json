the script for training is from this repo, the infrastructure is set up\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 19.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Using pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.7.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9001 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minio AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minio123 mlflow models build-docker -m s3://mlflow/1/dec0da53101b41539d3e6d9b35403f35/artifacts/model -n mlflow-wine-test`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nAfter setting up ML-Flow to run in a Docker Container with MySQL and Minio, I wanted to use the `build-docker` command to build a wrapper for my trained model.\r\nHowever, the script breaks with the error message, that `pip` can not be found.\r\nthis occurs when mlflow is locally (!) trying to build the image container. \r\nAs specified in [models/docker_utils.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/3253c77f7945b8e26a7c8aed809a4af5b43261b2/mlflow/models/docker_utils.py#L14), it uses Ubuntu 18.04 as a base image and then tries to setup up ML-Flow using `pip`\r\nIf I am not mistaken, this procudes the crash, as Ubuntu 18.04 does not contain `pip`.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nI used [the elasticnet exampe](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py) to execute a run to generate an according RunId. \r\nIf desired, I am more than happy to provide the according `docker-compose` file, yet I do not think this is the reason for the error - please let me know if I am mistaken :-)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nFull stack trace of the error:\r\n```\r\n2020/04/16 15:39:28 INFO mlflow.models.cli: Selected backend for flavor 'python_function'\r\n2020/04/16 15:39:28 INFO mlflow.models.docker_utils: Building docker image with name mlflow-wine-test\r\n/tmp/tmp2yjjhrsk/\r\n/tmp/tmp2yjjhrsk/model_dir\r\n/tmp/tmp2yjjhrsk/model_dir/model\r\n/tmp/tmp2yjjhrsk/model_dir/model/conda.yaml\r\n/tmp/tmp2yjjhrsk/model_dir/model/model.pkl\r\n/tmp/tmp2yjjhrsk/model_dir/model/MLmodel\r\nSending build context to Docker daemon   7.68kB\r\n\r\nStep 1/17 : FROM ubuntu:18.04\r\n ---> 4e5021d210f6\r\nStep 2/17 : RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends          wget          curl          nginx          ca-certificates          bzip2          build-essential          cmake          openjdk-8-jdk          git-core          maven     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\r\n ---> Using cache\r\n ---> 995b6f92f3dc\r\nStep 3/17 : RUN curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh >> miniconda.sh\r\n ---> Using cache\r\n ---> 837336292266\r\nStep 4/17 : RUN bash ./miniconda.sh -b -p /miniconda; rm ./miniconda.sh;\r\n ---> Using cache\r\n ---> 5b3c460a6c01\r\nStep 5/17 : ENV PATH=\"/miniconda/bin:$PATH\"\r\n ---> Using cache\r\n ---> 7a71b3273f80\r\nStep 6/17 : ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\r\n ---> Using cache\r\n ---> 1891b64ce480\r\nStep 7/17 : ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=\"--timeout 60 -k gevent\"\r\n ---> Using cache\r\n ---> c27ed6cb6483\r\nStep 8/17 : WORKDIR /opt/mlflow\r\n ---> Using cache\r\n ---> 9dae737b8e0b\r\nStep 9/17 : RUN pip install mlflow==1.7.2\r\n ---> Running in e5f5c1966c21\r\n/bin/sh: 1: pip: not found\r\nThe command '/bin/sh -c pip install mlflow==1.7.2' returned a non-zero code: 127\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do hope I am not overseeing something -
