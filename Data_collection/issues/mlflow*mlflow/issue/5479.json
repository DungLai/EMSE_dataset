Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\n[Deploy a python_function model on Microsoft Azure ML](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#id50)\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nCurrent documentation suggests the use of `mlflow.azureml.deploy` method to deploy `mlflow` models into Azure. However, such method is deprecated as indicated on [its documentation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.azureml.html#mlflow.azureml.deploy). The current recommended way to deploy models is using an MLflow plug in `azureml-mlflow`. Documentation needs to be updated in order to reflect that. I already updated the documentation page [in the following branch](https://github.com/santiagxf/mlflow/blob/c302d5c26227402c00bc7975afcb69be06477478/docs/source/models.rst): ","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
