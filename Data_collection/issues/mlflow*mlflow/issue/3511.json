Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Nope\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS Catalina 10.15.7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: `pip3 install mlflow`\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: `mlflow, version 1.11.0`\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: run `mlflow --version` or `mlflow --help`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nRunning `mlflow --help` and `mlflow --version` takes about 1 second instead of running instantly, despite very fast hardware (2019 16\" Macbook Pro with 2.4 GHz Core i9 processor, 32 GB of ram).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```\r\n!#/bin/zsh\r\ntime mlflow --version\r\ntime mlflow --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n```\r\n> time mlflow --version\r\nmlflow, version 1.11.0\r\nmlflow --version  0.99s user 0.31s system 99% cpu 1.300 total\r\n> time mlflow --help\r\nUsage: mlflow [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --version  Show the version and exit.\r\n  --help     Show this message and exit.\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n  artifacts    Upload, list, and download artifacts from an MLflow artifact...\r\n  azureml      Serve models on Azure ML.\r\n  db           Commands for managing an MLflow tracking database.\r\n  deployments  Deploy MLflow models to custom targets.\r\n  experiments  Manage experiments.\r\n  gc           Permanently delete runs in the `deleted` lifecycle stage.\r\n  models       Deploy MLflow models locally.\r\n  run          Run an MLflow project from the given URI.\r\n  runs         Manage runs.\r\n  sagemaker    Serve models on SageMaker.\r\n  server       Run the MLflow tracking server.\r\n  ui           Launch the MLflow tracking UI for local viewing of run...\r\nmlflow --help  1.00s user 0.30s system 99% cpu 1.312 total\r\n```\r\nAs you can see it takes 1 second. And it consistently takes 1 second no matter how many times you run it. \r\n\r\nFor good measure I also ensured that this checkbox is checked:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-09 at 4 35 23 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14482624/95639487-719ff500-0a4d-11eb-9964-d2007bc53997.png\">\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
