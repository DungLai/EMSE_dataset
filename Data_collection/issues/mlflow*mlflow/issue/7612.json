I noticed a significant difference in the way experiments are logged between version 1.27.0 and version 1.28.0 or newer. In version 1.27.0, the results seem to be correct and how I would expect them to be displayed. However, when I update to version 1.28.0 or newer, all of the models are displayed in a cascaded format.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1673\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 15 57 17\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19699606/209711357-c1bdd937-3430-4c13-93ed-f7546a592b7d.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1673\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 15 55 38\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19699606/209711365-97ef50f1-276b-421e-a814-46c16f09f45c.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to generate data required to reproduce the bug\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pycaret.datasets import get_data\r\nfrom pycaret.regression import *\r\n\r\ndata = get_data('diamond')\r\n\r\n# initialize setup\r\ns = setup(data, target = 'Price', transform_target = True, log_experiment = True, experiment_name = 'diamond', silent=True)\r\n\r\nbest = compare_models()\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
