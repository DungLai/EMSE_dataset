I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community. (review migrations)\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nIncrease maximum parameter value length from 250 to 2000 or only limit by request size.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWe use of parameter values longer than 250 characters. Those occur in parameters of naturally variable length:\r\n- URL references\r\n- Definitions of filtering steps: list of qualifiers\r\n- Definition of data augmentations: mapping of transformations to kwargs\r\n\r\nIn #1870 it was proposed to alter VARCHAR limits. It would be nice to not care of those alterations in migrations.\r\n\r\nOur length distribution has some outliers.\r\n```\r\n> select distinct length(value) from params order by length(value) desc limit 20;\r\n11991\r\n11978\r\n11976\r\n11488\r\n11481\r\n1115\r\n1113\r\n1003\r\n902\r\n431\r\n430\r\n396\r\n394\r\n345\r\n300\r\n296\r\n289\r\n287\r\n280\r\n275\r\n```\r\nOne solution for us would be to break apart outliers of >10k and settle on the somewhat [historic URL limit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184/5149834) of 2k.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the VARCHAR limit is dropped while the 1MB request limit stays for sanity. AFAICS a modern database wouldn't have any problem, nor does e.g. [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site).\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [X] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3931/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
