Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nA following up PR will implement the following proposed modifications:\r\n\r\n* allow for the use of a new environment variable, `MLFLOW_CONDA_CREATE_ENV_CMD`, that allows the user to specify an executable to be used for creating environments. If the user does not set it, `conda` will be used. If the user sets it, for example as `MLFLOW_CONDA_CREATE_ENV_CMD=mamba`, then `mamba` will be used (of course, the user will have to take care of installing `mamba` first).\r\n* only one minor change is required, in the file `utils/conda.py`. Tests for this change will also be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\n [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is a package manager compatible with Conda, but many times faster than conda when creating environments and installing packages. When using MLflow, creating the environment can be very time consuming, sometimes dominating the total runtime of an MLflow project. This feature allows to use `mamba` instead of `conda` to create the environments. \r\n\r\nIt only requires the user to set the env variable `MLFLOW_CONDA_CREATE_ENV_CMD=mamba` (after having installed mamba, of course).\r\n\r\nIt also allows, for advanced users, to create a wrapper script or executable that runs only when creating environments. Just point `MLFLOW_CONDA_CREATE_ENV_CMD` to the wrapper.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nIt makes the execution of MLflow project and pipelines potentially much faster, by speeding up the environment creation step without requiring any change whatsoever to the MLflow project.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nWe use MLflow extensively for pipelines, and sometimes the environment creation step is the most time-consuming part of executing a pipeline step. Using mamba speeds up some of our pipeline steps by up to a factor of 10x.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nCurrently it is possible to specify a custom installation of conda, but it is impossible to use `conda` for environment management (listing, for example) and `mamba` for creating the environments. It is not possible to use `mamba` in place of `conda` for everything because commands like `mamba activate` are not available.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
