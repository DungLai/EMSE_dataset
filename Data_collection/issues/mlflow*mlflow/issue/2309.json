Specifically, it is not considered that this parameter could accidentally be passed as a string, leading to the following (funny) outcome.\r\n\r\nConsider the code at [line 252](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/e70d287bcf75ac26d22db287861029ac1a5fa3d1/mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py#L252): \r\n```python\r\n    if code_paths is not None:\r\n        code_dir_subpath = \"code\"\r\n        for code_path in code_paths:\r\n            _copy_file_or_tree(src=code_path, dst=path, dst_dir=code_dir_subpath)\r\n```\r\nIf someone were to hypothetically pass an absolute path as the parameter to code_paths (for example, `/content/myfolder/mymodelcode`), then the string is iterated through, starting with `/`. This accidentally copies the entire file system into the output directory.\r\n\r\n~~I definitely didn't accidentally do this.~~\r\n\r\n### Possible Fix\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    if code_paths is not None:\r\n        if not isinstance(code_paths, list):\r\n            raise TypeError(f'Argument code_paths should be a list, not {type(code_paths)}')\r\n        code_dir_subpath = \"code\"\r\n        for code_path in code_paths:\r\n            _copy_file_or_tree(src=code_path, dst=path, dst_dir=code_dir_subpath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe documentation is plenty clear about this (\"code_paths â€“ A **list** of local filesystem paths\"), but given the possible outcome, it might be helpful regardless.","closed_by":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2309/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
