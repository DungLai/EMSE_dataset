Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: \r\nNo\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\nLinux RHEL 8.2\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\nPyPi (pip install mlflow)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n1.10.0\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen i click on the “Models” navigation tab. The UI shows the puddle with “Something went wrong” after displaying the error \"500 Internal Server Error Internal Server Error The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.\". \r\n\r\nIt looks like the ORDER BY statement calls out “registered_models.name ASC” twice\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n- Install MLFlow\r\n- Install PyODBC\r\n- Install ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\r\n- Start MLFlow\r\n- Click the \"Models\" navigation tab\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/db/utils.py\", line 76, in make_managed_session\r\n    yield session\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/model_registry/sqlalchemy_store.py\", line 331, in search_registered_models\r\n    sql_registered_models = query.all()\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 3233, in all\r\n    return list(self)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 3389, in __iter__\r\n    return self._execute_and_instances(context)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 3414, in _execute_and_instances\r\n    result = conn.execute(querycontext.statement, self._params)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 982, in execute\r\n    return meth(self, multiparams, params)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/sql/elements.py\", line 293, in _execute_on_connection\r\n    return connection._execute_clauseelement(self, multiparams, params)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1095, in _execute_clauseelement\r\n    ret = self._execute_context(\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1249, in _execute_context\r\n    self._handle_dbapi_exception(\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1476, in _handle_dbapi_exception\r\n    util.raise_from_cause(sqlalchemy_exception, exc_info)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/util/compat.py\", line 398, in raise_from_cause\r\n    reraise(type(exception), exception, tb=exc_tb, cause=cause)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/util/compat.py\", line 152, in reraise\r\n    raise value.with_traceback(tb)\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1245, in _execute_context\r\n    self.dialect.do_execute(\r\n  File \"/opt/app-root/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/default.py\", line 588, in do_execute\r\n    cursor.execute(statement, parameters)\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (pyodbc.ProgrammingError) ('42000', '[42000] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]A column has been specified more than once in the order by list.
