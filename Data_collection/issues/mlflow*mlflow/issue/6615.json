Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nImplement a searchModelVersions API in the MLflow Java client with equivalent behavior to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/tracking/client.py#L2700.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nEnable Java users to search for registered model versions.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nNo such API exists in the Java client\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nFor reference, the existing implementation of searchExperiments may be helpful because the searchModelVersions implementation is likely to be very similar: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/java/client/src/main/java/org/mlflow/tracking/MlflowClient.java#L275-L280\r\n\r\nTest coverage for searchExperiments is located here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/java/client/src/test/java/org/mlflow/tracking/MlflowClientTest.java#L154-L233; comparable coverage should be introduced for `searchModelVersions`, though fewer API arguments should result in a smaller test.\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ]
