Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nImplement a search_model_versions API in the MLflow R client with equivalent behavior to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/tracking/client.py#L2700.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nEnable R users to search for registered model versions.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nNo such API exists in the R client\r\n\n\n### Details\n\nFor reference, the existing implementation of list_registered_models may be helpful because the search_model_versions implementation is likely to be very similar: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/0645f9228b874e0b1d9f37cb0a0761c0736fea30/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model-registry.R#L133-L153\r\n\r\nExisting tests are located here:
