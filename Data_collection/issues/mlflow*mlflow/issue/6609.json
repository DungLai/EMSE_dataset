I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nUse Vertica database as a MLFlow tracking server to store the experiment parameters, model versions and other metrics. \r\n\r\nVertica has an sql alchemy dialect(https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-vertica-python/) that we can use to connect to the database. Vertica has in-database machine learning capability and it also has Verticapy python library which has scikit like functionality to conduct data science projects on data stored in Vertica (Without moving the data out of Vertica). \r\n\r\nMl flow can be used to track the performance and other parameters of the in-database ML models.  \r\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nTo use Vertica DB as a tracking server for the ML models inside Vertica DB. \r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nVertica can perform analytics very fast(MPP architecture). Having Vertica as a tracking server will help MLfow users to perform analytics on their experiment data and make better decision on choosing the ML model for production. \r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nVertica customer who are in the MLOps domain would like to store the experiment parameters metrics and versions when developing/ training ML models inside Vertica using verticapy python library.\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nCurrently Vertica is not supported as a tracking server. \n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [X] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
