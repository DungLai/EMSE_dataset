Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time. It might change.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAdd a _mlflow.set_artifact_uri_ to update artifact uri which change in my workflow. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nIn my workflow I want to change where the model is stored based on some results. I have a local artifactory. When I think that my models need to be shared, I want to push them to a served instance of **MLFLOW**.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nFor now, i set it with **mlflow.create_experiment** with _artifact_location_ arguments.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nHelp a smoother worflow setup.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nI don't see another way of doing diffently, with _mlflow.create_experiment_\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [x] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3469/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
