Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nLinking directly to an artifact view in the mlflow client ui. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen creating custom html views, it would be nice to share links directly to these artifacts or even better, having the ability to see the artifact as a page on its own. An example would be a GAN that generates art, a html view that showed some examples of the art.\r\n\r\nAt the moment you have to scroll and potentially search for the artifact you want.
