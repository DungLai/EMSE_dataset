Addition of log scales button in different panes of the Mlflow ui.\r\n2. Alphabetically order lists in the Mlflow ui.\r\n3. Propose box_plot graphics in some specific cases (Scatter)\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nImprove the readability of the models results \r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThis will allow to better discriminate models results in a framework of a grid search / random search.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nThis would allow to see things that we cannot identify at this time.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\ngraphically, it is impossible (in some cases) to see/distinguish things using the current graphical representation.\r\nAdding the features such as log scales for x and y in various screens and adding box_plot representation whould be some great help.\r\n\r\n**Case 1:  Parallel Coordinates Plot : Add  axis Log scale for metric and/or Parameters.**\r\n![ml_flow_coordinates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172327153-30fc505d-5caf-4dde-b083-0850fd3be73d.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Case 2 : Scatter plot for factor parameters. - Add log scales on X and Y axis  AND propose box_plot option (button)**\r\non the below graphic all points are aggregated. a box_plot would help comparing the results. this is typically the case when we want to know if, in  a random search a parameter is set with factors (True false for instance ). Box_plot will allow to see things better.\r\n\r\n![ml_flow_scatter_plot_Xaxis_factors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172327144-31111610-d37e-438f-a7e3-1a2dfd45e4d5.JPG)\r\nProposal :\r\n![Ml_flow_box_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172332021-1925f074-ba5e-4a0b-bf38-6dc36600efe7.png)\r\n\r\n**Case 3 :  Parallel Coordinates Plot : Sort alphabetically the Parameters and Metrics**\r\n![ml_flow_parallel_coord_alpha_order_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172327147-82266ec1-ca2c-439a-b66a-6d63b8791f53.JPG)\r\n![ml_flow_parallel_coord_alpha_order](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172327149-42906cce-52d8-4157-9098-429b02f119ca.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Case 4 : Contour Plot - Add log scales on X and Y axis** \r\n![ml_flow_contour_plot_log_scales](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172327129-35b01be5-76b9-48e5-b8f5-3593d211ea17.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Details\n\nAll previous requested features are already implemented in the MLflow interface (log scales and alphabetically orders), so there is specific recommendation on how to do it.\r\n\r\nThe use of box plot (for categorical parameters) can be done this way :\r\n**instead of having this :**\r\n![ml_flow_scatter_plot_Xaxis_factors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172333021-5d66d75f-f949-415d-92d1-946b9cd686d3.JPG)\r\n\r\n**get that :**\r\n![Ml_flow_box_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55460547/172332824-3cac5600-4de2-4f94-aaf7-e5bf7f55534f.png)\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nCheers Gilles.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
