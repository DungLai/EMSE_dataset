Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: no\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Pop!_OS 20.10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: echo \"from mlflow.tracking.client import MlflowClient\" > test_ml.py && pytest test_ml.py \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen I use MLflow with numpy 1.20.0 (released a few days ago), I get the following types of warnings:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n=============================== warnings summary ===============================\r\n../../../../../../../miniconda3/envs/rs-cloud/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/types/schema.py:47\r\n  /home/aloosley/miniconda3/envs/rs-cloud/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/types/schema.py:47: DeprecationWarning: `np.object` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `object`. To silence this warning, use `object` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. \r\n  Deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations\r\n    binary = (7, np.dtype(\"bytes\"), \"BinaryType\", np.object)\r\n\r\n-- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/warnings.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because numpy has deprecated the usage of `np.object` (and `np.int`, `np.float`, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nAdd \r\n```python\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking.client import MlflowClient\r\n```\r\nto any test_xxx.py file and run pytest.  Then the Deprecation warning appears.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nI have created a simple fix PR [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4045), but I am unable to get precommit hooks to work and do the file reformatting to get everything running.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4048/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
