Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\nEnable `mlflow.log_params` to log parameters with length over 250 characters.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nWe use `mlflow.log_params` to log parameters in the training pipeline.\r\nThe parameters could be hyperparameters or which text columns to used for the model. Some of the parameters have long names which may come from another platform like ETL which causes the following error:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Param value '[...' had length 376, which exceeded length limit of 250\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n    1. It would be easier for pytorch lightning users to log parameters with length over 250 characters. Please find the below issue and the PR accordingly.\r\n    https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/5892\r\n    https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/5893\r\n    2. We also found the same feature requests in the past:\r\n    https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1976\r\n    https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3931\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nIf it is possible for `mlflow.log_params` to expand the length limit, it would be easier for us to manage logs across platforms.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nTo achieve this use case, we need to build another logger to maintain the logs.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
