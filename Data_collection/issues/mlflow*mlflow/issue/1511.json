Within https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/pyfunc/backend.py there is a function called copy_model_into_container, which creates some text for a dockerfile. I think that in the line \"COPY {model_dir} /opt/ml/model\" {model_dir} is in Windows filepath syntax whereas I think it needs to be in Linux filepath syntax (i.e. the \\  and / switched).\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nError log when creating the dockerfile :\r\nStep 16/19 : COPY model_dir\\model /opt/ml/model\r\nCOPY failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder547184212/model_dirmodel: no such file or directory\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
