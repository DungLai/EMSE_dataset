Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: `1.20.2` (skinny)\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\nin an airflow DAG/python file\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWe are using Airflow to orchestrate some operations against our MLFlow deployment. All DAGs that import MLFlow fail to\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\npython dag file:\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\ndef train_model():\r\n  # ...\r\n  pass\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\"my_dag\",\r\n  start_date=datetime(2021, 1 ,1),\r\n  schedule_interval='@daily',\r\n) as dag:\r\n  PythonOperator(\r\n    task_id=f\"training_model\",\r\n    python_callable=train_model,\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tasks in this dag will execute but it appears to overwrite the existing logging handlers and prevent all tasks within the DAG from sending the logs to s3 on `close`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nAn issue was opened in the airflow project but airflow maintainers think that it is an issue with the MLFlow logging code.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/12236\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4957/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4957/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
