Artifacts are stored in s3. Everything seems to be working in the sense that I can load up the mlflow start page, see the different experiments and they get populated with respective metadata. However, when I click on a run to view (i.e. to look at the metrics or artifacts) it crashes and i get the Oops Niagra Falls page. Going into the deployed docker image, all files are present and metadata is being populated and updated. \r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to load resource: http://1234.elasticbeanstalk.com/ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/artifacts/list?run_uuid=1234 the server responded with a status of 500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"rami3e","id":28493835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDkzODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28493835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e","html_url":"https://github.com/rami3e","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rami3e/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1435/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
