Logging tags, parameters and metrics works without errors. These are also displayed and visualized in the UI.\r\nOnly if you want to unfold an artifact folder, you get the MLFlow error page. This happens with every artifact.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n/\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThere is no error on the log of the server side\r\n\r\nHere the logs from the WebConsole:\r\n```\r\nreact-dom.production.min.js:151 Error: Can't find child.\r\n    at ArtifactUtils.js:50\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Function.value (ArtifactUtils.js:46)\r\n    at t.value (ArtifactView.js:190)\r\n    at t.value (ArtifactView.js:57)\r\n    at f (react-dom.production.min.js:131)\r\n    at beginWork (react-dom.production.min.js:138)\r\n    at i (react-dom.production.min.js:176)\r\n    at a (react-dom.production.min.js:176)\r\n    at _ (react-dom.production.min.js:182)\r\n```\r\nHere you see the Scope at the findChild function: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b47a390356aab3868d0c7299133a82fbdc1ee53e/mlflow/server/js/src/utils/ArtifactUtils.js#L43\r\n\r\nIn a healthy installation, the path starts after default-artifact-root.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7436938/66049012-e7b07880-e52a-11e9-957d-358386fe34aa.png)","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1895/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
