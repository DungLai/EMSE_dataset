Other model types may be affected as well.\r\n\r\nPython 3.8 added support for pickle protocol 5, but does not sue it by default.\r\nPython 3.7 or lower does not support \"pickle protocol: 5\".\r\nHowever, MLflow uses `cloudpickle` for pickling which defaults to the *highest* protocol version. So when saving models on python 3.8, the models are saved using pickle protocol 5.\r\nWhen loading such models under python 3.7, the load fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\nload_model\r\n\r\n  File \"/usr/local/google/home/avolkov/miniconda3/envs/py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py\", line 667, in load_model\r\n    model_impl = importlib.import_module(conf[MAIN])._load_pyfunc(data_path)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/google/home/avolkov/miniconda3/envs/py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py\", line 461, in _load_pyfunc\r\n    return _load_model_from_local_file(path=path, serialization_format=serialization_format)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/google/home/avolkov/miniconda3/envs/py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py\", line 419, in _load_model_from_local_file\r\n    return cloudpickle.load(f)\r\nValueError: unsupported pickle protocol: 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps MLflow should not be using `cloudpickle` by default for model saving.\r\nCloudPickle officially discourages this: \"Using cloudpickle for long-term object storage is not supported and strongly discouraged.\"\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes.
