Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS Catalina\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Installed wtih pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.25.1 (happens on 1.24.0 as well)\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: None\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: Any `load_model` for a model that was saved with `code_paths` arguments would suffice:\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.sklearn.save_model(model, model_path, serialization_format=\"cloudpickle\", code_paths=extra_code_paths). # this parameter of code_paths is only available in 1.25.0 forward\r\nmlflow.sklearn.load_model(model_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nA model saved with extra paths can be used to supply local code that is not available as part of a public library (such as an inner library), which is supplied when saving the model using the `code_paths` argument.\r\nThis causes the actual directories to be copied into the mlflow model directory under a specified `code` directory, and added to the relevant flavor configurations as well for future loading.\r\nWhen loading the model, these paths inside the `code` directory are added to the system path so that imports of these files would work OOTB.\r\nUnfortunately, the code that is in charge of retrieving the relevant code directories under `code` has a small bug which causes this not to work.\r\nFor example, if my sklearn model depends (for example, as a preprocessor) on a a local file inside a private library, let's assume its path is it `private_module.private_code_file`, I would add the directory that contains this `private_module` as a code path so that this import would work when loading the model. However, I'm receiving a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'private_module'` error instead.\r\n\r\nThis is because the relevant function `_get_code_dirs` has a small bug in [this line](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/v1.25.1/mlflow/utils/model_utils.py#L90):\r\n```python\r\nreturn [\r\n    (os.path.join(dst_code_path, x))\r\n    for x in os.listdir(src_code_path)\r\n    if os.path.isdir(x) and not x == \"__pycache__\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\nSpecifically, the error is at\r\n```python\r\nif os.path.isdir(x) and not x == \"__pycache__\"\r\n```\r\nWhich checks that the `x` variable is a directory, which is simply a string of a directory under the `code` directory.\r\nInstead, we should check that the full path is a directory:\r\n```python\r\nif os.path.isdir(os.path.join(src_code_path, x)) and not x == \"__pycache__\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.sklearn.save_model(model, model_path, serialization_format=\"cloudpickle\", code_paths=[\"path/to/directory/containing/private_module\"). # this parameter of code_paths is only available in 1.25.0 forward\r\nmlflow.sklearn.load_model(model_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThis happens any time a model is trying to be loaded - \r\n* When loading the model using `load_model(model_path)`\r\n* When trying to serve it using `mlflow models serve <model_path>`\r\n* When testing it runs in a sagemaker container (build using `mlflow sagemaker build-and-push-container --no-push) and then running `mlflow sagemaker run-local <model_path>`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [X] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [X] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5786/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
