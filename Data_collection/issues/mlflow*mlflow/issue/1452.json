However, when performing large scale experiments with hundreds or thousands of jobs in parallel, this is a problem due to blocked connections by the database servers when exceeding the maximum number of connections. I could not find a way to parameterize mlflow to overcome this issue, e.g. by decreasing the used connection pool size. Adding these parameters as key-value-pair at the end of the database URL didn't work either.\r\n\r\nThis is only one parameter which could be useful to be able to parameterize.
