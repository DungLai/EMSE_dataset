Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMlflow model registry allows users to load models using models URI. One format of the models URI is `models:/<model_name>/<stage>`, for example, `models:/regressor/Production`.\r\n\r\nModel registry has been accepting case insensitive model URIs, like `models:/regressor/production`, in mlflow < 1.23.0.\r\n\r\nBut after the bug introduced in mlflow 1.23.0 (by PR #5027), referencing models by stage suddenly became case sensitive. To reference the latest Production version of model `regressor`, only this format is working:\r\n* `models:/regressor/Production`\r\n\r\nThese formats are no longer working:\r\n* `models:/regressor/production`\r\n* `models:/regressor/pRoduction`\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [x] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lichenran1234","id":5786126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODYxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5786126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234","html_url":"https://github.com/lichenran1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichenran1234/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5311/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
