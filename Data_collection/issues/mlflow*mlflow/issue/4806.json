Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\nI'm comfortable making the backend changes but may need assistance for UI updates.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe model registry currently offers a \"compare\" view across registered versions which is very helpful. However, it is most helpful if we only want to have a detailed comparison for the few latest registered model versions. I would like the ability to **view the evolution of a metric (e.g. model accuracy) over the lineage of a registered model**. Ideally, we can select a single metric of interest and plot this metric value on the y axis with the model version on the x-axis.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nFor a given registered model, I want to have visibility on how the model behavior is changing over time as we ship and deploy new versions. Do we see a dip in accuracy for the latest stage model that should be reviewed before promoting the model stage to production? Is there a long term trend for a given metric of interest? It's hard to have this sort of visibility from the UI currently.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n- The compare view becomes awkward to use when we've selected 10+ model versions. It may be useful to add a new component to the `/models/registered_model_name` page which is focused on plotting metrics over all versions.\r\n- The user should be able to select a metric and plot using either (1) model version or (2) training run timestamp for the x axis.\r\n- Model versions which don't have a value for the selected metric should be transparently excluded from the plot.\r\n- [optional] It would be nice to color (and toggle visibility for) model versions based on their stage.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4806/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
