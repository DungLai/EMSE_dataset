Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nBeing able to identify a custom `predict_proba` function from a custom pyfunc model to be able to fully use the \"default\" evaluators with pyfunc models and not only with sklearn models.\r\n \r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nIncrease the range of models that can use the \"default\" evaluators when running `mlflow.evaluate`\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nIt is I believe something easy to unlock that could be used by anyone building their own custom model with pyfunc\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nWe would like to use all the evaluators in the group of \"default\" evaluators with our custom pyfunc classifier.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nThis is currently not easy to achieve as we would have to define our own evaluators.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI propose to modify [this function](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/af1df139aa107830fbfbc79e515df15f8f6e9f55/mlflow/models/evaluation/default_evaluator.py#L40) in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/models/evaluation/default_evaluator.py to just detect a `predict_proba` within a pyfunc model.\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here.
