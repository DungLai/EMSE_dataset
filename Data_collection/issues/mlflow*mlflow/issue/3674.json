The problem is that various of the static assets don't load and fail with ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1409\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-11-11 at 19 40 05\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/244059/98856817-0d11f480-2456-11eb-88d2-1564ac8ef1d1.png\">\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's the IAP tunnel here that's causing the issue? It seems strange that no-one else seems to have encountered this and I guess the combination of a GCP IAP tunnel and mlflow is fairly rare.\r\n\r\nI have discovered that moving from the 'sync' worker to the 'gevent' worker fixes it. The gunicorn [docs](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/design.html#choosing-a-worker-type) state that, \"[..] we require a buffering proxy in front of a default configuration Gunicorn\" which obviously I don't have in this scenario.\r\n\r\nSwitching to the `gevent` type of worker by adding `--gunicorn-opts \"-k gevent\"` does the trick.\r\n\r\nI'm logging this a) in case it helps anyone else (I spent ages troubleshooting this) but also I'm wondering why `sync` is the default worker type? Are there any drawbacks to using `gevent` that I might encounter?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3674/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
