Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nI have launched MLFlow using a custom MLFlow operator which deploys a bunch of \"instances\" of MLFlow via kustomize. In order to provide a rough multi-tenancy all instances of MLFlow are behind Istio + Envoy using https://github.com/ibm-cloud-security/app-identity-and-access-adapter which works great. Now for each of the instances I can pass an Active Directory group (or other headers) and only that group will get access to a particular instance. The problem is when I want to grant programmatic access to an instance via say a jupyter notebook in kubeflow. \r\n\r\nI have this working in curl but unsure how this would work with the mlflow python sdk. I did notice that Azure Databricks does similar things and expects a header to be present so wondering if MLFlow would consider the ability to pass custom headers when it makes a request? The following is a successful curl command and just curious how could make this work with the MLFlow python sdk?\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl -v --cookie \"oidc-cookie-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX=XXXXXXXXXX\" https://mlflow-sample.example.ca/api/2.0/preview/mlflow/experiments/list\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
