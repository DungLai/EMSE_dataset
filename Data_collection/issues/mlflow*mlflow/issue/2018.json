Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.2.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.5.2\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nHey there! When I load the UI in community edition, I see the experiment just fine! However, when I click on the loss metric, I get: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8398819/67834092-b08aa400-faa3-11e9-875f-6fea7774c21e.png)\r\n\r\nThis screen loads forever. It's possible that this is \r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatabricks configure\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>> import mlflow\r\n>>> mlflow.set_tracking_uri('databricks')\r\n>>> mlflow.set_experiment('/Users/ankit96@stanford.edu/test-mlflow-experiment')\r\n>>> with mlflow.start_run():\r\n...     mlflow.log_metric('loss', 0.1)\r\n...     mlflow.log_param('test_param', 'resnet50')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI first thought it might be tied to the number of metrics. So, I also tried: \r\n```\r\n>>> import mlflow\r\n>>> mlflow.set_tracking_uri('databricks')\r\n>>> mlflow.set_experiment('/Users/ankit96@stanford.edu/test-mlflow-experiment')\r\n>>> with mlflow.start_run():\r\n...     mlflow.log_metric('loss', 0.1)\r\n...     mlflow.log_metric('loss', 0.2)\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems like even when logging multiple values, I get a spinning screen when I click on the metric.\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ankmathur96","id":8398819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96","html_url":"https://github.com/ankmathur96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
