I am providing the traceback of the container. I am running on a local Kubernetes cluster (minikube). I did not edit the kubernetes_job_template.yaml. I've edited the kubernetes_config.json to point to my kube-context and to my repository. Is there anything else that I should be doing (like volume mounts etc.) otherwise this is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n2019/11/08 14:05:36 INFO mlflow.projects: === Building docker image macimovic/mlflow-kubernetes-example:7fd12b4 ===\r\n2019/11/08 14:05:36 INFO mlflow.projects.kubernetes: === Pushing docker image macimovic/mlflow-kubernetes-example:7fd12b4 ===\r\n2019/11/08 14:05:50 INFO mlflow.projects: === Created directory /tmp/tmpso5eg5at for downloading remote URIs passed to arguments of type 'path' ===\r\n2019/11/08 14:05:50 INFO mlflow.projects.kubernetes: === Creating Job docker-example-2019-11-08-14-05-50-362961 ===\r\n2019/11/08 14:05:50 INFO mlflow.projects.kubernetes: Job started.\r\n2019/11/08 14:05:55 INFO mlflow.projects.kubernetes: Job has reached the specified backoff limit\r\n2019/11/08 14:05:55 ERROR mlflow.cli: === Run (ID '3ddb5f0527674fe3b396e4300c946868') failed ===\r\n\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 53, in <module>\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\", line 121, in start_run\r\n    active_run_obj = MlflowClient().get_run(existing_run_id)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 92, in get_run\r\n    return self._tracking_client.get_run(run_id)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 47, in get_run\r\n    return self.store.get_run(run_id)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/file_store.py\", line 395, in get_run\r\n    run_info = self._get_run_info(run_id)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/file_store.py\", line 411, in _get_run_info\r\n    databricks_pb2.RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST)\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Run '3ddb5f0527674fe3b396e4300c946868' not found\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"macimovic","id":52063794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDYzNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52063794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic","html_url":"https://github.com/macimovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macimovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2060/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
