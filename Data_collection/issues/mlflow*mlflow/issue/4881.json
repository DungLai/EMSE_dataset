Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nSupport running of a MLproject on an existing Databricks cluster. Right now, the mlflow api only accepts a new cluster configuration when running a project on Databricks. We would like it to accept the `existing_cluster_id` as described in the [Databricks API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs#--request-structure-6) as well.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nUsers can more quickly run a mlflow project on an existing cluster that is already started up instead of waiting for the new cluster to be created (around 5 min), and the conda environment to be created (again a couple of minutes). \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nMore flexibility in choosing how to run a project on Databricks via the API or CLI.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nUsers of our ML platform (using mlflow & databricks) have been asking for the ability to use an existing cluster to test out their runs with a quicker feedback loop.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nIt's not especially difficult, just more time-consuming to have to wait for the cluster and conda environment to be created before being able to see if the run will start or be successful. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
