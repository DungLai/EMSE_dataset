However, I noticed that the supported serving models flavor does not contain PaddlePaddle. I could not use mlflow to serve a model trained by PaddlePaddle.\r\n\r\nI think this feature is valuable because PaddlePaddle is popular among Chinese users. https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle\r\nIt has received more than 10,000 stars. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nI don't think the current code needs to be edited. All we need to do is to add a new file named paddle.py I guess. I'm also trying to develop this feature. Can I submit a new pull request to mlflow if I successfully developed this new feature?","closed_by":{"login":"jinzhang21","id":78067366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDY3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78067366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21","html_url":"https://github.com/jinzhang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1969/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
