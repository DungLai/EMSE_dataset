This appears to break some functionality with the Conda environment created, as it is named as \"r-mlflow-1.0.0\".\r\n\r\nI tried to correct the code version manually in the Description file to \"Version: 1.0.0\" and reinstall the tar.package using devtools::install_local(\"path/to/corrected/version\").\r\n\r\nThe installation in R occurs without any errors. However, after loading the library, when trying to run any command, such as mlflow_start_run(), the following error appears:\r\n\r\n\"Error in process_initialize(self, private, command, args, stdin, stdout,  : \r\n  processx error: 'No such file or directory' at unix/processx.c:454\"\r\n\r\nTrying to reinstall the conda environment using install_mlflow() also doesn't correct the problem, probably because this version is not available on Github/CRAN:\r\n\r\n\"ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mlflow==1.0.0 (from versions: 0.0.1, 0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.3.0, 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 0.4.2, 0.5.0, 0.5.1, 0.5.2, 0.6.0, 0.7.0, 0.8.0, 0.8.1, 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.9.0.1, 0.9.1)\r\nERROR: No matching distribution found for mlflow==1.0.0\r\nError: Error 1 occurred installing packages into conda environment r-mlflow-1.0.0\"\r\n\r\nI must add that I am not too familiar with Conda, so probably this is something easy to correct.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce problem\r\nRscript -e 'install.packages(\"devtools\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")'\r\nRscript -e 'devtools::install_url(\"https://mlflow-snapshots.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/r-mlflow-1.0.0.rc0-1173-fb8a711.tar.gz\")'\r\nRscript -e 'reticulate::conda_create(\"r-mlflow-1.0.0\")'\r\nsource activate r-mlflow-1.0.0\r\npip install https://mlflow-snapshots.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mlflow-1.0.0.rc0-1173.fb8a711-py2.py3-none-any.whl\r\nRscript -e 'library(mlflow); utils::packageVersion(\"mlflow\")'","closed_by":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
