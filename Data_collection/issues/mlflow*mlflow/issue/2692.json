At one point I had manually deleted the mlruns folder. After that, wheen try to start a run again I kept getting the \r\n```\r\nRun with UUID {} is already active. To start a new run, first end the current run with mlflow.end_run(). To start a nested run, call start_run with nested=True\r\n```\r\nWhen I try to call `end_run`, it kept throwing `MLflowException` since the directory doesn't exist.\r\nI had to manually set the `_active_run_stack`:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.tracking.fluent._active_run_stack = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nA potential solution:\r\nwrap the line https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/63f1333c0436f897bcbb2de0ad65e21390f9434d/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py#L164 in a try catch?","closed_by":{"login":"juntai-zheng","id":39497939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng","html_url":"https://github.com/juntai-zheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
