We can't store the weights locally, so I came up with a solution with mlflow that downloads the weights from an experiment run in mlflow based on tags we created. I know this isn't the intented way to use mlflow, and I should be registering the model and placing this into the model registry.\r\n\r\nWhen making predictions we run the following line from the cli.\r\n\r\n`python detect.py --weights path_to_weights --source path_to_image`\r\n\r\nIn production, this application could be containerized with docker and orchestrated with kubernetes.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest the best way to register the weights.pt to mlflow and download them from mlflow?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
