Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a link to the documentation entry in question.\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nHi! I found mismatch between docs and actual code: `mlflow.pytorch.log_model()` parameter:  `code_paths` / `code_path`.\r\n\r\nFor the latest version `1.13.1` here is what I get:\r\n\r\n- [documentation says](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/1.13.1/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.log_model) it's `code_path` (a list of local filesystem paths to Python file dependencies ...): \r\n```\r\nmlflow.pyfunc.log_model(artifact_path, loader_module=None, data_path=None, code_path=None, conda_env=None, python_model=None, artifacts=None, registered_model_name=None, signature: Optional[mlflow.models.signature.ModelSignature] = None, input_example: Optional[Union[pandas.core.frame.DataFrame, numpy.ndarray, dict, list]] = None, await_registration_for=300)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `help(mlflow.pytorch.log_model)` says it's `code_paths` (and it actually is):\r\n```\r\nlog_model(pytorch_model, artifact_path, conda_env=None, code_paths=None, pickle_module=None, registered_model_name=None, signature: mlflow.models.signature.ModelSignature = None, input_example: Union[pandas.core.frame.DataFrame, numpy.ndarray, dict, list] = None, await_registration_for=300, requirements_file=None, extra_files=None, **kwargs)```","closed_by":{"login":"atemate","id":7501517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDE1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7501517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate","html_url":"https://github.com/atemate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atemate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
