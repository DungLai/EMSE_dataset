Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: mac os catalina 10.15.7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow.sklearn.log_model\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nmlflow.*.log_model returns None.\r\n\r\nIn the document, Version information should be returned, but None.\r\nThe description of the above function in the [document](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#adding-an-mlflow-model-to-the-model-registry) is as follows.\r\n\r\n>If a registered model with the name doesnâ€™t exist, the method registers a new model, creates Version 1, and returns a ModelVersion MLflow object. If a registered model with the name exists already, the method creates a new model version and returns the version object.\r\n\r\nexpect: mlflow.sklearn.log_model returns VersionInfo.\r\nactual: mlflow.sklearn.log_model returns None.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sklearn, version information is not returned from various model_flavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(\r\n        sk_model=sk_learn_rfr,\r\n        artifact_path=\"sklearn-model\",\r\n        registered_model_name=\"sk-learn-random-forest-reg-model\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nThe return implementation of mlflow.sklearn.log_model is shown below.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19466114/104353790-a4c1bb00-554b-11eb-8597-807f957ae129.png)\r\n\r\nbut Model.log doesn't return anything.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19466114/104353939-d20e6900-554b-11eb-88af-7fbb885ceeb6.png)\r\n\r\nI think we should add a return statement to Model.log and each model_flavor.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19466114/104354127-169a0480-554c-11eb-9118-1d56c12fdeff.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3968/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
