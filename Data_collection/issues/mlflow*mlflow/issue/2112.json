It makes our experiments totally messy. \r\nI would like create more experiments with less runs in order to have a better organization in my server. But I want to be able to compare them.\r\nWe love tags. That would be great to compare all runs with a given tag cross experiments.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nProbably nothing... Today if I call `<my_mlflow_server_url>/#/compare-runs?runs=[...]` with runs from different experiments ... it works! \r\nI am wondering why there is a constraint on the experiment id. Is it possible to remove it ? It will enable to create runs views between different experiments. For example, a view that lists all the runs launched by a user. (For example, what are my 20 latest runs ?)
