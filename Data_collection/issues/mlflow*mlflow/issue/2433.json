This would perform the inverse operation of `mlflow.set_experiment`.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice if a context manager was provided to automate the unsetting, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nwith mlflow.experiment_context('my-exp'):  # or some better name...\r\n    with mlflow.start_run('my-run'):\r\n        # log to run my-run in experiment my-exp\r\n        mlflow.log_metric('awesomeness', 100)\r\nwith mlflow.start_run('my-other-run'):\r\n    # log to run my-other-run in the default experiment\r\n    mlflow.log_param('global_state_usage', 'minimal')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nTo achieve this behavior right now, I'm doing some variation on\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.set_experiment('my-exp')\r\nwith mlflow.start_run('my-run'):\r\n    mlflow.log_metric('awesomeness', 20)\r\nmlflow.set_experiment('Default')\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is clunky and error prone.\r\n\r\nMy current workflow involves the same python interpreter session running multiple, different experiments, but logging some results to the default experiment so it acts as a kind of landing page for higher ups who want to see top level results instead of the details. \r\n\r\n(Specifically, the experiments define a set of runs of param grid searches, and the best run is reported to the default experiment.)\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nAdd a function `mlflow.unset_experiment()` which takes no inputs and does the inverse operation of `mlflow.set_experiment()`.\r\n\r\nAlso, possibly add a context manager to automatically handle the unsetting (which would have the same parameters as `mlflow.set_experiment()`).","closed_by":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2433/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
