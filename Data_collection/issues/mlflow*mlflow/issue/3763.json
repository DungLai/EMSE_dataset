Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n- [x] Maybe. I would be willing to try to contribute this feature, but I wouldn't know where to start.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nWhen comparing runs, the parameters that _differ_ from one run to another, are far more important than all the parameters that are the same for all runs in the comparison. \r\n\r\nRight now, in the comparison ui, the rows with these changing parameters are easily identified, because they're highlighted in orange. This is great, but it would be even better if all other rows could be hidden (by default, or after a single click). Similarly, for the Parallel Coordinates Plot, it would be great if only these features would be selected by default, because the ones that do not change from run to run, merely make the chart unreadable.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nWith my workflow I tend to track just about anything that is trackable. However, when doing experiments, I tend to be focused on only a small subset of these parameters. This means that when I'm comparing runs, most of the parameters are not changed between the runs, but they do completely clutter the ui/chart.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nGenerally speaking, when doing comparisons, that which is _different_ is of interest. There is also no reason to have the unchanged parameters in the Parallel Coordinates Plot at all.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nGives a better overview, and saves lots of time\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nComparing runs in the table now requires lots of scrolling to find the few relevant rows, and lots of manual deselecting irrelevant parameters for the chart.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3763/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
