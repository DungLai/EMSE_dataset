Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS 10.15.7 \r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:  mlflow models serve -m runs:/cf028fedbe554a1b82f8a634dba26abb/model\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nAfter successfully running example sklearn_logistic_regression, I attempted to serve one of the runs using the command specified in your Quickstart section: mlflow models serve -m runs:/<RUN_ID>/model from the sklearn_logistic_regression folder. See above for the actual command. When I attempt to serve the model, which I have done several times with different runs, I am sent to your GitHub page where \"Something Went Wrong\" is displayed, with instructions to create an issue.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nFollow instructions from Quickstart/Saving and Serving Models\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\r\n\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport mlflow.sklearn\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    X = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]).reshape(-1, 1)\r\n    y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0])\r\n    lr = LogisticRegression()\r\n    lr.fit(X, y)\r\n    score = lr.score(X, y)\r\n    print(\"Score: %s\" % score)\r\n    mlflow.log_metric(\"score\", score)\r\n    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(lr, \"model\")\r\n    print(\"Model saved in run %s\" % mlflow.active_run().info.run_uuid)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3951/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3951/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
