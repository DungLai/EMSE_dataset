One potentially non-obvious dependency is the Python version I use (in particular, 2 vs 3), especially pertinent since the default pickling version changed such that pickled objects in python3 are not readable by python2.\r\n\r\nWe should strive to help users remember to specify their python version, potentially by printing a warning if they provide a conda env that specifies no python version. The only problem with this particular proposal is if we later leverage the conda environment for other languages (e.g., R), although if we use [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate), then we may anyway need Python.\r\n\r\nAs an example, not remembering to include the Python version in our [tutorial example](https://github.com/databricks/mlflow/pull/96/files) made it difficult for @tomasatdatabricks and I to collaborate, as he had miniconda3 installed and I had miniconda2 installed, which only showed up at model deploy time.","closed_by":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/99/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
