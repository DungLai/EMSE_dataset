Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ x ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: no\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.4\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\nserver started from $DIR, which is /home/meunier/MLFLOW, by command\r\n`mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3030 --backend-store-uri sqlite:///$DIR/data_NMT/server.db --serve-artifacts --artifacts-destination ./data_NMT --gunicorn-opts \"--timeout 240\"`\r\n(I have also tried to give absolute path for --artifacts-destination)\r\nclient-side test:\r\n`MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://myhost:3030 python mlflow_artifacts/example.py\r\n`\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI'm getting an error:\r\n`OSError: [Errno 45] Operation not supported: '/home/meunier'`\r\nbut this path refers to the server-side file system.\r\nIt seems like if the client still trie to copy the artifact to the server area, despite the --serve-artifacts\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nrun a server by:\r\n`mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3030 --backend-store-uri sqlite:///$DIR/data_NMT/server.db --serve-artifacts --artifacts-destination ./data_NMT --gunicorn-opts \"--timeout 240\"`\r\nrun the  `mlflow_artifacts/example.py`  example **from a machine which cannot access the server disks**.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nMLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://my_server_host:3030 python mlflow_artifacts/example.py\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mlflow_artifacts/example.py\", line 42, in
