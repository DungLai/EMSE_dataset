This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.\r\n\r\nWe recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.\r\n\r\npypi-publisher 0.0.4 requires gitpython==0.3.6, but you'll have gitpython 3.1.9 which is incompatible.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
