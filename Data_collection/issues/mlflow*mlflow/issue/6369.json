I started a spark session within the notebook. However, the ingest step continues to fail due to not being able to get an active spark session.\r\n\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nDownload and setup the example MLP regression repo.\r\n\r\nUse spark to read the sample parquet file and write it to a single delta file at `\"./data/sample_table.delta\"`.
