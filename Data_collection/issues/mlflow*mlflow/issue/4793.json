Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this documentation issue template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages documentation fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nScenario 4 has a syntax error that can cause many issues with Artifact logging. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27409084/133038582-2b66ca28-8d62-4387-934f-b3520971d0c7.png)\r\n\r\nthe `--default-artifact-root` value should start with `s3://...` instead of `S3:/...` . The documentation for scenario 3 and scenario 4 would heavily benefit from example commands that the user can modify rather than having the command written in the image.\r\n\r\nAn example that can be added to the doc would be:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n mlflow server \\\r\n--backend-store-uri mysql+pymysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@mysql_db:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE} \\\r\n--default-artifact-root s3://<bucket-name> \\\r\n--host 0.0.0.0\r\n``` \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
