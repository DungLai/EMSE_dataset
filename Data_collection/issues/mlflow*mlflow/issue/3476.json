The metrics are stored and work very well. However, it's not clear how to set up the remote artifact store using NFS. The documentation states that the paths must be identical on the client and the server, but I'm not sure how this can be done in Windows - everything has backspaces or has drive letters in the path. Can this be done right now?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
