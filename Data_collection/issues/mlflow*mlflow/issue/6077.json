We’ve identified this feature as a highly requested addition to the MLflow package based on community feedback. \r\nWe're seeking a community contribution for the implementation of this feature and will enthusiastically support the development and review of a submitted PR for this.\r\n\r\n## Contribution Note\r\n\r\nAs with other roadmap items, there may be a desire for multiple contributors to work on an issue. While we don’t discourage collaboration, we strongly encourage that a primary contributor is assigned to roadmap issues to simplify the merging process. \r\nThe items on the roadmap are of a high priority. Due to the wide-spread demand of roadmap features, we encourage potential contributors to only agree to take on the work of creating a PR, making changes, and ensuring that test coverage is adequately created for the feature if they are willing and able to see the implementation through to a merged state. \r\n\r\n## Feature scope\r\n\r\nThis roadmap feature’s complexity is classified as:\r\n\r\n- [ ] `good-first-issue`: This feature is limited in complexity and effort required to implement.\r\n- [ ] `simple`: This feature does not require a large amount of effort to implement and / or is clear enough to not need a design discussion with maintainers.\r\n- [ ] `involved`: This feature will require a substantial amount of development effort but does not require an agreed-upon design from the maintainers. The feedback given during the PR phase may be involved and necessitate multiple iterations before approval. (Please bear with us as we collaborate with you to make a great contribution)\r\n- [X] `design-recommended`: This is a substantial feature that should have a design document approved prior to working on an implementation (to save your time, not ours). After agreeing to work on this feature, a maintainer will be assigned to support you throughout the development process.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIn order to support larger scale deployments of MLflow, we would like to begin to design and implement support for using popular NoSQL engines as the tracking server backend.\r\nThis FR is a first step in a potentially larger design for the 2.0 release in which support for artifact co-location with tracking server data (metrics, tags, parameters) in a single NoSQL table entry *may be* considered. The first step in realizing this potential backend scalability improvement is building the interface to NoSQL engines. \r\n\r\nFor this FR, support for using <either> CosmosDB or DynamoDB as the backing layer for the tracking server may be considered (supporting Azure or AWS), which will create a template for other NoSQL implementations. \r\n\r\nIf possible, utilization of the existing SQLAlchemy ORM is highly preferred, but if incorporating that tooling into the NoSQL interface proves too complex, utilizing standard interface SDK libraries for the chosen engine is ok. \r\n\r\nNote: This implementation will likely be relatively involved and time-consuming to implement. As such, an RFC and a design review by maintainers is required for this implementation.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature? \r\n  Scalability of the MLflow tracking server to support extremely large-scale usage patterns for users that are currently restricted on tracking server metrics, parameters, tags, and run counts.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? \r\n  Several users have brought this issue up and the required workarounds for not overwhelming the backing DB (writing bulk metrics and parameters as artifacts to avoid RDBMS limitations in table size).\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? ^\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [X] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [X] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [X] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
