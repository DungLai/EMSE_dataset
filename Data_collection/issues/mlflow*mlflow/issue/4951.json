Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful to have `dotenv` file support to specify environment variables (e.g. tracking uri) in a project-specific way so that it can be shared across teams. MLFlow could read the local dotenv file and set its tracking/artifact uri (both the command line and the library)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nThe tracking URI can be committed into version control and be will be ready-to-go when the repo is cloned. It also makes mlflow easier to use by implicitly transferring the responsibility of setting the tracking/artifact uri to the library itself. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nSetting tracking/artifact uri is an infrastructural concern which can be off-loaded to a dedicated file that is read implicitly. It will make running mlflow for new users even simpler since they can focus on the ml code and not the infrastructure. Additionally, setting environment variables is not simple for new users, especially across platforms (windows for example requires a multi-step process unless using powershell and `$Env:...`). \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nMakes it simpler to get started with mlflow, can share code templates across projects without worrying about setting the tracking/artifact uri.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nThis is more of a convenience feature, the current mlflow features and components are sufficient however this feature would further help move the focus from experiment management to the experiment itself. Especially for newer users in a project who just want to get something running.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [x] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [x] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [x] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThis feature should be quite simple to implement given the abundance of `dotenv` loader libraries across most language ecosystems. The file should be loaded when mlflow initialises and reads environment variables.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4951/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
