In my use-case, promising experiments get selected for further testing. This evaluation stage can involve anything from simply running another script after completion, using proprietary software, and to doing extensive studies with human subjects. So even though the original experiment (by mlflow definition) was completed months ago, I would like to be able to add metrics and artefacts. Also, from experience, I know that I continuously find new hyper parameters worth tuning (even though I didn’t think so the first time around), and then it’s nice to add the default value to older experiments, so that they can be compared to newer experiments where that parameter has changed. \r\n\r\nNow I’ve noticed I can just place parameters, artefacts and metrics in their respective folders, and then the website shows them just fine  However, it’d be nice to have official support for this feature, so that I can rely upon it not to break sometime in the future. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
