Then run `mlflow run ...`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nOnly tested on macos. Running first `mlflow ui` without any `mlrun` folder in the current directory generates a default `meta.yml` in `./mlrun/0/meta.yaml` which has `artifact_location: ./mlruns/0`. This leads to an issue with `mlflow.sklearn.log_model(lr, \"model\")` when run through the `mlflow run` command. It does not materialize the model in the `artifacts` folder. Note that when running the program using python instead of `mlflow run` the model does get saved. Therefore the issue only happens when using `mlflow run`.\r\nAlso note that manually changing the `artifact_location` in `./mlrun/0/meta.yaml` to the absolute path, for example `file:///path/to/currentfolder/mlruns/0` resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. run `mlflow ui` in a directory which does not have an `mlrun` folder.\r\n2. Using for example `sklearn_elasticnet_wine` of this repo, the run `mlflow run ./examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.42`\r\n3. `./mlrun/0/<id>/artifacts/` should be empty.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1898/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
