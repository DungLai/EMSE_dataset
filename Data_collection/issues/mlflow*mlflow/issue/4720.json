Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCurrent API for SearchRuns return a lot of data - including RunInfo and RunData. This can cause serious slowdown to the UI. If this is used to populate list of experiments\r\non the UI (compact version), however, only a small subset, only some basic info is needed. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? - Speed up UI\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? - Faster Experience, Less data usage\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? - Local MLFLOW server can be made speedier and data usage efficient in terms of traffic\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) - With the current search API we are forced to use the full version.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [x ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe searchRuns API -\r\n```js\r\nstatic searchRuns({ data, success, error }) {\r\n    return $.ajax(Utils.getAjaxUrl('ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/runs/search'), {\r\n      type: 'POST',\r\n      contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',\r\n      dataType: 'json',\r\n      data: JSON.stringify(data),\r\n      jsonp: false,\r\n      success: success,\r\n      error: error,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturns a very large amount of data, including runInfo, and runData (that contains params and metrics). Even if we want to load just top 100, this ends up taking a lot of traffic and slows down the UI considerably. \r\n\r\nIf one wants to load only basic information about runs in the main experiment page (only a few tags like run name, etc.), the full search results are not needed. If there was a minimal search API, or if the current search API had control for what should be returned, the loading of search results can be very optimized.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
