In the UI both runs are displayed with the same (i.e. the most recent) commit hash. This gives the impression that both experiments where run with exactly the same code, which is not true. As far as I could find, there seems to be no way to identify the \"dirty\" second run. Please let me know if I missed something.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n\r\nOther tools such as omniboard for sacred or neptune show a flag that identifies the \"dirty\" run as such. This does not make the run reproducible, but it does at least alert the user that this is the case.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1912/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
