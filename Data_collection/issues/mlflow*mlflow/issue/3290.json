Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Mac OS 10.15.6 with Homebrew 2.4.12\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip3.8 (binary)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.10.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run --no-conda sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.5\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nProblem 1: I didn't find a way to configure the Python interpreter for MLFlow, and it defaults to the \"python\" command which calls the Mac OS's Python 2 interpreter, rather than 3.8.3 installed with homebrew.\r\n\r\nProblem 2: After aliasing python as python3, the command still breaks with error:\r\nImportError: No module named pandas\r\nI have pandas installed in the global pip3 repo so this is very weird. I tried running other examples but getting similar errors for ImportError. Somehow MLFlow is not detecting my installed packages.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
