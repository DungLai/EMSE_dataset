I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### MLflow version\r\n\r\n1.26.1\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.12\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**: Not Applicable\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nThere is inconsistency when it comes to the matplotlib dependency for the autologgers. \r\n\r\nIf matplotlib is not present (common in case of running through a VM on the cloud or especially in Docker); the xgboost autologger signals the lack of matplotlib and continues with out. While the sklearn autologger crashes ungracefully.\r\n\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog()\r\n\r\n...\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    lr = LinearRegression()\r\n    lr.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nFor Sklearn:\r\n```\r\nEncountered unexpected error during sklearn autologging: No module named 'matplotlib'\r\n```\r\nFor XGboost:\r\n```\r\nERROR mlflow.xgboost: Failed to log feature importance plot. XGBoost autologging will ignore the failure and continue.
