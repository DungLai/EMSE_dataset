Currently, we might recommend that people establish a pip dependency in their conda environment to include mlflow. This comes with a few pitfalls:\r\n\r\n  - There is no connection between the `mlflow run` version and the version of `mlflow` in the conda environment. This discrepancy might cause certain API incompatibility (for example if the wrapper script starts or does not start a run, as discussed in #82). Additionally, I may update mlflow but forget to update the conda environment files of all projects.\r\n  - Our mlflow caching mechanism does not work if I have a pip dependency without a version. If the version is updated on pypi, our cache is invalid, but I would have to manually delete the `mlflow-$sha` conda environment in order to invalidate it.\r\n\r\nWe want users to be able to easily upgrade mlflow and not run into compatibility problems, so I would recommend that we automatically inject the mlflow version of the outer script into the conda environment, if it's not present (or if it's present without a version).","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
