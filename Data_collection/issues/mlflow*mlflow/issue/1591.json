In the first step, I extract features from my data, and this varies depending on which dataset (and which version) I choose, and of course the parameters for the feature extraction algorithms. I generate a feature file, which I then use for many different classification runs (again with many parameters obviously). These two steps are therefore independent from each other and completely separately executed. \r\n\r\n**Possible existing solutions**\r\n\r\n- Stuff the feature extraction parameters into the classification run (as suggested in #25). \r\nThis would require storing them in the first step somewhere near to the feature file, and then loading them during classification to insert them into mlflow. Additionally, the parameters column(s) in the dashboard would become very cluttered. It would also not be possible to store artifacts of the first step, or to add notes about which data I chose.\r\n- Create an experiment for each dataset.\r\nNo possibility to add parameters or, again, notes. Also I could not use the experiments feature as it is intended anymore.\r\n- Use nested runs.\r\nThis would make a lot of sense, but I could not find out how to choose a specific parent run, and whether it is possible to have a finished run as a parent. Maybe this would even be better than below suggested solution.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Solution**\r\n\r\nMaybe there is another better way to do it, but this seems to be the simplest to implement. I would make runs for each feature extraction, where I could add all my parameters and notes etc. Then, for classification I would specify a run id of a feature extraction run, let my code extract the feature file from that run's artifacts and do the work. In the dashboard, optimally there would be a column (like a parameter column) where each entry is a clickable link to the feature extraction run, where I can look up all the details.","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1591/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
