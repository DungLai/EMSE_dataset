I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.26.1\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 20.04)**:\r\n- **Python version**: 3.10\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nI am using mlflow with azure blob and psql. While training I can successfully logs, the PyTorch model on the Azure blob storage. However when I am trying to access the model for the inference I get error \r\n\r\n**mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: The following failures occurred while downloading one or more artifacts from wasbs://mlflow-test@mlflowsmodeltorage.blob.core.windows.net/111/353d98eb546d47ad851788d127e10a7e/artifacts: {'model': \"ResourceNotFoundError('The specified blob does not exist.\\\\nRequestId:f54d469e-801e-0038-102c-8f4ee4000000\\\\nTime:2022-07-03T22:30:50.4136595Z\\\\nErrorCode:BlobNotFound')\"}**\r\n\r\nHowever, I can see the blob on the azure blob storage. What I found is that It is giving an error this for the folder, even when I try to access using azure storage python SDK. But if I set the final path with files such as conda.yaml or whatever, I can download the file but not the root folder. \n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://20.28.195.42/mlflow/\")\r\nmlflow.set_registry_uri(\"http://20.28.195.42/mlflow/\")\r\nself.model_path = f\"runs:/{os.environ['RUN_ID']}/model\"\r\nself.model = mlflow.pytorch.load_model(self.model_path)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
