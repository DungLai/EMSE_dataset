For now I can embed this into my model class and handle preprocessing through my own code. \r\n\r\nIn my case, this means adding a new `predict` function to my model class, which accepts a URL parameter, reads the file, converts the file to features (3D numpy data), packs this into a Tensor, and finally calls the native `forward` method of pytorch.\r\n\r\nB) Export function via `mlflow.pyfunc.load_pyfunc`\r\n\r\nThis function seems to be unusable for my use-case. The model requires a dataframe as input, but I cannot easily embed a 3D or 4D tensor as a dataframe. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to use URLs as inputs, and embed pre-processing logic as indicated above. However, I cannot find a recommended way of handling this type of issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a suitable work-around using native pytorch, but it seems pyfunc integration is not adaptable for this use-case. \r\n\r\nAre there any recommended methods to overcome this type of issue? Do you have any plans to further streamline model packaging with easily configurable pre-processing steps?","closed_by":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/702/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
