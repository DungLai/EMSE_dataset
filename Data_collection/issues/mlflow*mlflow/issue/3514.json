Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nour team is working on combining the mlflow framework with the xgboost model. Previously, I use single-instance xgboost model to train, which works fine with mlflow to log all the model-related parameters by using \" mlflow.xgboost.autolog() \", but when i change to distributed xgboost version changing from python package to JVM package by including the xgboost4j.jar and xgboost4j-spark.jar files, and also include mlflow module into it, (“mlflow.xgboost.autolog()”). The mlflow cannot show all the parameters on the page. They are empty. enter image description here\r\n\r\nSo I looked at the source code in the mlflow.xgboost, in line 271, “def autolog(importance_types=[“weight”]):” says it imports the xgboost package, which i think is the single-instance xgboost model, I wonder if it is support the distributed version? Or is there any other methods to solve the problem? Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56243512/95747529-327ed780-0ccb-11eb-8c71-b61443fe46dd.png)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\ndef autolog(importance_types=[\"weight\"]):\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
