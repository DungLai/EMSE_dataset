Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a `mlflow.gensim` module for gensim models. [Here is documentation of a gensim tfidf model.](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/tfidfmodel.html)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n   Save, load and use gensim models such as tfidf as a built-in flavor\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n  gensim models are widely used by the NLP community, not being able to use mlflow for those models is a shame \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n  We are thinking about moving models to mlflow, but we cannot do it if mlflow does not support gensim.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n## Which MLflow component(s) does this feature affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] UI\r\n- [ ] Command Line Interface\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [x] Examples\r\n- [x] Docs\r\n- [ ] Tracking\r\n- [ ] Projects\r\n- [ ] Artifacts\r\n- [x] Models\r\n- [ ] Model Registry\r\n- [ ] Scoring\r\n- [ ] R\r\n- [ ] Java\r\n- [ ] Python\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal\r\nfor how to implement this feature, please include it here.
