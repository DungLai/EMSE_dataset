However, the code has since been refactored and some of the dependencies called by the stored code have been moved. This causes mlflow.pytorch.load_model to fail when trying to add the stored code to the system path. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nAdd an option (such as use_code_paths) to mlflow.pytorch.load_model. I believe the only change required is to check whether check use_code_paths=True at the if statement on line 353 of mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2714/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
