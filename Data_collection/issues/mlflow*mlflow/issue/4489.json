Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10 Version 10.0.19041 Build 19041\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.18.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nAfter logging ~80 parameters to the postgres tracking database, the number of available connections is exhausted, and I get the following error:\r\n```\r\n2021/06/21 14:21:00 WARNING mlflow.store.db.utils: SQLAlchemy engine could not be created. The following exception is caught.\r\n(psycopg2.OperationalError) FATAL:  too many connections for role \"zibvebrgldjyaa\"\r\n\r\n(Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/14/e3q8)\r\nOperation will be retried in 0.1 seconds\r\n```\r\nOnly 20 connections are available because I'm using a [Heroku Free-tier postgres database](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql). I'm the only one accessing the database and using `select * from pg_stat_activity where datname = 'dbname'` I can confirm that all connections are created by mlflow.\r\n\r\n  I expected mlflow would use a constant and low number of connections. I did not see any improvement when setting `MLFLOW_SQLALCHEMYSTORE_POOL_SIZE` and `MLFLOW_SQLALCHEMYSTORE_MAX_OVERFLOW` environment variables.\r\n\r\nThe  version of the postgres database is: `PostgreSQL 13.3 (Ubuntu 13.3-1.pgdg20.04+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0, 64-bit`\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nMinimal example:\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    with mlflow.start_run(run_name='test'):\r\n        for i in range(100):\r\n            mlflow.log_param(f\"test_run_count {i}\", i)\r\n```\r\nthe same problem is encountered when logging across multiple runs.\r\n\r\nMinimal example with connection counting:\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef count_connections():\r\n    uri = os.getenv('MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI')\r\n    dbname = uri.rsplit('/', 1)[-1]\r\n    query = f\"\"\"select *\r\n                from pg_stat_activity\r\n                where datname = '{dbname}';\"\"\"\r\n    df = pd.read_sql(query, uri)\r\n    return len(df)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    with mlflow.start_run(run_name='test'):\r\n        for i in range(100):\r\n            mlflow.log_param(f\"test_run_count {i}\", i)\r\n            logging.info(f'{count_connections()} connections')\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe number of connections is slowly increasing toward the limit of 20. The increase is not monotonically increasing, after the first 10 parameters the number of active connections is: 6,8,6,8,9,10,7,9,10,11\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
