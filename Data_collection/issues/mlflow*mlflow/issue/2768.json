Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nAllow Tracking server to plot metrics across runs with timestamp as the x-axis.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nWe use tracking server to log model artifacts, job metrics & metadata. Job metadata is logged in tags section. However, if we re-run the job and log information to a new run, tracking server does not allow the users to plot the metrics across multiple runs. This change will allow users to log metrics, and job metadata to a new run.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nIt extends the functionality of tracking server.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nWe have automated workflows that run at a schedule. We want to save automated workflow information as a new run but also want the ability to see the metrics trends over time.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nTracking server cannot plot metrics across runs.\r\n\r\n## Which MLflow component(s) does this feature affect?\r\n\r\n- [x] UI\r\n- [ ] Command Line Interface\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Examples\r\n- [ ] Docs\r\n- [x] Tracking\r\n- [ ] Projects\r\n- [ ] Artifacts\r\n- [ ] Models\r\n- [ ] Model Registry\r\n- [ ] Scoring\r\n- [ ] R\r\n- [ ] Java\r\n- [ ] Python\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tanmaymathur89","id":2205288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDUyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2205288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89","html_url":"https://github.com/tanmaymathur89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanmaymathur89/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2768/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2768/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
