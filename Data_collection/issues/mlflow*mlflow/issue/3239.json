Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\n[Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#concepts) could be extended by a list.\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nHey,\r\ni am fairly new to mlflow and was just wondering which file types are supported by mlflow artifacts viewer.\r\nI could only find [examples](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#concepts) in the documentation not a full list. (if I missed something please send me a link)\r\n\r\nI would suggest a short list of file types & file endings.\r\n\r\n- picture: .jpg, .png, ...\r\n- gif: .gif\r\n- pdf: .pdf\r\n- text: .txt, ...\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nExamples (pictures) would be awesome, but a list would be a good first step!\r\n\r\nThe list would make it easier for everyone to get a grasp of what mlflow artifact viewer is capable of visualizing.\r\n\r\nPS: I saw a [map visualizer component](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/artifact-view-components/ShowArtifactMapView.js), but have no clue what artifact file format is expected and what the outcome would look like.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
