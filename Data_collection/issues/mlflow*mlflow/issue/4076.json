There should be a way to specify to mlflow a particular AWS profile or set of keys.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nI'd like to separate the different access with a different set of keys in my program\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThere should be an option for this since it's what most program with AWS support does\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nWe should have something that accepts env vars such as  \r\n `MLFLOW_AWS_PROFILE` or `MLFLOW_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`MLFLOW_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or a way to specify a set of keys for the tracking server that is specific to MLFlow.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4076/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4076/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
