As organizations and projects scale and an increasing number of ML runs are logged, users have a need to severely limit the search results returned. In addition to selecting specific rows, there may be needs to limit the number of parameters, metrics, tags, and run attributes returned with searches.  In cases where a large number of runs are produced from a search, there is a need to paginate the results at server-side and return only a limited set of runs at a time.\r\n\r\nIn this RFC, we present proposals to extend search functionality for advanced use cases along with some optimizations. We also discuss proposed solution for server-side pagination of results.\r\n\r\n### Components\r\n\r\n1.
