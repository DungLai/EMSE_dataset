Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: not sure, it's a Spark Cluster\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: latest\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI'm not very familiar with parallelization in Python and I'm getting an error when trying to train a model on multiple training folds in parallel. Here's a simplified version of my code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef train_test_model(fold):\r\n    # here I train the model etc...\r\n    \r\n    # now I want to save the parameters and metrics\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.log_param(\"run_name\", run_name)\r\n        mlflow.log_param(\"modeltype\", modeltype)\r\n        # and so on...\r\n\r\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\r\n    pool = ThreadPool(processes = num_trials)\r\n    # run folds in parallel\r\n    pool.map(lambda fold:train_test_model(fold), folds)\r\n```\r\nI'm getting the following error:\r\n\r\n`Exception: Run with UUID 23e9bb6d22674a518e48af9c51252860 is already active. To start a new run, first end the current run with mlflow.end_run(). To start a nested run, call start_run with nested=True`\r\n\r\nThe documentation says that mlflow.start_run() starts a new run and makes it active which is the root of my problem. Every thread starts a MLFlow run for its corresponding fold and makes it active while I need the runs to run in parallel i.e. all be active(?) and save parameters/metrics of the corresponding fold. How can I solve that issue?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"blazejdolicki","id":29718307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzE4MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29718307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki","html_url":"https://github.com/blazejdolicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazejdolicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3592/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
