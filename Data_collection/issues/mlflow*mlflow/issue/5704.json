Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS Linux 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n```\r\n# this gives an expected error RestException: RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(\"Default\")\r\n# this gives an unexpected error and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(\"Default\", artifact_location=\"local\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mlflow.create_experiment(\"HelloWorld\", artifact_location=\"local\")` where HelloWorld is an experiment that already exists, instead of getting the expected error `RestException: RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS`, the request hangs for over 60 seconds effectively making the server go unresponsive, and finally returns the error: \r\n```\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/create failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/create (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not happen without artifact_location argument. \r\n\r\nServer Error: \r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/mlplats-mlflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 2073, in wsgi_app\r\n    response = self.full_dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/mlplats-mlflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1518, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.handle_user_exception(e)\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/mlplats-mlflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1516, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/mlplats-mlflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1502, in dispatch_request\r\n    return self.ensure_sync(self.view_functions[rule.endpoint])(**req.view_args)\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/mlplats-mlflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mlflow/server/handlers.py\", line 241, in wrapper\r\n    response.set_data(e.serialize_as_json())\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/mlplats-mlflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mlflow/exceptions.py\", line 60, in serialize_as_json\r\n    return json.dumps(exception_dict)\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/3.9.5/lib/python3.9/json/__init__.py\", line 231, in dumps\r\n    return _default_encoder.encode(obj)\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/3.9.5/lib/python3.9/json/encoder.py\", line 199, in encode\r\n    chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True)\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/3.9.5/lib/python3.9/json/encoder.py\", line 257, in iterencode\r\n    return _iterencode(o, 0)\r\n  File \"/pyenv/versions/3.9.5/lib/python3.9/json/encoder.py\", line 179, in default\r\n    raise TypeError(f'Object of type {o.__class__.__name__} '\r\nTypeError: Object of type IntegrityError is not JSON serializable\r\n```\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is optional -->\r\n\r\nFor bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"MLflow version:\", mlflow.__version__)\r\nprint(\"Tracking URI:\", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nprint(\"Artifact URI:\", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: http://localhost:5000/\r\nArtifact URI: local-artifacts/0/68e0c4bee1a14515b03884c56e221f9b/artifacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mydb.sqlite --default-artifact-root=local-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n```\r\n# this works\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(\"HelloWorld\", artifact_location=\"local\")\r\n# this breaks and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(\"HelloWorld\", artifact_location=\"local\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
