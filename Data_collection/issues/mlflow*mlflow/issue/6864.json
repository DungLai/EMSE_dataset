This feature request proposes introducing the ability to search for runs based on end time by supplying a search filter string of the form `\"attributes.end_time > 1663889102000`.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nUsers often want to filter runs by completion time, rather than start time, since some runs may not finish.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n^\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nNot currently supported by MLflow's search APIs\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThis feature can be implemented by adding the `@searchable_attribute` decorator to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/fa96efefc6f415d39038ce489aaf55217c6018af/mlflow/entities/run_info.py#L128-L130\r\n\r\nTests can be introduced to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/tests/utils/test_search_utils.py.\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
