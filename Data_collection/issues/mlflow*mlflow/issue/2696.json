Proposal: \r\nAdd ability to compare different artifacts (ie plots, pngs, txt files) of different experiment runs for a side-by-side comparison on the Comparison Dashboard. \r\n\r\n#### Motivation:\r\nAt the moment, the framework allows comparisons of parameters and metrics per run but there is no way to compare the artifacts of those runs. Some experiments require more than a line-graph to fully glance at the results. So we save those results as pngs and store them as artifacts. I am proposing to also be able to compare those artifacts the same way we compare parameters and metrics in the comparison-view. This would allow anyone to quickly glance at artifacts without having to open up different dashboard views to view the artifacts. \r\n\r\n__Example of what I envision:__\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14831613/79155504-d2988a00-7d96-11ea-8b9c-29adbb791b8c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Changes: \r\n**How achievable is this?** I believe it can be done using the rest API for listing artifacts [List Artifacts](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#list-artifacts) but have not played around with that enough. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2696/reactions","total_count":25,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":12,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
