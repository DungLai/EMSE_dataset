It will change all plugins except RunContextProviders\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nCurrently the registries load all plugin installed in current virtual environment. If one plugin fails to be loaded, the error is caught (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/tracking/context/registry.py#L33) It makes the debug of the plugin more difficult.\r\nThe suggestion is to load the plugin on demand and don't catch the error if the plugin fails to be loaded.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nRemove Registry class. Replace by loader functions that use `entrypoints`","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
