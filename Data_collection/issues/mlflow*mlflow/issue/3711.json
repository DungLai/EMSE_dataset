I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes, see the reproduction code below\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10  (&Ubuntu 18.04)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip install mlflow\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.12.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: \r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: run reproduction code\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nBecause python on Windows has a different mechanism for multiprocessing (spawn, not fork), mlflow.start_run assigns new run_id-s as many as the number of processes. This does not happen on Linux. I'd like to have the same result on Windows as on Linux. \r\n\r\nMaybe if I can assign run_id manually before `mlflow.start_run()`, it might be a workaround.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nimport random\r\n\r\ndef worker(id):\r\n    for i in range(10):\r\n        mlflow.log_metric(\"i\", i+id*100)\r\n        mlflow.log_metric(\"random\", random.random())\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    ps = [Process(target=worker, args=(idx, )) for idx in range(10)]\r\n\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.log_param(\"test\", 0)\r\n        for p in ps:\r\n            p.start()\r\n        for p in ps:\r\n            p.join()\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n   main() \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nOn Windows, \r\n```\r\nmlruns\r\n└── 0\r\n    ├── 0923090c0e8a48c1ad2806eda88eaab5\r\n    ├── 169e98c4aee045268f0c7fe69badc3f2\r\n    ├── 204b344b0f6c4f5c85614ab2708ffae5\r\n    ├── 8329fa81732f4d09a4f54bde9059e445\r\n    ├── 86d15c82cf16405aa80f855f317c659e\r\n    ├── 992bb9a789cd4abeb898941162493170\r\n    ├── 9dc6ac9fc8724e6986b53579e5caa6a4\r\n    ├── ad78ec27aec74ae9a66002cae1b9d152\r\n    ├── cdde35adc1ec46f287d6460927fb482a\r\n    ├── d7275185463447ad95d3d2caa0510d80\r\n    ├── f60e899f099c496ca35843fd5f34ea73\r\n    └── meta.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Linux\r\n```\r\nmlruns\r\n└── 0\r\n    ├── abcad6f993b54344b8c541b523a8b628\r\n    └── meta.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
