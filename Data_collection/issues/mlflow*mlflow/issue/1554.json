Is there still current work going on in this direction? Logging a model without specifying the step/epoch/iteration it was generated doesn't make a lot of sense. For our project we would like to get the best model of a run/experiment where best means:\r\nDuring the training some metrics and checkpoints/models are logged periodically (currently it all happens at the same time i.e. once per epoch). Now get the the run and timestamp when some logged metric is a global maximum/minimum (across all experiments, or all runs in one experiment). But at this point it gets hard because the models/artifacts are not mapped to the metrics (or the other way around). \r\n\r\nIs there something I'm missing out on? Is there some way how this is supposed to be done? I would say it's a crucial feature to get the best model for a run/experiment given some metric-key. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1554/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1554/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
