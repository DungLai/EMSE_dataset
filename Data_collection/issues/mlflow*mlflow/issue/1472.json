supports deploying models to SageMaker using Endpoints for real-time inference: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/sagemaker/cli.py\r\n\r\nIs there interest in adding SageMaker Batch Transform support for offline inference as well?\r\n\r\nThe usage story is: users would supply their model, an input S3 bucket and content type, an output S3 bucket and Accept type, and instance types and counts. SageMaker Batch will run a job using input S3 data and storing inferences in output S3 bucket.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1472/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
