Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nYes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### MLflow version\r\n\r\n1.27.0\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution**: Windows Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044\r\n- **Python version**: 3.10.0\r\n- **R version**: 4.1.2\r\n- **mlflow R package version**: 1.26.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI cannot load a model which I have previously logged.\r\n\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```r\r\nmod <- carrier::crate(\r\n  .fn = function(formula, data) stats::lm(formula = formula, data = data),\r\n  formula, data\r\n)\r\n\r\nmlflow::mlflow_log_model(model = mod, artifact_path = \"myCoolMod\")\r\n# 2022/07/20 14:42:35 INFO mlflow.store.artifact.cli: Logged artifact from local dir C:/.../Rtmp44ZXKk/myCoolMod to artifact_path=myCoolModRoot URI: file://C:/.../mlruns/0/bf154459eeca42a4b4f4e811ce615897/artifacts\r\n# # A tibble: 2 x 3\r\n#   path                is_dir file_size\r\n#   <chr>               <lgl>      <int>\r\n# 1 myCoolMod/MLmodel   FALSE        176\r\n# 2 myCoolMod/crate.bin FALSE        309\r\n\r\nmlflow::mlflow_load_model(\r\n  model_uri = \"file://C:/Users/EHYLM/work/mlruns/0/bf154459eeca42a4b4f4e811ce615897/artifacts/myCoolMod\",\r\n  flavor = \"crate\"\r\n)\r\n# Error in file(file, \"rt\", encoding = fileEncoding) : \r\n#   cannot open the connection\r\n# In addition: Warning message:\r\n# In file(file, \"rt\", encoding = fileEncoding) :\r\n#   cannot open file 'C:/.../mlruns/0/bf154459eeca42a4b4f4e811ce615897//MLmodel': Invalid argument\r\n```\r\n\r\nI took a look under the hood and there are a couple of things going on here. Firstly, [`mlflow:::mlflow_download_artifacts_from_uri()`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/tracking-runs.R#L427-L431) is called and returns \r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel_path\r\n# [1] \"C:\\\\...\\\\mlruns\\\\0\\\\bf154459eeca42a4b4f4e811ce615897\\\\artifacts\\\\myCoolMod\\r\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there has been a `\\r` appended here. If you step into this function, there is a `\\n` too but this is removed [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/tracking-runs.R#L427-L430). I _think_ this is a bug.\r\n\r\nIf we carry on stepping through the `mlflow::mlflow_load_model()`, the following is called ([here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model.R#L80))\r\n\r\n```r\r\nfs::path(model_path, \"MLmodel\")\r\n# /MLmodel/.../work/mlruns/0/bf154459eeca42a4b4f4e811ce615897/artifacts/myCoolMod\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, rather than appending the `MLmodel`, it has instead prepended it. This may well be a bug within the `fs` package.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [X] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
