I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nCurrently, based on the type of the model be it classification or regression, with evaluators as default, Mlflow evaluate method outputs a defined list of evaluation metrics. This feature request is to check if we could achieve a kind of filtering in the evaluation metric so the user can select which of the default metrics is required. In some case, not all metrics are required and this provides the user with more flexibility.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nUser to select the list of evaluation metrics from the list present when default evaluator is used.\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nMore flexibility\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nUser can only look at the list of metrics that are required\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
