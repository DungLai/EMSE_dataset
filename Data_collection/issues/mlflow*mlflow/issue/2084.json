Describe the proposal\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a new component for the table of runs using https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table .\r\nBenefits : \r\n* easy to sort (click on the right column)\r\n* easy to filter (write your filter on top of the column)\r\n* proper pagination\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe use case for us at Criteo is to be able to compare many runs (for example we do some hyperparameter tunings in different teams) on several metrics / parameters / tags.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nOn top of these already merged changes : \r\n* filtering in sql as implemented by @jcuquemelle in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2030\r\n* sorting and limiting in sql as implemented by @jcuquemelle in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2059\r\n\r\nI'm proposing : \r\n* a whitelisting option in search_runs to retrieve only some runs, tags, metrics : I will propose a PR for this soon\r\n=> these 3 changes make the backend fast enough (<500ms in our case)\r\n\r\nand 2 small additional changes : \r\n* return the total number of runs in search_runs : this is required to have a proper pagination in the ui : I will soon propose a PR for this\r\n* a new endpoint that retrieve the list of tags, metrics, params for an experiment : required to be able to select what columns to show in UI : I will soon propose a PR for this\r\n\r\nAll these backend changes can then be used in a new ui based on react-table.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this : \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2346494/68680214-98198f80-0561-11ea-8da1-99917dd2b5f8.png)\r\n\r\nI will also submit a PR for this change (the code is mostly ready and working, but there's a few things to finish)\r\n\r\n(cc @Zangr )\r\n\r\nThis should handle both
