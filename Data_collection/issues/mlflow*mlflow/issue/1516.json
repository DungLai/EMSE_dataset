On my own project, I have a src folder inside my repo where I put all the python code, and the Dockerfile and MLproject files are located at the root of the repo (one level above the src folder). Strange thing is, when I run the mlflow run command, it seems that all my python files within the src folder are copied directly in /mlflow/projects/code, and not in /mlflow/projects/code/src.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nI have reproduced this behavior directly in examples/docker folder. If I run the following commands:\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir examples/docker/myfolder\r\ntouch examples/docker/myfolder/myfile.txt\r\nmlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5\r\ndocker run mlflow-docker-example-<git-version> ls\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the below output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDockerfile\r\nDockerfile.mlflow-autogenerated\r\nMLproject\r\nREADME.rst\r\nkubernetes_config.json\r\nkubernetes_job_template.yaml\r\nmyfile.txt\r\ntrain.py\r\nwine-quality.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe folder myfolder disappeared, and myfile.txt is copied at root level.\r\n\r\nIs that a desired behavior?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
