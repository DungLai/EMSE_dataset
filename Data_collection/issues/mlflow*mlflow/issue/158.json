I am using MLFlow and would like to store all of my model artifacts in S3. However, when I try to execute the above command, it isn't communicating with S3. I think that it is still trying to create a local directory (in my tmp), using this name. When I do `mlflow experiments list`, I get:\r\n```\r\n  Experiment Id  Name     Artifact Location\r\n---------------  -------  -------------------------------\r\n              0  Default  /private/tmp/s3:/<my s3>/0\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, if I ran `mlflow server` in a directory where there was already an mlruns directory present, it would use that and ignore my S3 input. I have credentials setup in ~/.aws/credentials","closed_by":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
