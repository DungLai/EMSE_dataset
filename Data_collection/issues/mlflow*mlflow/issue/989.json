API response body: {\"error_code\": \"RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST\", \"message\": \"Could not find experiment with ID 0\"}`\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nOk, so the problem comes when I execute `mlflow server --file-store ./some_dir --host 0.0.0.0` and I use:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://mlflow:5000\")\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n ...\r\n```\r\nEverything works correctly. But if I do the exact same and `./some_dir` is a mounted volume in a docker-compose, it throws the error above. What I am trying to do is to store the files that should go in `./some_dir` directly in a volume that is also linked to a local minio server. \r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, `./some_dir` must be persistent, I don't know if it has something to do with my problem. Anyhow, the volume I mount is persistent across the compose and in my local file storage.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/613#issuecomment-444347119\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Full error traceback:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/opt/miniconda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py in start_run(run_uuid, experiment_id, source_name, source_version, entry_point_name, source_type, run_name, nested)\r\n    146                 entry_point_name=entry_point_name,\r\n    147                 source_type=source_type or _get_source_type(),\r\n--> 148                 parent_run_id=parent_run_id)\r\n    149     _active_run_stack.append(ActiveRun(active_run_obj))\r\n    150     return _active_run_stack[-1]\r\n\r\n/opt/miniconda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py in create_run(self, experiment_id, user_id, run_name, source_type, source_name, entry_point_name, start_time, source_version, tags, parent_run_id)\r\n     64             source_version=source_version,\r\n     65             tags=[RunTag(key, value) for (key, value) in iteritems(tags)],\r\n---> 66             parent_run_id=parent_run_id,\r\n     67         )\r\n     68 \r\n\r\n/opt/miniconda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/rest_store.py in create_run(self, experiment_id, user_id, run_name, source_type, source_name, entry_point_name, start_time, source_version, tags, parent_run_id)\r\n    148             start_time=start_time, source_version=source_version, tags=tag_protos,\r\n    149             parent_run_id=parent_run_id))\r\n--> 150         response_proto = self._call_endpoint(CreateRun, req_body)\r\n    151         run = Run.from_proto(response_proto.run)\r\n    152         if run_name:\r\n\r\n/opt/miniconda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/rest_store.py in _call_endpoint(self, api, json_body)\r\n     56         host_creds = self.get_host_creds()\r\n     57         response = http_request_safe(\r\n---> 58             host_creds=host_creds, endpoint=endpoint, method=method, json=json_body)\r\n     59         js_dict = json.loads(response.text)\r\n     60         parse_dict(js_dict=js_dict, message=response_proto)\r\n\r\n/opt/miniconda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py in http_request_safe(host_creds, endpoint, **kwargs)\r\n     71     Wrapper around ``http_request`` that also verifies that the request succeeds with code 200.\r\n     72     \"\"\"\r\n---> 73     response = http_request(host_creds=host_creds, endpoint=endpoint, **kwargs)\r\n     74     if response.status_code != 200:\r\n     75         base_msg = \"API request to endpoint %s failed with error code \" \\\r\n\r\n/opt/miniconda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py in http_request(host_creds, endpoint, retries, retry_interval, **kwargs)\r\n     56             time.sleep(retry_interval)\r\n     57     raise MlflowException(\"API request to %s failed to return code 200 after %s tries\" %\r\n---> 58                           (url, retries))\r\n     59 \r\n     60 \r\n\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://mlflow:5000/api/2.0/preview/mlflow/runs/create failed to return code 200 after 3 tries\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/989/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
