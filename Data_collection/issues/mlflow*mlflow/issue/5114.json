Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip installed\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.21.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.13\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run \"'https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git#examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine'\" --version af8460f4f5f8bd407a597e1e52e2ff77d646a3cdD\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen one submits a kubernetes job with the function mlflow.kubernetes.run_kubernetes_job, the API adds quotes to command's strings with '#', since this is the behavior of shlex.quote, called by mlflow.kubernetes._get_run_command. However, when there are quotes in the URI, the function mlflow.projects._parse_subdirectory doesn't work properly. I expected that mlflow.projects._parse_subdirectory worked the same way regardless the presence of quotes in the URI.\r\n\r\nThe following description was taken from a submitted job that didn't run properly:\r\n...\r\nContainers:\r\n  example:\r\n    Command:\r\n      mlflow\r\n      run\r\n      'https://github.com/mlflow.git#examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine'\r\n      -e\r\n      main\r\n      --run-id\r\n      2ca2d29eb2684a488a3dd64a5a3d4ec6\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nDespite its association with mlflow.kubernetes, this error can be reproduced without it. The following command ensures that the single quotes around the URI reach mlflow.projects._parse_subdirectory function:\r\n\r\nmlflow run \"'https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git#examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine'\" --version af8460f4f5f8bd407a597e1e52e2ff77d646a3cdD\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\nLog from the command to reproduce the bug:\r\nmlflow-dev-env) miniconda@8af2d3c356c3:/workspace$ mlflow run
