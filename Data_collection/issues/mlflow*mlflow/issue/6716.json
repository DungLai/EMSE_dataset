I set the repository-uri in the kubernetes-config.json file to a public repository on docker hub. When I run the mlflow run command with backend kubernetes, the process crashs becouse the access to the repository gets denied, which doesn't make sense as it is a public repository.\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n mlflow run . --backend kubernetes --backend-config kubernetes_config.json\r\n\n\n### Stack trace\n\n2022/09/06 23:35:35 INFO mlflow.projects.docker: === Building docker image user/test:04e4263 ===\r\n2022/09/06 23:35:36 INFO mlflow.projects.kubernetes: === Pushing docker image user/test:04e4263 ===\r\n2022/09/06 23:35:38 ERROR mlflow.cli: === Error while pushing to docker registry: denied: requested access to the resource is denied ===\r\n\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [X] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6716/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
