Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: mainly mlflow/examples/keras, a bit of custom code\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:  pip install\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.3.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nuse mlflow/examples/keras/train.py\r\nand append\r\n\r\n    mlflow.keras.log_model(model, \"myModel\")\r\n\r\nLater use \r\n\r\n   mlflow models serve -m PATH/TO/myModel\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen running this, i get the problem \r\nResolvePackageNotFound:\r\n   - keras==2.3.0\r\n\r\nthe problem seems that keras is a conda dependency, and not a pip dependency. The original conda.yaml file which log_model produces is as follows:\r\n\r\nchannels:\r\n     - defaults\r\n    dependencies:\r\n    - python=3.6.9\r\n    - keras==2.3.0\r\n    - tensorflow==1.14.0\r\n    - pip:\r\n      - mlflow\r\n    name: mlflow-env\r\n\r\nHowever, when I move the keras dep. into pip  \r\n\r\n    channels:\r\n    - defaults\r\n    dependencies:\r\n    - python=3.6.9\r\n    - tensorflow==1.14.0\r\n    - pip:\r\n      - keras==2.3.0\r\n      - mlflow\r\n    name: mlflow-env\r\n\r\nit works.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\ndescribed above\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback.
