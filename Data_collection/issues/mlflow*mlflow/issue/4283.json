Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThis FR proposes to provide autologging functionality to intercept TensorboardX events emitted during model training (e.g. PyTorch training) and log corresponding metrics / tags / parameters to MLflow Tracking.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Easing the incorporation of MLflow Tracking into existing training workflows that make use of the popular tensorboardX tool (including other libraries, such as https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Broadens the ecosystem of supported Tracking-compatible ML frameworks to include a variety of prominent tools.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? MLflow collaborators, including Microsoft, use tensorboardX-integrated tools.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Without tensorboardX integrations, users must currently add both MLflow & tensorboardX logging statements to their training code. For certain libraries that leverage tensorboardX (e.g. DeepSpeed), users often cannot directly control the instrumentation themselves.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nPerhaps an `mlflow.tensorboardx.autolog()` API makes sense for exposing this functionality; we'll have to work on designing / naming API(s) for this feature.\r\n\r\nWe could also consider a plugin system for autologging integrations.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
