Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Databricks\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: NA\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow.spark.log_model(spark_model=model, registered_model_name = \"test-model\", artifact_path=\"test-model\", await_registration_for=600)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nApologies if this is desired behaviour, but passing await_registration_for didn't seem to have an effect in the case above for us - the default wait of 300 seconds was always used.  Looking in to the mlflow/tracking/_model_registry/fluent.py it seems like [L69 doesn't pass this forward to client.create_model down a certain route](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/75c4bfa1c0dda546c491adfed670f8a80b9f3ccf/mlflow/tracking/_model_registry/fluent.py#L69).\r\n\r\nIf there is a case where this shouldn't be allowed it isn't called out in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nmlflow.start_run()\r\nmlflow.spark.log_model(spark_model=model, registered_model_name = \"test-model\", artifact_path=\"test-model\", await_registration_for=600)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n2021/01/12 16:43:18 INFO mlflow.tracking._model_registry.client: Waiting up to 300 seconds for model version to finish creation.
