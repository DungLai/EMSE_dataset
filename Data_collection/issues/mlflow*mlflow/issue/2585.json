That way parameters/metrics are in the same location as the artifacts (same as when working in local mode).\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nMakes sense to have the params/metrics in a SQL db to be able to query and such, but since we can also interact with them through the `mlflow ui`, it would be more convenient to allow it all to point to a single s3 location and have `mlflow server` run only against it.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nAllow for `backend-store-uri` to be an s3 location, essentially having the same as local mode but instead of a single local file path have it be s3.","closed_by":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2585/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":18,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
