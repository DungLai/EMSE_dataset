The `to_dictionary` API is subtly different from calling dict(entity) in that it recursively converts all nested entities into dictionaries as well. However it’s not clear what the use case for this is (or for calling `dict(entity)` for that matter). Our one usage of `to_dictionary` is in the [runs CLI](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/f1629c2/mlflow/runs.py#L83), where we call to_dictionary to obtain a JSON representation of a run - however, it’s also possible to obtain such a representation via Protobuf as we do in the server (although a bit more complicated).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when we deprecate the FileStore we should consider removing the `from_dictionary` API, which is only used to deserialize entities from YAML that have been loaded into python dicts in the FileStore.","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
