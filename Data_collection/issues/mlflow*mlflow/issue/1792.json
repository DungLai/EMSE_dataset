I would be happy to as well add this to the mlflow repository, if it is of interest for you.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nWe are using mlflow in a cloud setting which we are testing with terratest. For this it would come in handy to have a Go client of mlflow. I can imagine that the same applies to services written in Go and somehow handling mlflow data.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nA folder should be added containing the golang client and the `option go_package` has to be added to the `.proto` files. It would be generated from the `.proto` files using the `protoc-gen-go` project and the commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotoc -I=\"$PROTOS\" \\\r\n    --go_out=plugins=grpc,paths=source_relative:\"$GOPATH/src\" \\\r\n    \"$PROTOS\"/databricks.proto \\\r\n    \"$PROTOS\"/service.proto\r\n\r\nprotoc -I=\"$PROTOS\" \\\r\n    --go_out=plugins=grpc,paths=source_relative:\"$GOPATH/src\" \\\r\n    \"$PROTOS\"/scalapb/scalapb.proto\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich can be added to the `generate_protos.sh`. They have to be separate calls due to this issue: https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/39.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1792/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
