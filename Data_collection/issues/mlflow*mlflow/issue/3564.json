Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow codebase)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\nAdd a way to pass through Boto3 S3 Upload Extraargs to support varying requirements for storing S3 artifacts with MLFlow Sagemaker.\r\n\r\n## Sample Use Case\r\nStoring artifacts in S3 using KMS Encryption requires setting the ServerSideEncryption and SSEKMSKeyId ExtraArgs in the Boto3 S3 Client upload_file function.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Solution\r\nAdding an optional MLFLOW_S3_UPLOAD_EXTRA_ARGS environment variable. This similar to Issue #1298\r\n\r\nThis variable takes a JSON key/value object containing the Boto3 Defined Extra Args which are passed through to the Boto3 upload_file call.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
