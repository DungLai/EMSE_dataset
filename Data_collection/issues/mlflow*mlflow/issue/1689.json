The following code snippet exemplifies the issue and also contains code lines as comments that `fix` the issue. For me this issue is related to the `LocalArtifactRepository`. The `MlflowClient.download_artifacts` method should simply support downloading empty directories.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport os\r\nimport tempfile\r\n\r\nwith tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        artifacts_dir = os.path.join(tmp_dir, \"artifacts\")\r\n        empty_dir = os.path.join(artifacts_dir, \"empty_dir\")\r\n\r\n        # empty_file = os.path.join(empty_dir, \"empty.txt\")\r\n        # open(empty_file, 'a').close()\r\n\r\n        mlflow.log_artifacts(artifacts_dir, \"artifacts\")\r\n        run_id = mlflow.active_run().info.run_uuid\r\n\r\nwith tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\r\n    mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient().download_artifacts(run_id, \"artifacts\", tmp_dir)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nTraceback:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<project_home>/mlflow_bug.py\", line 18, in <module>\r\n    mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient().download_artifacts(run_id, \"artifacts\", tmp_dir)\r\n  File \"<virtualenv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 272, in download_artifacts\r\n    return artifact_repo.download_artifacts(path, dst_path)\r\n  File \"<virtualenv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/local_artifact_repo.py\", line 60, in download_artifacts\r\n    return super(LocalArtifactRepository, self).download_artifacts(artifact_path, dst_path)\r\n  File \"<virtualenv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact_repo.py\", line 113, in download_artifacts\r\n    return download_artifacts_into(artifact_path, dst_path)\r\n  File \"<virtualenv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact_repo.py\", line 91, in download_artifacts_into\r\n    download_artifacts_into(artifact_path=file_info.path, dest_dir=local_path)\r\n  File \"<virtualenv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact_repo.py\", line 93, in download_artifacts_into\r\n    self._download_file(remote_file_path=artifact_path, local_path=local_path)\r\n  File \"<virtualenv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/local_artifact_repo.py\", line 88, in _download_file\r\n    shutil.copyfile(remote_file_path, local_path)\r\n  File \"<virtualenv>/lib64/python3.7/shutil.py\", line 120, in copyfile\r\n    with open(src, 'rb') as fsrc:\r\nIsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '<project_home>/mlruns/0/efe570a205984c9e9fcf0840b469c0d4/artifacts/artifacts/empty_dir'\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
