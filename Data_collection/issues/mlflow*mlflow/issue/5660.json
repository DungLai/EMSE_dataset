Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes \r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Tested on macOS 12.1 and Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.24.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.12\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run https://github.com/rcallagh/mlflow_submodule_test.git -v 42886f166fd550ebc56925af36ff80fd92d0095b\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen trying to run mlflow on a git project containing a submodule using a commit that is not the head of the master branch I get an error \r\n\r\n```\r\n2022/04/11 14:01:46 ERROR mlflow.cli: === Unable to checkout version '42886f166fd550ebc56925af36ff80fd92d0095b' of git repo https://github.com/rcallagh/mlflow_submodule_test.git- please ensure that the version exists in the repo. Error: Cmd('git') failed due to: exit code(128)\r\n  cmdline: git checkout 42886f166fd550ebc56925af36ff80fd92d0095b\r\n  stderr: 'fatal: reference is not a tree: 42886f166fd550ebc56925af36ff80fd92d0095b' ===\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that this has something to do with the submodule being present in the repo (as discussed here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13425298/git-submodule-update-fatal-error-reference-is-not-a-tree) but I'm not sure how to fix it. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nI have created a toy example in https://github.com/rcallagh/mlflow_submodule_test which has a submodule https://github.com/rcallagh/submod_for_mlflow_test. If I run `mlflow run https://github.com/rcallagh/mlflow_submodule_test.git -v 4ed55d3d2655a710e0de3887e2166be585a66544` which is the most recent commit on the main branch the it runs successfully. If I run `mlflow run https://github.com/rcallagh/mlflow_submodule_test.git -v 42886f166fd550ebc56925af36ff80fd92d0095b` which is the previous commit, it fails with the error above.  \r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5660/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
