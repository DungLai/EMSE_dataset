Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n## Guidelines\r\n\r\nFeature requests typically go through the following lifecycle:\r\n\r\n1. Submit feature request with high-level description on GitHub issues (this is what you're doing now)\r\n2. Discuss feature request with a committer, who may ask for a more detailed design\r\n3. After discussion & agreement on feature request, start implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe the proposal\r\nThe `log_artifact` method in the mlflow tracking API currently requires artifacts to be stored in local directories. It would be useful if we could log **references** to artifacts instead of the artifacts themselves. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nArtifacts are occasionally very large files. In those scenarios, they might already exist on a cloud-based file system. It does not make sense to transfer this large file to a local machine in order to log it as an artifact because (1) the file may not fit on local disk, and (2) download times are likely to be long.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nPseudocode for logging artifacts from a GCS artifact repository using the Python SDK:\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.log_artifacts(\"gs://path/to/some/other/file/blob.txt\", \"mlflow/artifact/path\")\r\n```\r\nWe do not validate that the artifact exists or that the user has adequate auth scope. We simply store the URI so that it can be consumed by other operations such as `download_artifact`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2672/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
