Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Manjaro Linux 5.16.14-1-MANJARO\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: `pip install mlflow`\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.24.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.12\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow run mlflow/examples/pytorch/ --no-conda --storage-dir $(pwd)/mlruns --experiment-name Test-Exp`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm finding that the pytorch `mnist` example is ending with a failure, for no known reason. I'd love to get more debug output, but don't have an obvious way to do this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mlflow run mlflow/examples/pytorch/ --no-conda --storage-dir $(pwd)/mlruns --experiment-name Test-Exp\r\n2022/04/08 12:19:38 INFO mlflow.projects.utils: === Created directory [removed]/mlruns/tmprbb_ti6y for downloading remote URIs passed to arguments of type 'path' ===\r\n2022/04/08 12:19:38 INFO mlflow.projects.backend.local: === Running command 'python mnist_tensorboard_artifact.py \\\r\n  --batch-size 64 \\\r\n  --test-batch-size 1000 \\\r\n  --epochs 10 \\\r\n  --lr 0.01 \\\r\n  --momentum 0.5 \\\r\n  --enable-cuda True \\\r\n  --seed 5 \\\r\n  --log-interval 100\r\n' in run with ID 'ccdf036cada144fe9c91d48c15aa26d8' === \r\n...\r\nUploading TensorBoard events as a run artifact...\r\n...\r\nSample predictions\r\nSample 0 : Ground truth is \"3\", model prediction is \"5\"\r\nSample 1 : Ground truth is \"4\", model prediction is \"4\"\r\nSample 2 : Ground truth is \"3\", model prediction is \"3\"\r\nSample 3 : Ground truth is \"1\", model prediction is \"1\"\r\nSample 4 : Ground truth is \"2\", model prediction is \"2\"\r\n2022/04/08 12:22:12 ERROR mlflow.cli: === Run (ID 'ccdf036cada144fe9c91d48c15aa26d8') failed ===\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n`mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.sqlite  --default-artifact-root $(pwd)/mlruns --host 0.0.0.0`\r\n\r\nRunner:\r\n`mlflow run mlflow/examples/pytorch/ --no-conda --storage-dir $(pwd)/mlruns --experiment-name Test-Exp`\r\n\r\nCode at [mlflow...mnist_tensorboard_artifact.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/pytorch/mnist_tensorboard_artifact.py) gives me this error, and the Tracking UI also shows a failure. Artifacts are logging correctly once the directories are correctly pointed.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
