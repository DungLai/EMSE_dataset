We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label. Items tagged with the `needs design` label are awaiting a design sketch from an MLflow maintainer: @sunishsheth2009.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @sunishsheth2009 in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduce a \"share\" button that can be used to share a view / configuration of the MLflow experiment UI with other users. This button should generate a link that, when opened, configures the MLflow experiment UI to display the same Runs table columns, search query, and table ordering properties that were selected when the link was generated.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? There are many toggles / options for configuring the MLflow Experiment UI. For example, Runs table columns can be shown / hidden, search filters can be applied to the table, and different column orderings can be selected. Being able to share a particular UI state (\"view\") is important because it lets multiple users / colleagues easily examine and discuss the same set of runs, parameters, tags, metrics etc without requiring each user to manually configure the same UI state.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? MLflow is a collaborative tool. This feature will facilitate collaboration when evaluating training results via the MLflow UI. \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Many Databricks customers use the MLflow UI to collaboratively share training results and identify optimal models.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Multiple UI configuration steps are often required to identify a set of relevant runs and provide insights. When sharing these insights with other users, each user must manually configure the experiment UI in the same way, which is cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
