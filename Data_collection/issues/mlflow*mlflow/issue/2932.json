Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.4\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow sagemaker run-local -m path/to/model -i local_image`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDeploying a model using sagemaker in `run-local` mode gives the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow sagemaker run-local -m mlruns/1/770cc8a11975451c984ff9445d764b01/artifacts/cc-classifier/ -i testcc\r\nUsing the python_function flavor for local serving!\r\n2020/06/13 18:33:12 INFO mlflow.sagemaker: launching docker image with path /home/kiran/Documents/cc-net/mlruns/1/770cc8a11975451c984ff9445d764b01/artifacts/cc-classifier\r\n2020/06/13 18:33:12 INFO mlflow.sagemaker: executing: docker run -v /home/kiran/Documents/cc-net/mlruns/1/770cc8a11975451c984ff9445d764b01/artifacts/cc-classifier:/opt/ml/model/ -p 5000:8080 -e MLFLOW_DEPLOYMENT_FLAVOR_NAME=python_function --rm testcc serve\r\ndocker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:349: starting container process caused \"exec: \\\"serve\\\": executable file not found in $PATH\": unknown.\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould the docker image I'm using handle how to execute `serve`? Can't find in the documentation what specification the docker image should have. My Dockerfile to build the local image looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM python:3.7.4-slim\r\nRUN apt-get update && \\ \r\n    pip install azure-storage-blob==12.3.0 && \\ \r\n    pip install cloudpickle\r\nCOPY requirements.txt /tmp/\r\nRUN pip install --requirement /tmp/requirements.txt\r\n```\r\nIs there anywhere that has an end-to-end `mlflow.sagemaker` example?
