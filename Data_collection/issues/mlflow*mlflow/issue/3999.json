I set up a tracking server on a Spark EMR master node then access EMR from SageMaker notebook instance by using Livy. Since I am developing models in Scala Spark, so I am using MLflow Java API to track my experiments. \r\n\r\nOne issue I have is that I need to update the location of model after I found I saved and logged a wrong model. However, I could not find a way in the API doc how to get an existing run and update the value of an existing parameter. Is this supported by MLflow?\r\n\r\nCurrently I could only create a nested run, and create the same parameter in the nested run with updated value.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3999/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3999/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
