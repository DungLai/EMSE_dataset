Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\nhttps://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorials-and-examples/tutorial.html#conda-example\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nIn the R part of the documentation it is stated that one should use the `mlflow_snapshot` function to create a R dependencies Packrat file. Later the `mlflow_restore_snapshot` function is mentioned. Both functions don't exist anymore. They have been deliberately removed: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/1263.\r\nIt is not clear to me what the new way of managing dependencies based upon `renv` is. I cannot find any documentation about it.\r\nThe documentation should be changed to reflect the current way to manage dependencies in R in MLflow.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4525/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
