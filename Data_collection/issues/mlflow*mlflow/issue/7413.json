At some point, it was changed to relative references (like '3 hours ago').\r\nPlease change this back or allow the user to choose. It is very inconvenient trying to identify the runs like this: first, you have to count the days, and second, the farther back, the less specific the references become: there can be hundreds of runs, say, 5 days ago - and they are all '5 days ago' and thousands of runs 5 months ago and they are all just '5 months ago'\r\nThanks!\r\n<img width=\"219\" alt=\"2022-11-28 (1)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29167311/204302026-ec8c158e-64a1-4105-8ce1-5092f2684c2f.png\">\r\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nIdentifying runs\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThe point of using mlflow is to find previously logged experiment runs, also based on time\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nIt is very inconvenient trying to identify the runs like this: first, you have to count the days, and second, the farther back, the less specific the references become: there can be hundreds of runs, say, 5 days ago - and they are all '5 days ago' and thousands of runs 5 months ago and they are all just '5 months ago'\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
