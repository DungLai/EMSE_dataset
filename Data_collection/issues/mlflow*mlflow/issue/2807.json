Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix\r\nfor this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThis PR https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2718 (more precisely this commit https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2718/commits/9a8090ac06b815bba787909756019b75482b4208) replaced `<a>` tags used as a clickable icon with ant design's `<Button>` component. This replacement added unnecessary margins around the icons.\r\n\r\n### Before:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"303\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-10 at 23 49 59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17039389/81502451-05438d00-9319-11ea-9dbb-c74d2c085429.png\">\r\n\r\n### After:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"303\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-10 at 23 49 30\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17039389/81502462-1ab8b700-9319-11ea-89bd-9f8d0cc5dc1e.png\">\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
