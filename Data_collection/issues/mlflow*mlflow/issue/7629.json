I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nall runs under one experiment are listed in root directory, by default. It is hard to scan runs in ui, if there exist to many runs.\r\n\r\nWe can add child run under parent run by `nested run`, but two many contents under parent run may be inconvenient.\r\n\r\nHope more convenient subdirectory for runs under experiment.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nmultiple subdirectories under parent runs.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nmore convenient to create child run by python sdk, easier to scan child runs in ui.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\neasy to create and scan child runs.\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nYou should achieve another way to store tracking info by hierarchical structure.\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7629/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
