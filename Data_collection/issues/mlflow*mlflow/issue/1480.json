Now trying to infer like below -       \r\n        \r\n`curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type:application/json; format=pandas-split\" --data '{\"columns\":[\"u\", \"i\",  \"j\",  \"sl\",  \"hist_i\"], \"data\":[[2, 234, 345, 2, [1234, 2345]]]}' http://127.0.0.1:1234/invocations`       \r\nwhere last `hist_i` input takes 2D array in original model. \r\n\r\nBut MLFlow reads this inputs and converts it into a pandas dataframe where each column is an input. So here, one of the column would have numpy arrays/list as its elements. And when you send this to TF for prediction here https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/fcb6fa8d18c3f8981806f220f65c3888f99a8046/mlflow/tensorflow.py#L330 you convert the column using pandas `df[tensor_column_name].values` which gives back a 1D numpy array and inside which there are again 1D numpy arrays/list and this fails the TF prediction as it was expecting a 2D array. \r\n\r\nInstead of pandas `df[tensor_column_name].values` you should be using `np.vstack(df[tensor_column_name].values)` which will give back 2D array. \r\n\r\nDoes MLFlow supports multi-dimensional input? If yes, then how can I pass it?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
