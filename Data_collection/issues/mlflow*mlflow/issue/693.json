I've run into a bug when trying to serve an R model. I created and saved an R model by running the `examples/r_wine` script. I then serve the model by running\r\n```\r\nmlflow rfunc serve -m mlruns/0/8d5350192e7e4c46bfb73445954374bb/artifacts/model\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis all works, but I get an error when I try to hit the endpoint.\r\n\r\nWhen I try this command\r\n```\r\ncurl -d '[{\"fixed acidity\": 7, \"volatile acidity\":0.27, \"citric acid\":0.36, \"residual sugar\": 20.7, \"chlorides\": 0.045, \"free sulfur dioxide\":45, \"total sulfur dioxide\":170,\"density\":1.001,\"pH\":3,\"sulphates\":0.45,\"alcohol\":8.8}]' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST localhost:5000/invocations\r\n```\r\nI get the following error:\r\n```\r\nInvalid Request.  argument 'x' must be a raw vector\r\n```\r\nI've looked into the `model-serve.R` file and located the following block\r\n```\r\nserve_prediction <- function(json_raw, model) {\r\n  mlflow_verbose_message(\"Serving prediction: \", json_raw)\r\n\r\n  df <- data.frame()\r\n  if (length(json_raw) > 0) {\r\n    df <- jsonlite::fromJSON(\r\n      rawToChar(json_raw),\r\n      simplifyDataFrame = FALSE,\r\n      simplifyMatrix = FALSE\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  df <- as.data.frame(df)\r\n\r\n  mlflow_predict_flavor(model, df)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut I'm not really sure what to do about that `raw_toChar` call. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nBTW, awesome job on this library! I'm super excited about it.","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/693/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
