I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe MLflow server executes gunicorn with a hard-coded value `mlflow.server:app` ([reference](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/__init__.py#L106)) gunicorn application cli parameter. This prevents easy customization of the MLflow server Flask app i.e. adding `bofore_request` hooks.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nThe goal is adding a `before_request` hook to perform authorization by checking JWT authenication header provided by an AWS application load balancer \r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nIn order to allow extra flexibility for self-hosted MLflow users to customize the mlflow Flask server with pre/post request hooks \r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nThis would simplify the logic for authorization of users of the MLflow server\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nBecause MLflow server doesn't natively allow custom pre/post process  request hooks for the tracking  webserver component\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable that the aforementioned gunicorn app entrypoint can be overridden by a custom value (either via --gunicorn-opts or an additional `mlflow server` cli option)\r\n\r\nIdeally one would be able to write a custom script as this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# customapp.py\r\n\r\nfrom flask import request\r\nfrom mlflow.server import app\r\n\r\n@app.before_request\r\ndef hook():\r\n    print(request.path)\r\n```\r\nand run:\r\n`mlflow server ... --gunicorn-app customapp:app`\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7566/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
