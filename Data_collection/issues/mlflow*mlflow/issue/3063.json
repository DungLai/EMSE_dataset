Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: WSL 2, Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.9.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.1\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen running the docker example from mlflow/examples/docker in kubernetes it fails with the following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29867749/86822429-87cf9b00-c083-11ea-83e8-894659910b85.png)\r\n\r\nInspecting the logs I get this error message:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29867749/86822562-b2215880-c083-11ea-862e-47cfced357aa.png)\r\n\r\nHaving done some investigation, this seems to be due to the environment variable MLFLOW_RUN_ID being set at some point in the creation of the docker image from the base docker_env image. You can see this is the case by adding os.environ[\"MLFLOW_RUN_ID\"] = \"\"  before the mlflow.start_run() line in the train.py file. Doing so completes the run without any issues as per the screenshot below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29867749/86822075-10017080-c083-11ea-84b2-10e63002a1a5.png)\r\n\r\nNote that I get the same error with the mlflow/python version specified in the original docker example and when I updated it to use the latest mlflow version (see Dockerfile attached).\r\n[Dockerfile.txt](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/files/4886458/Dockerfile.txt)\r\n\r\nI've looked through the code to try to figure out where this is happening and how to fix it but no success so far. I'm happy to submit a bug fix with some help from the mlflow community.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ x] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ x] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3063/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
