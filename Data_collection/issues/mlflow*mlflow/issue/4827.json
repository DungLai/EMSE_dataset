Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Databricks ML runtime 9.0\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nMy training data contains `None` values, and I built a sklearn pipeline with imputer to handle it. Then I train the pipeline model with MLflow tracking enabled:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\ntransformers = [\r\n    (\"numerical\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\"mean\"), [\"foo\", \"bar\"]),\r\n    ......\r\n]\r\npreprocessor = ColumnTransformer([\r\n    transformers, remainder=\"passthrough\", sparse_threshold=0)\r\nmodel = Pipeline([\r\n    (\"preprocessor\", preprocessor),\r\n    (\"classifier\", DecisionTreeClassifier(...)),\r\n])\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"my_run\") as mlflow_run:\r\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n    mlflow.sklearn.eval_and_log_metrics(model, X_val, y_val)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trained model itself is able to do `predict` with no problem\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nmodel.predict(X_train)  # ==> OK\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the the `pyfunc` object I got from MLflow doesn't work:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nmodel_pyfunc = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\r\n  'runs:/{run_id}/model'.format(\r\n    run_id=mlflow_run.info.run_id\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nmodel_pyfunc.predict(X_train)\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<command-4119235480823764> in <module>\r\n      5 )\r\n      6 \r\n----> 7 model_pyfunc.predict(X_train)\r\n\r\n/databricks/python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py in predict(self, data)\r\n    594         if input_schema is not None:\r\n    595             data = _enforce_schema(data, input_schema)\r\n--> 596         return self._model_impl.predict(data)\r\n    597 \r\n    598     @property\r\n\r\n/databricks/python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py in <lambda>(*args, **kwargs)\r\n    118 \r\n    119         # lambda, but not partial, allows help() to work with update_wrapper\r\n--> 120         out = lambda *args, **kwargs: self.fn(obj, *args, **kwargs)\r\n    121         # update the docstring of the returned function\r\n    122         update_wrapper(out, self.fn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happened only to data with `None` values. If I run inference to a subset of `X_train` without `None`, the `model_pyfunc.predict` function also works.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yxiong","id":6031534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzE1MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6031534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/yxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxiong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
