My proposal is to consider this as an important issue for mlflow and to prioritize pull requests and issues that goes in this direction.\r\nHere are some ideas : \r\n* being able to retrieve only some of the metrics, tags, params https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2212 => improve the backend speed by about x15 but still slow for more than 20000 runs\r\n* using a more efficient storage backend that is adapted to document storage (elastic search, graphql, ...) => that may be a real solution that could truly scale\r\n* I would be glad to hear about other ideas\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe use case would be supporting machine learning practitioners that run as teams or alone thousand of runs for a single experiment. Being able to retrieve these runs and compare them is quite important in this case.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nThe changes would affect the storage backend and possibly the backend API.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this issue is to hear what you think about this ? is it something you consider important for databricks ? are there lot of users of mlflow that have this use case ?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2730/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
