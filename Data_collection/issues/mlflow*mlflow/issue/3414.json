Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: calling `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nIm not sure if this was introduced as a feature or not, but here is the description:\r\n\r\nI have a python function model that wraps around an sklearn model, a class that looks like this:\r\n```\r\nclass GenericModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\r\n\r\n  def __init__(self, model):\r\n    self.model = model\r\n\r\n  def predict(self, input):\r\n    return self.model.predict_proba(input)[:, 1][0]\r\n\r\n  def get_model(self):\r\n    return self.model\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `_load_pyfunc()` function returns an instance of this class above.\r\n\r\nIn version `mlflow==1.7.2` when I call `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model` I get back the correct instance and I can call `get_model()` on the returned object. However in recent updates, like `mlflow==1.11.0`, this method is no longer available on the class.\r\n\r\nI looked through the code and it seems that all that is happening is calling this `_load_pyfunc()` method which should return an instance of this class, but it seems that something is strongly typing it and removing the other custom instance methods I have written on it. \r\n\r\nAm I just missing some information on how python classes work or how the import_module is working? Not entirely sure if this is an feature with MLFlow or just some python stuff.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help!!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCreate a generic PyfuncModel with additional instance methods and see if they are available when calling mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
