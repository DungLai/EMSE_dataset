Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:Ubuntu 18.04.4\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:1.19.1\r\n- **Python version**:Python 3.6.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThought this sanity check is too strict.\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/5784e7e833385e59cd194fd63e4ae5e456abd779/mlflow/utils/proto_json_utils.py#L347\r\n\r\nBased on the official documentation of tensorflow RESTful API https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/api_rest#request_format_2\r\nThe value for inputs key can either a single input tensor or a map of input name to tensors (listed in their natural nested form). Each input can have arbitrary shape and need **not** share the/ same 0-th dimension \r\n\r\nFor example, if our inputs include two tensors, one tensor with shape (-1, 5) (a batch N of product sequences, each with length 5) and one tensor with shape (-1) (it is a multi-classification problem but we don't calculate the prob for all classes, instead, we randomly pick K classes and only calculate the probs of these k classes for all sequences in this batch). K and N are not necessarily the same in each call. \r\n\r\nIt works well in tensorflow serving but doesn't work in mlflow serving due to the above restriction.  \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'localhost:5000/invocations' -d '{\r\n\"inputs\":{\r\n  \"input_seq\":[[101,275,323,444,512],[289,303,156,223,357]],\r\n  \"input_candidates\":[100,101,102,104,107,119,124]\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n{\"error_code\": \"MALFORMED_REQUEST\", \"message\": \"Failed to parse data as TF serving input.
