Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nServer can accept the panda records format while keep order of column as schema\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nPanda's `records` json format is very user friendly way to view an api request. It's also easier to generate openapi or other schema.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nI want to have the server that can accept records format without sacrificing column ordering \r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nMlflow doesn't provide configuration to have this done. With schema saved to the model, it should be easy to enforce ordering.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\nI think the column reordering should be added to this part of the code. Should be 1 line change.\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/d5a2b06f17d8936cf8c3adea141e902f8f470b2f/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py#L356-L372","closed_by":{"login":"ducthienbui97","id":10867758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY3NzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10867758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97","html_url":"https://github.com/ducthienbui97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducthienbui97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
