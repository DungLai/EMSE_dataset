Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen loading a checkpoint file from local path in Jupyter, I am getting the exception below. Not sure if I miss something in the code or just a bug while dealing with checkpoints.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMlflowException                           Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-14-b121e4342907> in <module>\r\n     26 #         mlflow.pytorch.save_model(model, args.checkpoint_path)\r\n     27         mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, 'models')\r\n---> 28         model = mlflow.pytorch.load_model(args.checkpoint_path)\r\n     29         model.eval()\r\n     30 \r\n\r\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py in load_model(model_uri, **kwargs)\r\n    337             code_path=os.path.join(local_model_path, code_subpath))\r\n    338 \r\n--> 339     pytorch_conf = _get_flavor_configuration(model_path=local_model_path, flavor_name=FLAVOR_NAME)\r\n    340     if torch.__version__ != pytorch_conf[\"pytorch_version\"]:\r\n    341         _logger.warning(\r\n\r\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/utils/model_utils.py in _get_flavor_configuration(model_path, flavor_name)\r\n     22                 \"Could not find an \\\"MLmodel\\\" configuration file at \\\"{model_path}\\\"\".format(\r\n     23                     model_path=model_path),\r\n---> 24                 RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST)\r\n     25 \r\n     26     model_conf = Model.load(model_configuration_path)\r\n\r\nMlflowException: Could not find an \"MLmodel\" configuration file at \"/mnt/data/stamp_recog/checkpoints/all_checkpoint.pt\"\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        \r\n        model = StampNet(args.num_classes)\r\n        mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, 'models')\r\n        model = mlflow.pytorch.load_model(args.checkpoint_path)\r\n        model.eval()\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
