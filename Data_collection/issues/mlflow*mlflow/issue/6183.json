Willingness to contribute\n\nYes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.27.0\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution MacOS 12.1**:\r\n- **Python version 3.8.13**:\n\n### Describe the problem\n\n`log_params` seems to use different validation logic for max. parameter value length compared to `log_param`.\r\nAccording to doc, parameter value should support length up to 5000 but in fact 250 limit seems to be there.\r\nThis passes:\r\n```\r\nsome_params= {'p': [float(c) for c in range(int(45))]}\r\nmlflow.log_param('p', some_params['p'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the same parameter logged with `log_params` will cause error\r\n```\r\nmlflow.log_params(some_params)\r\n```\n\n### Tracking information\n\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.27.0\r\nTracking URI: file:///***/mlflow-bug/mlruns\r\nArtifact URI: file:///***/mlflow-bug/mlruns/0/726fe0e42d564b7a93e395cb81fa593f/artifacts\r\n```\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nprint(\"MLflow version:\", mlflow.__version__)\r\nprint(\"Tracking URI:\", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nprint(\"Artifact URI:\",

mlflow.start_run(experiment_id='0'):\r\n    rid2 = mlflow.active_run().info.run_id\r\n    mlflow.log_params(some_params)\r\n```\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n```python-traceback\r\nTraceback (most
