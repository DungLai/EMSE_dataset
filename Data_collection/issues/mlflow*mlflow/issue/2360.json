For some models, you may want extra inputs, which is why, for example, [sklearn allows additional keyword args to be passed into a pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html#sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.predict)\r\nI suggest allowing keyword args for Pyfunc models as well.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nI appreciate a similar result can be achieved by making `model_input` a `dict`, containing a number of inputs. However, I do think it makes sense to keep the APIs reasonably consistent between the sklearn and pyfunc implementations.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n* `PythonModel.predict` to allow `**kwargs`\r\n* `_PythonModelPyfuncWrapper.predict` to take `**kwargs` and pass through to `PythonModel.predict`","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2360/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
