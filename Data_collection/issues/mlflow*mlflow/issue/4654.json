Parameters and metrics are correctly shown.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nBelow is the minimal code to reproduce my issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport yaml\r\ndef main():\r\n    with open(config_file, 'r') as cfile:\r\n         yml = yaml.load(cfile, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)\r\n     # copy config files\r\n    mlflow.log_dict(yml, \"config.yaml\")\r\n    mlflow.log_artifact(yml['model-config-file'])\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"/out/mlruns\")\r\n    mlflow.set_experiment(\"dummy-test\") \r\n    \r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, to launch the UI, I go to the parent directory of mlruns and run `mlflow ui -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`\r\n``` tree mlruns/\r\nmlruns/\r\n├── ...\r\n└── 1\r\n    ├── 3822fcba86334cf08754bf5baf37a36a\r\n    │   ├── artifacts\r\n    │   │   ├── config.yaml\r\n    │   │   └── model.yaml\r\n    │   ├── meta.yaml\r\n    │   ├── metrics\r\n    │   ├── params\r\n    │   └── tags\r\n    │       ├── mlflow.source.name\r\n    │       ├── mlflow.source.type\r\n    │       └── mlflow.user\r\n    └── meta.yaml\r\nmlflow ui -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nIn my complete code I also log the model and tensorboard data into a directory with `mlflow.log_artifacts(log_path, artifact_path=\"tf_logs\")`. Data are correctly copied in the artifact directory but are not seen either.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
