I wanted to file this to document the issue for anyone else looking and can't upgrade to 1.11.0 yet. I believe https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3360 fixes the issue. \r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- OS Platform and Distribution: OSX\r\n- MLflow installed from: pip\r\n- MLflow versions: 1.5.0 to 1.10.0  (haven't tested pre-1.5.0)\r\n- Python version: 3.7 and 3.8\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nPython MLFlow library cannot download artifacts from databricks if the tracking URI is not set via `mlflow.set_tracking_uri` which sets the tracking uri globally instead of for just that instance of the client. If you run the code below, you will get an exception on the download_artifacts line. Uncomment the two commented lines and it will work. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nmlflow_test.py\r\n```\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient\r\n\r\n# Change me\r\nexperiment_id = 99999999\r\nrun_id = 'f999999999999999999999999999999999'\r\nsample_artifact = 'artifact.json'\r\n\r\nclient = MlflowClient('databricks')\r\n# import mlflow\r\n# mlflow.set_tracking_uri('databricks')\r\nclient.search_runs(experiment_id, max_results=1)\r\nclient.download_artifacts(run_id, sample_artifact)\r\n```\r\n\r\nException:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mlflow_test.py\", line 10, in <module>\r\n    client.download_artifacts('f999999999999999999999999999999999', 'artifact.json')\r\n  File \"/Users/kparajuli/repos/my_cool_project/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 306, in download_artifacts\r\n    return self._tracking_client.download_artifacts(run_id, path, dst_path)\r\n  File \"/Users/kparajuli/repos/my_cool_project/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 300, in download_artifacts\r\n    artifact_repo = get_artifact_repository(artifact_root)\r\n  File \"/Users/kparajuli/repos/my_cool_project/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact/artifact_repository_registry.py\", line 102, in get_artifact_repository\r\n    return _artifact_repository_registry.get_artifact_repository(artifact_uri)\r\n  File \"/Users/kparajuli/repos/my_cool_project/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact/artifact_repository_registry.py\", line 71, in get_artifact_repository\r\n    return repository(artifact_uri)\r\n  File \"/Users/kparajuli/repos/my_cool_project/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact/dbfs_artifact_repo.py\", line 188, in dbfs_artifact_repo_factory\r\n    return DbfsRestArtifactRepository(cleaned_artifact_uri)\r\n  File \"/Users/kparajuli/repos/my_cool_project/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact/dbfs_artifact_repo.py\", line 36, in __init__\r\n    self.get_host_creds = _get_host_creds_from_default_store()\r\n  File \"/Users/kparajuli/repos/my_cool_project/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact/dbfs_artifact_repo.py\", line 153, in _get_host_creds_from_default_store\r\n    raise MlflowException('Failed to get credentials for DBFS;
