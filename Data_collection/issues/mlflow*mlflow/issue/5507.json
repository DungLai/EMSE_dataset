Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nRetrieve models more efficiently by lowering required amount of requests.\r\n\r\nCurrently to retrieve a model we have to do 3 requests:\r\nexperiment_name=\"energy_forecast_10001_Amsterdam\"\r\nexperiment = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name)\r\nrun = mlflow.search_runs(experiment.experiment_id, max_results=1)\r\nmodel = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(os.path.join(run.artifact_uri[0], \"model/\"))\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this can be speeded up by getting model in only 1 request:\r\nmodel = mlflow.sklearn.load_latest_model(experiment_name)\r\n\r\nor 2 requests:\r\nrun = mlflow.search_runs(experiment_name, max_results=1)\r\nmodel = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(os.path.join(run.artifact_uri[0], \"model/\"))\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nPerformance\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nPerformance for all users to load models.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nPerformance.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nIt's more difficult/impossible to improve the performance at higher level when lower calls are not performant.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [X] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here.
