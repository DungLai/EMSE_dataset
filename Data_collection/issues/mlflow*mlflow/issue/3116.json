Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/concepts.html\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nIt is not clear whether the `mlflow server` includes only mlflow tracking or both (mlflow tracking and model registry). In the docs (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#mlflow-tracking-servers) the server is only listed in the tracking section. But from the UI perspective it seems that the server also includes the model registry.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to document the server as a own component in the Mlflow concepts section and list all features (such as tracking) of the server.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"raman-nbg","id":20013423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDEzNDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20013423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg","html_url":"https://github.com/raman-nbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raman-nbg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
