When I go to the experiments page > click on a run > and attempt to click on the registered model, the link is broken because the static prefix is missing. Screenshot:\r\n![MLFlow_static_prefix_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57337661/70948473-25e51080-2021-11ea-8583-9b46bdc1c0ac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Start mlflow tracking server using:\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql://<user>:<password>@<ip>/<db> --default-artifact-root <path/to/a/local/dir> --host 0.0.0.0 --static-prefix /myprefix\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Train model (steps from tutorial):\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow\r\ncd examples\r\npython sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py\r\n```\r\nwith the following lines added to examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py:\r\n```\r\n    remote_server_uri = \"http://localhost:5000\"\r\n    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(remote_server_uri)\r\n    mlflow.set_experiment(\"/my-experiment-at-subpath\")\r\n```\r\n3. Go to http://localhost:5000/myprefix/#/,  navigate to the run and use the UI to register the model.\r\n\r\nThe link to the model is now broken because it does not include the static prefix (see screenshot).","closed_by":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
