Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS Monterey 12.2.1\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: `pip install mlflow`\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.25.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.12\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow run https://github.com/adin786/mlflow-test.git`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nI have written an Mlflow Project specified by an `MLproject` file, in a Github hosted repo.  When creating this repo, Github defaults to calling the starting branch **'origin/main'** rather than the old name **'origin/master'**.\r\n\r\nThis causes an issue for mlflow.  When I run `mlflow run https://github.com/adin786/mlflow-test.git` without specifying a branch name directly, it fails with the following error message \r\n\r\n```\r\n2022/04/18 22:49:00 INFO mlflow.projects.utils: === Fetching project from https://github.com/adin786/mlflow-test.git into /var/folders/n6/8q8ymx711f981rrq8_6rqnj80000gp/T/tmposbzzzxi ===\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/bin/mlflow\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(cli())\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1130, in __call__\r\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1055, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1657, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1404, in invoke\r\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 760, in invoke\r\n    return __callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/cli.py\", line 178, in run\r\n    projects.run(\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 329, in run\r\n    submitted_run_obj = _run(\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 95, in _run\r\n    submitted_run = backend.run(\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/projects/backend/local.py\", line 46, in run\r\n    work_dir = fetch_and_validate_project(project_uri, version, entry_point, params)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/projects/utils.py\", line 130, in fetch_and_validate_project\r\n    work_dir = _fetch_project(uri=uri, version=version)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/projects/utils.py\", line 164, in _fetch_project\r\n    _fetch_git_repo(parsed_uri, version, dst_dir)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/projects/utils.py\", line 202, in _fetch_git_repo\r\n    repo.create_head(\"master\", origin.refs.master)\r\n  File \"/Users/azam/miniforge3/envs/mlflow-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/git/util.py\", line 1001, in __getattr__\r\n    return list.__getattribute__(self, attr)\r\nAttributeError: 'IterableList' object has no attribute 'origin/master'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the module `mlflow.projects.utils` contains a call to `repo.create_head(\"master\", origin.refs.master)` if the `--version` flag is not specified.  So mlflow is assuming there is a **'master'** branch and fails because my repo only contains **'main'**.\r\n\r\nI found that the issue does not occur if I do one of the following:\r\n- I specify `--version` with a commit hash like `cf576c14af64e4814aa31e7e524c1a6d9f024266`\r\n- I specify `--version` with `main`\r\n\r\n**Suggestion:** First check if `master` or `main` exist as branches.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nCreate a github repo with the following 3 files:\r\n\r\n**MLproject** file:\r\n```yaml\r\nname: project_test\r\n\r\nconda_env: conda.yaml\r\n\r\nentry_points: \r\n  main:\r\n    command: \"python train.py\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**conda.yaml** file:\r\n```yaml\r\nname: mlflow-test\r\nchannels:\r\n  - conda-forge\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - pip=22.0.4\r\n  - python=3.8.12\r\n  - pip:\r\n    - mlflow==1.25.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**train.py** file:\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    mlflow.log_param('my_param', 99)\r\n    mlflow.log_metric('my_metric', 55555)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run:\r\n```bash\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \"commit message\"\r\ngit push\r\nmlflow run <github-repo-url>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
