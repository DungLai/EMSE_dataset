We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @dbczumar in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nMLflow provides a deployments API / CLI for CRUDing real-time scoring deployments from MLflow models. This is a pluggable / extendable interface, and plugins currently exist for deployment to Azure ML, TorchServe, Redis, and more. MLflow's tool for deploying models to SageMaker isn't currently exposed through the deployments API / CLI; rather, it has a separate `mlflow sagemaker` CLI / `mlflow.sagemaker` API for legacy reasons. For consistency, we propose to move SageMaker deployment functionality into the `mlflow deployments` CLI / API.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? This feature unifies MLflow's real-time scoring deployment integrations behind a single API.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? It's difficult for users to reason about separate APIs for different deployment environments. A unified API will reduce friction.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Databricks customers deploy models to a variety of locations. It's difficult for them to reason about separate APIs for SageMaker deployment.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? There is no SageMaker deployment functionality conforming to the MLflow plugin specification.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [X] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [X] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nWe propose to migrate the `mlflow.sagemaker` module to a plugin specification that still lives within the main MLflow repository and implements the deployment plugin interface: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/deployments/base.py.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
