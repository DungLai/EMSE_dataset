But the request to the server was `/get-artifact?path=model%2Fdata%2Fmodel%2FMLmodel&run_uuid=b24a79fc37354db180051a8aa51b87ef` which is the wrong path. So there is likely a UI bug that is causing this to happen to this MLModel artifact in particular. It does not happen with any other artifact. Confirmed that MLModel exists in GCS under `model/MLModel` not `/model/data/model/MLmodel`.\r\n\n\n### Tracking information\n\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: REDACTED\r\nArtifact URI: gs://REDACTED\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nRun mlflow server with postgres DB and GCS artifact: `mlflow server --backend-store-uri POSTGRES_URI --default-artifact-root gs://GCS_BUCKET\r\nCall get-artifact on a artifact location that doesn't exists. The 404 error won't be caught and a 500 error will be thrown. \r\nTo reproduce the UI sending a bad artifact path: Use tensorflow autolog to log a simple MLModel and then try to click on the MLModel in UI a few times, including clicking into `/model/data/model/`, this triggered the issue for us where when we clicked on `/model/MLModel` afterwards, it sent a bad get-artifact request for `/model/data/model/MLModel`.\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [X] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5860/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
