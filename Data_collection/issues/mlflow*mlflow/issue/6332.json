Every tweaks that I want to apply to the curves (like change the smoothness for example) is also slower when X = Time (Relative). The biggest problem is that when I load a loss metric it’s by default with Time (Relative) as X, so whenever I want to check a curve it’s very slow. Is it normal that it's that slow ? And if yes, can we at least change the default configuration ?\r\nI use the database configuration btw, but it was slower with a file configuration.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the bug\r\n\r\nCheck any metric curve with at least 8000 steps","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
