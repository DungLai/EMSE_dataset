Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Databricks 6.6 (Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: N/A\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI am using Databricks 6.6, but connecting to an external MLFlow server with a set tracking URI. When I run 'with mlflow.start_run():', an initial run is created. The run takes 1.7h to complete. About 1 hr in, a second run is created with a different job ID. When we run the same code using databricks as the tracking_uri, only one run is created throughout the entire process. Is there possibly a bug when connecting to external mlflow server from databricks that could cause a new run to be created during the initial run?\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
