I can contribute this feature independently.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nWe need to be able to add custom metadata to the `MLmodel` file.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to add metadata to the `MLmodel` file in order to give additional information how the model should be deployed.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nOur models are deployed differently according to their characteristics. It would be nice to keep this information in the registry.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nThe `kwargs` aren't passed to the constructor so it is impossible to achieve this use case.\r\n\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7235/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
