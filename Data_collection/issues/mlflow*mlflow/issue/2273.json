There is no option to select or deselect all parameters or metrics.  A button to select/deselect all parameters/metrics should be added.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nMost experiments/runs have many parameters, but only few are changed between runs or are relevant for run comparison analysis. Since all parameters are enabled in Parallel Coordinates Plot by default, it costs much time to deselect irrelevant parameters. Furthermore, having many parameters enabled in Parallel Coordinates Plots, the UI is less responsive, which increases time further to set up the plot as wanted. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nAdd buttons for parameters and metrics to toggle selection of parameters/metrics.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
