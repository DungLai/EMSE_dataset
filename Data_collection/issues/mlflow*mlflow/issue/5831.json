I don't know if this can be labeled as feature request since I'm still quite new to the library and hence I'm creating a blank issue. Feel free to delete this if it's not the right place to discuss this matter but I'm looking for some insight on this and I think this is the best place to find expert opinions.\r\n\r\nThat being said, are there any resources or insights on handling multiple tracking servers concurrently? We're trying to deploy a simple FastAPI that basically launches, potentially concurrently, multiple runs on different Tracking Servers using the MLflow Python API. We've seen that there's no clear way to explicitly assign the Tracking URI during the `mlflow.projects.run` function and so we're obliged to use `set_tracking_uri` every time before launching the new run (which I quote \"does not affect the currently active run (if one exists), but takes effect for successive runs.\"). Problem is that it may happens that multiple runs go in conflict between each other and some random errors like `mlflow.exceptions.RestException: RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` may occur.\r\nIs there a way to handle this use case scenario or MLflow is still too unripe to be handling multiple tracking servers on a single endpoint like this?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5831/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
