Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nWithin a runs page, the fields `user_id` and `lifecycle_stage` should be links that, when clicked, execute a search for runs that match the current run's criteria.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if I am viewing a run initiated by myself, I should be able to click my user_id which will execute a runs search of all other runs that I have initiated in the experiments page view.\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nImproved UX navigation and ease of use.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nIt prevents users from having to maintain perform as many actions for common tasks for navigation within the UI.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nIt is not supported currently.\n\n###
