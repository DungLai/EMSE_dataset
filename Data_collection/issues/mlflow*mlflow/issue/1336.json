Giving users and organizations control over the way they (post-process and) visualize their configurations, metrics and artifacts could speedup experimentation, analysis, and reporting dramatically.\r\n\r\nSome use cases:\r\n- hierarchical configuration\r\n  Experiments with many components usually need a nested configuration structure (dictionary). \r\n\r\n- multi-dimensional metrics\r\n  Some metrics might not be scalars, but 2d (e.g. histograms) or 3d. \r\n\r\n- model comparison\r\n  One might want to visualize and compare model architectures.\r\n\r\nAn API for creating UI plugins that customize the experiment, run and run comparison views could be the solution.\r\n\r\nIn a [slack discussion](https://mlflow-users.slack.com/messages/CFYUVSHEZ/), @jhadjar suggested that, this can be implemented using  Flask's Blueprint. The core (mlflow ui) application can discover plugins using `find_packages` from `setuptools`, register them and display them _if the plugins want to be displayed_.","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1336/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
