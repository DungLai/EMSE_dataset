Can it be altered in order to not use git at all and continue the execution of project?\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIn deployment of an application using MLflow in production, it may be possible that a customer may not allow installation of git as it will be able to get code from a remote repository.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nIt may be inferred from an environment variable if git is to be used. This would bring a change in the ```run``` API of ```mlflow.projects```.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
