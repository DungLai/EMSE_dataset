Similar to the plugin system for Tracking & Artifact repository, a plugin system based on python's entrypoint groups which is then picked up by mlflow is one way of doing it\r\n\r\nThere will be three (or more in the future) allowed serving methods - `deploy`, `delete` & `run-local` (shamelessly copied from sagemaker). User can specify which method to call and which plugin to use. MLflow look for the plugin and then searches whether the plugin has that function defined or not. If defined, it calls the function with given parameters\r\n\r\n#### From CLI\r\n```mlflow redisai deploy ...```\r\nWe could also group it under `serving` subcommand but that makes the whole command ugly. It could look like ```mlflow serving redisai deploy```\r\n\r\n#### From program\r\n```mlflow.serving.deploy(plugin='redisai', *args, **kwargs)```\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n* PR: #2327 \r\n* [API usage examples](https://gist.github.com/smurching/f00e3b771b2956da7281c427b5f5a681)\r\n* [Design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KsyYO82OtHPEV4Uq8_ukDyZdBfgt7EuCtE2zFSQVea4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=109660911842186433457)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hhsecond","id":13761737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYxNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13761737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond","html_url":"https://github.com/hhsecond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
