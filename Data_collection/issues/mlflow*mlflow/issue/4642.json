Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: npm\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.18.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: 6.14.11\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThere should be a hyperlink in the `source` attribute that directs to the repository where this run was logged from \r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nThe hyperlink in the `source` attribute is not working for self-hosted bitbucket. As you can see it in the following photo:\r\n![Git commit is not clickable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36420198/127988631-700395d3-a1ac-4a94-aa41-53529a816d41.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nTry to use MLflow projects to run from a repository on self-hosted bitbucket.\r\nfor example: `mlflow run https://bitbucket.XXXX.XXXX.com/XXXX/mlflow-docker.git -v kube_backend -P alpha=0.5`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
