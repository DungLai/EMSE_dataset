I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.30.0\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu18\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.2\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nBased on doc: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html\r\n> Use --default-artifact-root (defaults to local ./mlruns directory) to configure default location to serverâ€™s artifact store. This will be used as artifact location for newly-created experiments that do not specify one. Once you create an experiment, --default-artifact-root is no longer relevant to that experiment.\r\n\r\nThis is not my observation; \r\n```\r\n(py39) param@param:~/projects/mlops-zoomcamp/02-experiment-tracking/homework$ mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///backend.db\r\nOption 'default-artifact-root' is required when backend store is not local file based.\r\nUsage: mlflow server [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\nError: Option 'default-artifact-root' is required when backend store is not local file based.\r\n(py39)

preprocess_data.py  register_model.py  train.py\r\n```\r\nNote: \r\n* mlruns folder is present in the directory but mlflow does not treat it as the default artifact-root. \r\n\r\nFollowing commandline is the workaround I used to get mlflow server up \\\r\n```\r\n(py39) param@param:~/projects/mlops-zoomcamp/02-experiment-tracking/homework$ mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///backend.db
