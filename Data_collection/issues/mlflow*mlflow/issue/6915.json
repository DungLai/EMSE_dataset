I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nI suggest that MLflow should add an option to automatically log run parameters that are passed in MLflow project run, or not to do so\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nWhen users wanted to pass in parameters to the run that are not related to the performance of the ML algorithm, hence, do not want to log these parameters\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nBetter UX\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nSame reason as above\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nIt is not difficult\n\n### Details\n\nCurrently, when I start a MLflow project run (regardless called from API or CLI), the parameters that I passed into the project run is automatically logged.\r\nFor example, if I call from CLI: \r\n`mlflow run my-project -P alpha=10 -P beta=20`\r\nMLflow will automatically log alpha and beta to the parameters of my run, whether I want it or not. I suggest that MLflow should add an option to log those parameter or not to do so, because in some cases, the users may not want to log some parameters.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
