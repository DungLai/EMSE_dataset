So far it is either unable to access the s3 bucket (invalid access token) or I've had to configure client side credentials.  When I configure client side credentials i am able to load a model to the registry.  Also, I can use the mlflow client to list registered models just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince the mlflow server is running in a container do you need to map a folder so that it can access aws credentials? Do the credentials need to be stored in environment variables when the server is started? How else would the mlflow server in the container get the aws credentials to access the S3 bucket? \r\n\r\nThis is what I'm running to start the mlflow server:\r\n`CMD mlflow server --backend-store-uri ${BACKEND_URI} --default-artifact-root ${ARTIFACT_ROOT} \\ \r\n    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --artifacts-destination ${ARTIFACT_ROOT} \\ \r\n    --serve-artifacts`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zstern","id":22846606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODQ2NjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22846606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern","html_url":"https://github.com/zstern","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstern/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
