Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe experiment list sidebar is fixed width and truncates long experiment names, making it difficult to sift through. It would be nice to be able to have a resizable sidebar which I could use to look through my experiments easier\r\n\r\n<img width=\"566\" alt=\"mlflow-experiment-list-ui\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64787634/81738566-e43d8200-9467-11ea-9c36-4271c4a932bb.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nAllows for longer experiment names to be practical. Enables prefixing experiment names with things like username, issue numbers, architecture, and other meta-information.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nAllows users to have more freedom in how they choose to name experiments.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nI would like to prefix my experiment names and currently that would make them too long to appear nicely in the UI.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nIf I have many experiments which are named \"\\<username\\>/\\<issue name\\>/\\<experiment name\\>\" then they will appear truncated in the UI and I am unable to see the descriptive part of the name. Hovering over many of these would be cumbersome to finding the one I want. Additionally, I cannot easily set or search through experiment tags in the UI, so the name is the only place to store information about an experiment.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"248\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 3 48 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64787634/81738659-0d5e1280-9468-11ea-8218-0c05ef9915c5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
