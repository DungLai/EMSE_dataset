Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\nMLFlow 1.20.2\r\nAWS Sagemaker Serverless\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nAWS Sagemaker has introduced a [serverless inference solution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html) that supposedly is seamless with the models/docker containers used with real-time inference.   However using the `mlflow-pyfunc` 1.20.2 image, that does work with real-time inference endpoints, when standing up a serverless endpoint I get a `Permission denied: '/opt/mlflow/conda.yaml'` error that causes the endpoint to fail creation.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Train an sklearn model and log with MLflow (`mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`)\r\n2. Create and push container to AWS ECR using `mlflow sagemaker build-and-push-container`\r\n3. Create Sagemaker model from model.tar.gz using the image created above\r\n4. Create [Sagemaker endpoint configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints-create.html#serverless-endpoints-create-config) for the newly created model\r\n5. Create Sagemaker endpoint using the configuration\r\n6. Wait for the endpoint to be created - fails with `Permission denied: '/opt/mlflow/conda.yaml'`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nCloudwatch logs for the endpoint that failed to create...\r\n\r\n```2022-03-18T11:46:40.882-04:00\tOpenBLAS WARNING - could not determine the L2 cache size on this system, assuming 256k\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tFile \"/miniconda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py\", line 44, in _init\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\t_serve()\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tFile \"/miniconda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py\", line 71, in _serve\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\t_serve_pyfunc(m)\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tFile \"/miniconda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py\", line 124, in _serve_pyfunc\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\t_install_pyfunc_deps(MODEL_PATH, install_mlflow=True)\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tFile \"/miniconda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py\", line 98, in _install_pyfunc_deps\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tshutil.copyfile(os.path.join(MODEL_PATH, env), env_path_dst)\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tFile \"/miniconda/lib/python3.8/shutil.py\", line 261, in copyfile\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\twith open(src, 'rb') as fsrc, open(dst, 'wb') as fdst:\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/opt/mlflow/conda.yaml'\r\n2022-03-18T11:46:44.293-04:00\tcreating and activating custom environment\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [X] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5544/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
