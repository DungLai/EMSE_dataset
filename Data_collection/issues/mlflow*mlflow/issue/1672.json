Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\nFor help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n  \r\nPlease do not delete this template unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: OSX 10.14\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: PyPI\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.1.0\r\n- **Python version**: 2.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: See below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen executing an MLflow Project on Kubernetes, MLflow builds a docker image containing the project's contents and attempts to push it to a Docker repository specified by the backend configuration file (see https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#execution-guide). When the Docker repository is a private repository, MLflow fails to push the Docker image. This failure occurs even if the user has authenticated with the Docker repository in their shell via `docker login` or provided access credentials in the `~/.docker/config.json` file.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nThe following steps reproduce the issue using the [mlflow/examples/docker example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/docker).\r\n\r\n1. Clone the MLflow repository and check out `master`.\r\n\r\n2. Specify a private Docker repository in the [mlflow/examples/docker/kubernetes_config.json file](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/docker/kubernetes_config.json). For example, I used the repository `dbczumar/mlflow-k8s-test`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"kube-context\": \"docker-for-desktop\",\r\n    \"kube-job-template-path\": \"examples/docker/kubernetes_job_template.yaml\",\r\n    \"repository-uri\": \"dbczumar/mlflow-k8s-test\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Authenticate with the private Docker repository in your shell (either via `docker login` or by providing credentials in your `~/.docker/config.json` file). Confirm that you can push images to this repository.\r\n\r\n4. In the same shell, navigate to the root directory of your MLflow repository and run the following command:\r\n```sh\r\n$ mlflow run examples/docker --backend kubernetes --backend-config examples/docker/kubernetes_config.json -P alpha=0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Observe that the Docker image for the Project builds successfully, but the push process to the private repository fails with a 500-level error:\r\n```\r\n2019/07/26 16:38:23 INFO mlflow.projects: === Building docker image dbczumar/mlflow-k8s-test:96eb9e5 ===\r\n2019/07/26 16:38:30 INFO mlflow.projects.kubernetes: === Pushing docker image dbczumar/mlflow-k8s-test:96eb9e5 ===\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/bin/mlflow\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    load_entry_point('mlflow', 'console_scripts', 'mlflow')()\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 764, in __call__\r\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 717, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1137, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 956, in invoke\r\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 555, in invoke\r\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/mlflow/mlflow/cli.py\", line 137, in run\r\n    run_id=run_id\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/mlflow/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 265, in run\r\n    use_conda=use_conda, storage_dir=storage_dir, synchronous=synchronous, run_id=run_id)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/mlflow/mlflow/projects/__init__.py\", line 171, in _run\r\n    image_digest = kb.push_image_to_registry(image.tags[0])\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/mlflow/mlflow/projects/kubernetes.py\", line 23, in push_image_to_registry\r\n    return client.images.get_registry_data(image_tag).id\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/docker/models/images.py\", line 333, in get_registry_data\r\n    attrs=self.client.api.inspect_distribution(name),\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/docker/utils/decorators.py\", line 34, in wrapper\r\n    return f(self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/docker/utils/decorators.py\", line 19, in wrapped\r\n    return f(self, resource_id, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/docker/api/image.py\", line 266, in inspect_distribution\r\n    self._get(self._url(\"/distribution/{0}/json\", image)), True\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/docker/api/client.py\", line 262, in _result\r\n    self._raise_for_status(response)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/docker/api/client.py\", line 258, in _raise_for_status\r\n    raise create_api_error_from_http_exception(e)\r\n  File \"/Users/czumar/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/docker/errors.py\", line 31, in create_api_error_from_http_exception\r\n    raise cls(e, response=response, explanation=explanation)\r\ndocker.errors.APIError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error (\"errors:\r\ndenied: requested access to the resource is denied\r\nunauthorized: authentication required\r\n\")\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
