Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Mac OS Big Sur 11.3.1 (Apple M1 chip)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: PiPy\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: `1.18.0`\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow models build-docker -m 'models:/{model_name}/{model_version}' -n my-mlflow-image`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI have tried to create a Docker image from a registered model in Mlflow (I am using the Databricks managed version here). The model was registered as a PyFunc.\r\nIt will download the model, identify its flavour and run until the `6/12` step, where it breaks with the following message:\r\n```\r\n#9 0.665 /bin/sh: 1: pip: not found\r\n#9 ERROR: executor failed running [/bin/sh -c pip install mlflow==1.19.0]: exit code: 127\r\n------\r\n > [ 6/12] RUN pip install mlflow==1.19.0:\r\n------\r\nexecutor failed running [/bin/sh -c pip install mlflow==1.19.0]: exit code: 127\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nYou must have a registered model or run in an Mlflow artifact storage. Then:\r\n`mlflow models build-docker -m 'models:/{model_name}/{model_version}' -n my-mlflow-image` or `mlflow models build-docker -m 'runs:/{run_id}/model' -n my-mlflow-image` \r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThe full output from the command is as follows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow models build-docker -m 'runs:/{my_run}/model' -n direct-mlflow-image\r\n2021/07/14 17:25:44 INFO mlflow.models.cli: Selected backend for flavor 'python_function'\r\n2021/07/14 17:25:49 INFO mlflow.models.docker_utils: Building docker image with name direct-mlflow-image\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m/\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m//model_dir\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m//model_dir/model\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m//model_dir/model/MLmodel\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m//model_dir/model/model.pkl\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m//model_dir/model/input_example.json\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m//model_dir/model/conda.yaml\r\n/var/folders/yx/6fcq_tx96n52vr0kc66ypy9w0000gp/T/tmpyesejo4m//Dockerfile\r\n#1 [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile\r\n#1 sha256:c4ce501e24{}\r\n#1 transferring dockerfile: 1.58kB done\r\n#1 DONE 0.0s\r\n\r\n#2 [internal] load .dockerignore\r\n#2 sha256:7094b9fc79b9{}\r\n#2 transferring context: 2B done\r\n#2 DONE 0.0s\r\n\r\n#3 [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/ubuntu:18.04\r\n#3 sha256:fbbba859d4013c87{}\r\n#3 DONE 1.8s\r\n\r\n#4 [ 1/12] FROM docker.io/library/ubuntu:18.04@sha256:3b8692dc4{}\r\n#4 sha256:f601b492ef7f7c5a96{}\r\n#4 DONE 0.0s\r\n\r\n#5 [ 2/12] RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends          wget          curl          nginx          ca-certificates          bzip2          build-essential          cmake          openjdk-8-jdk          git-core          maven     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\r\n#5 sha256:28ae033a3a{}\r\n#5 CACHED\r\n\r\n#6 [ 3/12] RUN curl -L https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh >> miniconda.sh\r\n#6 sha256:3dd39dfce1f4b9{}\r\n#6 CACHED\r\n\r\n#7 [ 4/12] RUN bash ./miniconda.sh -b -p /miniconda;
