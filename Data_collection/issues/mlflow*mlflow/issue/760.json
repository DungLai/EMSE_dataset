While using Bitbucket, the Git Commit produces the git commit id but doesn't produce a hyperlink to direct it to the Bitbucket commit page. Due to this, the developer has to manually enter the commit version and the open bitbucket to see the respective changes. Bitbucket integration is also an important need for individuals/corporations who use Bitbucket instead of Github. The use case is that a lot of developers can go straight to Bitbucket instead of Github and view their commits. \r\n\r\nNo Bitbucket Hyperlink Generated: \r\n<img width=\"1165\" alt=\"no hyperlink generated\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32715765/50149190-817ea000-02e0-11e9-9342-e345a93140d7.png\">\r\n\r\nLocally Stored runs \r\n<img width=\"1391\" alt=\"locally stored runs\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32715765/50145840-76277680-02d8-11e9-8a33-b69e48e097a3.png\">\r\n\r\nDetails captured of a single run\r\n<img width=\"1209\" alt=\"details captured of a single run\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32715765/50145839-76277680-02d8-11e9-8152-d793f0b5b932.png\">\r\n\r\nBitbucket hyperlink to the given commit\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"bitbucket hyperlink to the given commit\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32715765/50145838-758ee000-02d8-11e9-93e6-765e4de92b0b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
