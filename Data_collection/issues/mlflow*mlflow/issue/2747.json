I ran into this issue:\r\n```\r\nAn error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the CreateModel operation: 1 validation error detected: Value 'mfs-hello-model-linregmodel-4d7b3f-model-wabch2xdutjqvabw7y-wd4iq' at 'primaryContainer.containerHostname' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must have length less than or equal to 63\r\n```\r\nWith a value for app-name: `hello-model-linregmodel-4d7b3f`. Here I am using the `<experiment_name>-<model_name>-<first6run_id>` to make sure I can correlate the sagemaker endpoints back to a model in MLFlow. While the length of an endpoint-config can be 63 characters, I am limited to half that because there is so much attached to that value `mfs-...-model-wabch2xdutjqvabw7y-wd4iq`.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nMake the resulting `endpoint-config` name shorter so I can put more characters in my `app-name`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
