Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes.  \r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:  OSx Mojave 10.14.5\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: via pip 19.2.3\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.3.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:  see below.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\n\r\nThis command works for entry point `e_train.py`:\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow run ./ -e e_train.py --backend databricks --backend-config databricks_backend.json\r\n```\r\nwith the following MLProject\r\n```yaml\r\nname: myproject\r\nconda_env: conda.yaml\r\nentry_points:\r\n  e_train.py:\r\n    command: \"python mystuff/train.py\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not for entry point named `train`.  The entry point cannot be found (see screenshot and error below).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow run ./ -e train --backend databricks --backend-config databricks_backend.json\r\n```\r\nOnly change is the name of the entry point (`e_train.py` vs `train`).\r\n```yaml\r\nname: myproject\r\nconda_env: conda.yaml\r\nentry_points:\r\n  train:\r\n    command: \"python mystuff/train.py\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44206483/67720134-6cf34580-f990-11e9-962f-d121fa55f5e5.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Could not find train among entry points [] or interpret train as a runnable script. Supported script file extensions: ['.py', '.sh'] ===\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like something about `--backend databricks` requires that the entry point be named with `.py` or `.sh` suffix (a weird pattern).... but not when running `mlflow run` locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Possible related GH issues\r\n\r\nThese have same error, but appears to be for different reasons.  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1094\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1762\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"andrewbrooks-o","id":44206483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjA2NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44206483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewbrooks-o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewbrooks-o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
