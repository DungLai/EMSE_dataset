Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.2.0\r\n- **Python version**: 2.7.15 and 3.6.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: Try to access a specific experiment on http://127.0.0.1:5000\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\nWhen I try to access a specific experiment on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (after initializing mlflow ui), I get the error page \"Oops! Something went wrong.\".\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\nThis error just happens when I try to access one of my experiments. The others work fine.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\nThe log message is as follows:\r\n2019/10/18 13:04:53 ERROR mlflow.server: Exception on /ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/runs/search [POST]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/amanda/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 2446, in wsgi_app\r\n    response = self.full_dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/home/amanda/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1951, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.handle_user_exception(e)\r\n  File \"/home/amanda/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1820, in handle_user_exception\r\n    reraise(exc_type, exc_value, tb)\r\n  File \"/home/amanda/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1949, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/home/amanda/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1935, in dispatch_request\r\n    return self.view_functions[rule.endpoint](**req.view_args)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/server/handlers.py\", line 101, in wrapper\r\n    return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/server/handlers.py\", line 333, in _search_runs\r\n    max_results, order_by, page_token)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/store/abstract_store.py\", line 235, in search_runs\r\n    order_by, page_token)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/store/file_store.py\", line 587, in _search_runs\r\n    run_infos = self._list_run_infos(experiment_id, run_view_type)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/store/file_store.py\", line 567, in _list_run_infos\r\n    run_info = self._get_run_info(r_id)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/store/file_store.py\", line 414, in _get_run_info\r\n    run_info = _read_persisted_run_info_dict(meta)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mlflow/store/file_store.py\", line 65, in _read_persisted_run_info_dict\r\n    dict_copy = run_info_dict.copy()\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'copy'","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1956/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
