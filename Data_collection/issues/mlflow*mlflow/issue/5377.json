Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: `python:3.9.9-slim-bullseye` docker image\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: See below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI have a mlflow server setup which is working fine except from listing artifacts from the ui after having uploaded them.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nI'm running mlflow server as follows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow  server \\\r\n      --host 0.0.0.0 \\\r\n      --port 5000 \\\r\n      --workers 4 \\\r\n      --backend-store-uri postgresql://$DATABASE_USER:$DATABASE_PASSWORD@postgres:5432/mlflow?sslmode=disable \\\r\n      --artifacts-destination s3://my-bucket/artifacts \\\r\n      --serve-artifacts \\\r\n      --gunicorn-opts \"--access-logfile -\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my test experiment is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport random\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://localhost:5000')\r\nmlflow.set_experiment('test-1')\r\n\r\ndef run_experiment():\r\n    mlflow.log_param('name', 'Peter')\r\n    mlflow.log_param('age', 20 + random.random() * 30)\r\n\r\n    output_path = 'output.txt'\r\n    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:\r\n        f.write('Something {}'.format(random.randint(30, 50)))\r\n\r\n    mlflow.log_artifact(output_path)\r\n\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    run_experiment()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nError screenshot:\r\n(I'm getting error 500 on http://localhost:5000/ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/artifacts/list?run_uuid=a86a0e638a1748d3a48587f2d1e00488)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-14 at 13 42 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20804419/153907513-d9c8bc86-aa89-4685-91cb-c44bc3cdb6c6.png)\r\n\r\nServer log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022/02/14 16:44:25 ERROR mlflow.server: Exception on /ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/artifacts/list [GET]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 2073, in wsgi_app\r\n    response = self.full_dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1518, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.handle_user_exception(e)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1516, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1502, in dispatch_request\r\n    return self.ensure_sync(self.view_functions[rule.endpoint])(**req.view_args)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mlflow/server/handlers.py\", line 238, in wrapper\r\n    return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mlflow/server/handlers.py\", line 298, in wrapper\r\n    return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mlflow/server/handlers.py\", line 571, in _list_artifacts\r\n    artifact_entities = _get_artifact_repo(run).list_artifacts(path)\r\nAttributeError: 'Response' object has no attribute 'list_artifacts'\r\n172.22.0.1 - - [14/Feb/2022:16:44:25 +0000] \"GET /ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/artifacts/list?run_uuid=a86a0e638a1748d3a48587f2d1e00488 HTTP/1.1\" 500 290 \"http://localhost:5000/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fix idea\r\n\r\nIn the `mlflow/server/handlers.py` file, in the `_list_artifacts()` method, I've tried using `_get_artifact_repo_mlflow_artifacts()` to fetch the repository instead of trying to fetch it from the run with `_get_artifact_repo(run)` and seems to have worked. Note that the run artifact's schema is `mlflow-artifacts:/` which, to my point of view, does not make sense to be used from the server side.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5377/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
