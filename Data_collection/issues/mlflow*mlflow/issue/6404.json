I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### MLflow version\r\n\r\n1.27.0\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 11\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.13\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI was following the instruction on the [Regression Pipeline repository](https://github.com/mlflow/mlp-regression-template), where I cloned the repo in a folder called **MLflow Pipelines**. However, I got an error when I was trying to run `p.run(\"split\")` cell in [jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/mlflow/mlp-regression-template/blob/main/notebooks/jupyter.ipynb) notebook. The error:\r\n`make: *** No rule to make target 'steps/split/outputs/train.parquet', needed by 'split'.  Stop.`\r\n\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nRun the  [jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/mlflow/mlp-regression-template/blob/main/notebooks/jupyter.ipynb) notebook after cloning the repo in a folder with space in it \r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n\r\nmake: *** No rule to make target 'steps/split/outputs/train.parquet', needed by 'split'.  Stop.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging, I found the problem in the **Makefile** created for the pipeline as it is space sensitive \r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [X] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
