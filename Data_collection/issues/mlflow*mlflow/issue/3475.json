This bug appears only when launching the server on ports different than the usual 5000.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetric display for mlflow version 1.7.2 on every port:\r\n![CaptureMlflow172](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19271957/94706698-d323dd80-0342-11eb-815f-5fbb74508d2b.PNG)\r\n\r\nMetric doesn't display for mlflow version 1.8 or later when port != 5000:\r\n![CaptureMlflow19-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19271957/94706775-eafb6180-0342-11eb-9591-5e96fca91853.PNG)\r\n\r\nHowever when there is only one value for a metric, the bar plot is correctly displayed.\r\nOther than that, the interface works fine.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name='Test'):\r\n    for i in range(10):\r\n        mlflow.log_metric('metric',i, step=i)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nOur web navigator is Firefox v79.0. We work behind the proxy of our company.\r\n\r\nThere isn't any error displayed in the mlflow terminal when this bug happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,\r\nLea","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
