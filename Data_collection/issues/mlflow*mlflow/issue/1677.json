Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\nFor help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n  \r\nPlease do not delete this template unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Centos 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.1.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow artifacts list -r <run id for artifacts stored on hdfs>\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nlist_artifacts of an artifact repository is expected to only list the files directly under the provided path (see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/4b1868719837d1844f19b6242643222549ee2794/mlflow/store/cli.py#L74 ). HdfsArtifactRepository walks all files under the given path and returns them (see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/4b1868719837d1844f19b6242643222549ee2794/mlflow/store/hdfs_artifact_repo.py#L89 ).\r\n\r\nThis behavior breaks the mflow server as it expects the behavior specified in the cli file.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks,\r\nplease include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
