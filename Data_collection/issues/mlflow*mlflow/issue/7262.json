Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nMLflow is a great job, I used it to log and track my experiments.\r\nHowever, it seems the `mlflow.autolog()` can not support the pytorch network with `nn.Module` and tensorflow 1.0~1.15.\r\nIs there any way to support automatic logging for the pytorch and tensorflow-1 version frameworks?\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nSupport more framework\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nCan be used in more experiments\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nSupport more framework\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test
