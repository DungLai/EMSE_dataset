These two processes don't use the same logging format by default. Example:\r\n\r\nGunicorn:\r\n`[2020-01-08 17:55:50 +0000] [19] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4`\r\n\r\nMLFlow:\r\n`2020/01/08 18:22:17 ERROR mlflow.server: Exception on /ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/model-versions/search [GET]`\r\n\r\nGunicorns' logging format can be changed using the mlflow server --gunicorn-opts. It would be useful to be able to do the same for MLFlow. Currently, this is not possible since the MLFlow logging format is not customizable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nAn argument could be added to the mlflow server API: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#mlflow-server to set the MLFLow tracking server logging format. The logging format is currently hardcoded here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/v1.5.0/mlflow/utils/logging_utils.py#L10\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2300/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
