System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes, see below\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: \r\n   Note: In 0.8.2 R tracking is broken, hence I tried this approach with latest master\r\n   $ git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git\r\n   $ cd mlflow/mlflow/R\r\n   $ R CMD build mlflow\r\n   $ R\r\n   > install.packages(\"./mlflow_0.9.0.tar.gz\")\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 0.9.0 (master, with pip install from github)\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.2\r\n- **npm version (if running the dev UI)**: n/a\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: see below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI started with the wine_r project and reduced the source files to a minimum to show the issue:\r\n \r\nMLproject:\r\n```\r\nname: mlflow-r\r\n\r\nentry_points:\r\n  main:\r\n    parameters:\r\n      alpha: float\r\n      lambda: float\r\n    command: \"R -f train.R\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TEST 1**\r\n\r\ntrain.R\r\n```\r\nlibrary(mlflow)\r\nalpha <- mlflow_param(\"alpha\", 0.5, \"numeric\")\r\nlambda <- mlflow_param(\"lambda\", 0.5, \"numeric\")\r\n\r\nwith(mlflow_start_run(), {\r\n  message(\"nop\")\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute:\r\n```\r\n$ mlflow run . -P alpha=0.14 -P lambda=0.14 --experiment-id=$EXID\r\nnop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a run in the tracking server with `alpha=0.14` and `lambda=0.14`\r\n\r\n**TEST 2**\r\n\r\ntrain.R\r\n```\r\nlibrary(mlflow)\r\n\r\nalpha <- mlflow_param(\"alpha\", 0.5, \"numeric\")\r\nlambda <- mlflow_param(\"lambda\", 0.5, \"numeric\")\r\n\r\nwith(mlflow_start_run(), {\r\n  message(\"Elasticnet model (alpha=\", alpha, \", lambda=\", lambda, \"):\")\r\n\r\n  mlflow_log_param(\"alpha\", alpha)\r\n  mlflow_log_param(\"lambda\", lambda)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute:\r\n```\r\n$ mlflow run . -P alpha=0.14 -P lambda=0.14 --experiment-id=$EXID\r\nElasticnet model (alpha=0.5, lambda=0.5):\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output shows `0.5` while again there is is a run with `alpha=0.14` and `lambda=0.14` on the tracking server. \r\nSo there are two things that don't work as I expected:\r\n\r\n1. `alpha <- mlflow_param(\"alpha\", 0.5, \"numeric\")` does not use `-P` parameter values, since the message output shows `0.5` for both params\r\n2. `mlflow_log_param` should set alpha and lambda to `0.5` which it does not\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong here?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bernhard-42","id":954408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NDQwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/954408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42","html_url":"https://github.com/bernhard-42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bernhard-42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1014/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
