I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCreate a new mlflow function in order provide a way to rename the run name. This function could be the `mlflow.set_run_name`\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis feature will allow the user to rename the run name using the Python API. A use-case that makes this feature valuable is the following: Many tools implements their own mlflow integration without allowing the user to specify the flow run name, in that case it's useful to provide a high-level API for this purpose. This renaming functionality is currently supported by setting the `mlflow.runName` tag but this approach is not friendly for a new user. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [x] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThis new function could look like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef set_run_name(run_id: str, name: str):\r\n    pass  # use the given run_id in order to `mlflow.set_tag('mlflow.runName', name)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
