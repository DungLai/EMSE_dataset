Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.18.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: Code below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n`mlflow.tensorflow.log_model` is incompatible with modern TF2 model saving.\r\n\r\nThe documentation states `Note that autologging for tf.keras is handled by mlflow.tensorflow.autolog(), not mlflow.keras.autolog()` and this has lead to a few people (myself included) attempting to save keras models using the tensorflow package instead of the `mlflow.keras` package, believing that the `mlflow.keras` package is for v1 Keras models (prior to it being bought inside `tf.keras`. \r\n\r\nI'd suggest a few potential improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Being explicit in the documentation under `mlflow.tensorflow` and `mlflow.keras` that `tf.keras` models should be manually logged using `mlflow.keras` but automatically logged using `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog`\r\n2. Potentially checking the signatures of the model when using `mlflow.tensorflow.load_model` to provide a proper error message to the user that they should be using `mlflow.keras`\r\n3. Increasing the versatility of the `mlflow.tensorflow.save_model` function to handle both `tf` and `tf.keras` models. It seems this functionality must be buried somewhere in `mlflow` as the `autolog` function will correctly save and load both `tf` and `tf.keras` models.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport mlflow.tensorflow\r\nimport mlflow.pyfunc\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"mlruns\")\r\n    mlflow.set_experiment(\"Default\")\r\n    run = mlflow.start_run()\r\n    # Note that the model works correctly WITH autolog, but not when logging the\r\n    # model manually. Uncomment the below line and comment out the explicit\r\n    # log_model and the code will run. Which probably indicates in incompatibility\r\n    # with mlflow and the modern TF2 way of saving models, as autolog uses v1 methods\r\n    # under the hood\r\n    # mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()\r\n\r\n    # Create dummy data\r\n    n = 10000\r\n    cols = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\r\n    x_train = pd.DataFrame(10 * np.random.normal(size=(n, 3)), columns=cols)\r\n    x_test = pd.DataFrame(10 * np.random.normal(size=(n, 3)), columns=cols)\r\n    y_train = np.random.uniform(size=n) + x_train.sum(axis=1)\r\n    y_test = np.random.uniform(size=n) + x_test.sum(axis=1)\r\n\r\n    # Build the model\r\n    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])\r\n    model.compile(loss=\"mae\")\r\n    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)\r\n    model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)\r\n\r\n    # Save the model\r\n    tempdir = \"/tmp/model\"\r\n    model.save(tempdir)\r\n\r\n    # Verify the model works\r\n    model = tf.keras.models.load_model(tempdir)\r\n    print(model.predict(x_test))  # Works fine\r\n\r\n    # Log and load the model to mlflow\r\n    mlflow.tensorflow.log_model(\r\n        tf_saved_model_dir=tempdir,\r\n        tf_meta_graph_tags=None,\r\n        tf_signature_def_key=\"serving_default\",\r\n        artifact_path=\"model\",\r\n    )\r\n    mlflow.end_run()\r\n    model_uri = f\"mlruns/0/{run.info.run_id}/artifacts/model\"\r\n\r\n    # Load the model from mlflow\r\n    model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)\r\n    # Invoke the model\r\n    print(model.predict(x_test))\r\n    # TypeError: signature_wrapper(*, dense_input) missing required arguments: dense_input\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
