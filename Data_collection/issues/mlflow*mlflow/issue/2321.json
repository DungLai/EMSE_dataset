I understand I can configure kubernetes job template as per my wish which will solve most of the problems for me.\r\n\r\nThe major issue I am facing right now is that the environment variables that I have specified in the MLproject docker_env is not getting drilled to the kubernetes job template rather [three env variables](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/8447c4201ae7306d69b692f5e634c7eb59cf1462/mlflow/projects/__init__.py#L578) are configured while [running kubernetes job](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/8447c4201ae7306d69b692f5e634c7eb59cf1462/mlflow/projects/__init__.py#L196).\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior of the kubernetes backend.. will the specified configurations in docker_env be drilled down directly to the kubernetes run job or are we expecting to treat kubernetes standalone and reconfigure it again as per usage.\r\n\r\nThe issue in the later one is reconfiguring configmaps and secrets again which are already available to me in the mlflow run issuing system via docker_env","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2321/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
