Currently, the `autolog` function plots all features. This might make the plot too dense to understand when the number of features is large.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nAdd a new argument to `autolog` which limits the number of features to plot and update `log_feature_importance_plot`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
