Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: 16.04 (in docker aswell)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:  source (pip install)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:1.3.0 (docker aswell)\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ssYkse/mlflowworkshop.\r\n(sorry, its german, i'll give details below how to reproduce)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nI have created a mlflow.keras model (see train.py), which I wraped inside a pyfunc model (package_model.py) to be able to add the preprocessing to the inference.\r\n\r\nI dockerize this model with mlflow build-docker ..., and serve the model.\r\nWhen sending a Post request to this docker server, i get the following response (edited for legibility):\r\n```\r\ncurl -d \"@exampjson\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json-numpy-split' -X POST localhost:5001/invocations{\"error_code\": \"BAD_REQUEST\", \"message\": \"Encountered an unexpected error while evaluating the model.
