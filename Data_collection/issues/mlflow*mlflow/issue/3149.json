Can anyone help me please. Thank you!\r\n\r\nMy tracking-uri and backend-store-uri are the same mysql database uri\r\nand default-artifact-root is ./mlruns\r\n\r\nI am trying to train an ALS model using pyspark2 ml package and log it by mlflow,\r\nbut on the mlflow ui http://<ip_address>:<port>, I cannot see the model signature and input_example in MLmodel file.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't see the difference for the one I didn't log model with signature and the one I did, in the process of \"train -> models serve -> send data in json file and get prediction \". Could someone tell me how can I see the difference.\r\nThe information of model signature and input_example should be there as I see for model of sklearn flavor.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"902\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-22 at 2 55 09 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60844171/88144342-58945e80-cc2b-11ea-8e54-b685952d7ee2.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1021\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-22 at 3 25 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60844171/88147330-9c896280-cc2f-11ea-9693-aec10c2470b3.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1294\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-22 at 2 56 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60844171/88144486-91ccce80-cc2b-11ea-9966-a0561d2c2e45.png\">\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
