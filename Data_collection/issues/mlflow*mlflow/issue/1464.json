As their manager, I'd rather have one centralized server where the top level of organization is the project they are working on, then within each there are the experiments, and further there are the runs. Is this possible, or is this expected to be possible in future mlflow releases? I really think this would be a useful feature.\r\n\r\nThis comment got several upvotes in the mlflow slack channel, so I am creating an official feature request here.","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1464/reactions","total_count":33,"+1":33,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
