Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this installation issue template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Debian\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: It would be 1.15.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.9\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `pip install mlflow` or `poetry add mlflow`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI would like to install MLflow for our project. This project has as a dependency that the version of alembic is 1.4.2. I have seen that the requirements for MLflow's alembic are <=1.4.1 (due to [#3363](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3363)). \r\nSince future projects with other packages are likely going to need higher alembic versions it would be nice to remove this limiting requirement. Maybe the issue of failing installs was fixed in higher alembic versions already.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n```\r\nBecause mlflow (1.15.0) depends on alembic (<=1.4.1) \r\nand no versions of mlflow match >1.15.0,<2.0.0, mlflow (>=1.15.0,<2.0.0) requires alembic (<=1.4.1).\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4215/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
