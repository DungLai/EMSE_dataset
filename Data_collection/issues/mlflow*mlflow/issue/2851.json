Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes, \r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Arch Linux latest, but using Docker here\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Docker \r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:  latest\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7 something\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run .\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nMultistep workflow with Docker runs into `mlflow.exceptions.ExecutionException: Could not find Docker executable. `.\r\nDocker is clearly installed and should be available, since the run launched successfully and even reused the cached load_raw_data. However, subsequent entrypoints run into the exception.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Zethson/mlflow_custom_ms_example\r\n\r\nThis is a very slightly adapted version of the custom multistep example. Please build the Docker container as `custom_ms_example` and then simply run the project with the usual `mlflow run .`\r\nPlease be aware, that you may run into subsequent errors such as missing JAVA_HOME or something, since the container may not be complete yet, but at this point it does not get to this stage!\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n```\r\nzeth@master ~/P/custom_multistep [1]> mlflow run .
