Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.11 and 1.12\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.9 Anaconda\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCalling `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` yields a warning about being unable to log model metadata and suggests the MLFlow sever may be out of date even though Python package and server are the same version and both are either v1.11.0 or v1.12.0. Removing the try catch generating the warning reveals the length limit of a REST call is being violated.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Clone retinanet-examples repo: https://github.com/NVIDIA/retinanet-examples\r\n2. Instrument to save model using `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` to a Postgres backend store and FTP artifact store.\r\n3. Execute `ODTK train`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThe exact error is:\r\n`2020/11/13 20:54:21 WARNING mlflow.models.model: Logging model metadata to the tracking server has failed, possibly due older server version. The model artifacts have been logged successfully under ftp://mlflow:mlflow@localhost/4/0bb3d83deea74868bb0bf2a838460223/artifacts. In addition to exporting model artifacts, MLflow clients 1.7.0 and above attempt to record model metadata to the  tracking store. If logging to a mlflow server via REST, consider  upgrading the server version to MLflow 1.7.0 or above.`.\r\n\r\nRemoving the `try-catch` from `def log` in `mlflow/models/model.py` reveals the stack trace:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/bin/odtk\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    load_entry_point('odtk', 'console_scripts', 'odtk')()\r\n  File \"/home/repos/retinanet-examples/retinanet/main.py\", line 251, in main\r\n    worker(0, args, 1, model, state)\r\n  File \"/home/repos/retinanet-examples/retinanet/main.py\", line 186, in worker\r\n    regularization_l2=args.regularization_l2, rotated_bbox=args.rotated_bbox, absolute_angle=args.absolute_angle)\r\n  File \"/home/repos/retinanet-examples/retinanet/train.py\", line 241, in train\r\n    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, state['path'])\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py\", line 193, in log_model\r\n    **kwargs\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/models/model.py\", line 163, in log\r\n    mlflow.tracking.fluent._record_logged_model(mlflow_model)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\", line 333, in _record_logged_model\r\n    MlflowClient()._record_logged_model(run_id, mlflow_model)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 299, in _record_logged_model\r\n    self._tracking_client._record_logged_model(run_id, mlflow_model)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 255, in _record_logged_model\r\n    self.store.record_logged_model(run_id, mlflow_model)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/rest_store.py\", line 288, in record_logged_model\r\n    self._call_endpoint(LogModel, req_body)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/rest_store.py\", line 52, in _call_endpoint\r\n    return call_endpoint(self.get_host_creds(), endpoint, method, json_body, response_proto)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py\", line 155, in call_endpoint\r\n    response = verify_rest_response(response, endpoint)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py\", line 117, in verify_rest_response\r\n    raise RestException(json.loads(response.text))\r\nmlflow.exceptions.RestException: INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE: Tag value '[{\"run_id\": \"4f65dbd571364b3483d8cf155d7fa325\", \"artifact_path\": \"test.pth\", \"utc_time_created\": \"2020-11-13 21:01:50.210020\", \"flavors\": {\"pytorch\": {\"model_data\": \"data\", \"pytorch_version\": \"1.5.0a0+8f84ded\"}, \"python_function\": {\"pickle_module_nam' had length 5031, which exceeded length limit of 5000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
