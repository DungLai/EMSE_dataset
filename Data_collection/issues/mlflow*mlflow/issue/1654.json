The reasoning was that mlflow ui was intended only for simple local use-cases and that for anything else one should use mlflow server. That's understood, however in my environment (Cloudera Data Science Workbench) the simple use-case still requires to change host name, otherwise I cannot get to see the UI (that would be running on a different host than the browser I access the \"workbench\" from). \r\n\r\nI'm trying to use mlflow in a very simple way just to track metrics saved in a local directory (or sqllite db), I don't want to spin up a server for that unnecessarily. In order to access mlflow ui running on a CDSW I need to open http server at port `8080` (cf. [Cloudera documentation](https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/latest/topics/cdsw_web_ui.html)) however with host set to `0.0.0.0` . The latter is [hard-coded](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/3861af2c148a4259be969af12211aeb0e8815659/mlflow/cli.py#L198) to 127.0.0.1 in `cli.py` since PR #1267. Altering the hard-code to `0.0.0.0` made me see the UI. \r\n\r\nCould we re-introduce the option of setting up host also with mlflow ui, please? There are \"simple\" (sort of local) use-cases that would still benefit from it. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1654/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
