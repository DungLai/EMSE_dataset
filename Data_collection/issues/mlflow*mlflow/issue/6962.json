Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nCreate a model deployment plugin for [Cortex](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex)\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nSimplifying the integration between MLflow Model Registry and Cortex\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nCortex was recently [acquired](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/04/25/cortex-labs-databricks-model-serving-mlops.html) by Databricks, so it seems likely that more and more MLflow users will consider it for model deployment/serving\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nCortex sounds like it manages spot instances in AWS better than other serving tools, so the cost savings would be beneficial\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, deploying models from the MLflow registry requires `mlflow models serve` (or the equivalent Python API), and this can only be done for environments with supported plugins\r\n\n\n### Details\n\n_No
