I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.28.0\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.5\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nWhen we use set_registered_model_tag() method and the value of the tag is Chinese (or non English), we get the following exception:\r\n\r\n`mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: API request to http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/2.0/preview/mlflow/registered-models/set-tag failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/preview/mlflow/registered-models/set-tag (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses',))`\r\n\r\nOur code snippet for which we get the above exception:\r\n`mlflow_client.set_registered_model_tag(name=model_id, key='name', value='中文菜单')`\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential cause of it:\r\n\r\nThe function `set_registered_model_tag()` method inside `mlflow.store.model_registry.rest_store.RestStore` uses `message_to_json()` method.\r\n\r\nNow `message_to_json()` uses `json.loads()` without setting the encoding scheme as follows:\r\n\r\n` json_dict_with_int64_as_str = json.loads(\r\n        MessageToJson(message, preserving_proto_field_name=True))`\r\n\r\nThis might be the potential reason of why Chinese or non-English strings are failing while setting the values of tags.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Tracking information\n\nMLflow version - 1.28.0\r\nTracking URI: localhost:8000\r\nArtifact URI: Our own aws S3 bucket (private)\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nmlflow_client = MlflowClient()\r\nmlflow_client.set_registered_model_tag(name=model_id, key='name', value='中文菜单')\n\n### Stack trace\n\n`mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: API request to http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/2.0/preview/mlflow/registered-models/set-tag failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/preview/mlflow/registered-models/set-tag (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses',))`\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [X] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [X] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7062/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
