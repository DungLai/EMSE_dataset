Feature requests that are likely to be accepted:**\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to add an `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()` API for automatically logging metrics, params & models generated via scikit-learn.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm personally not particularly familiar with the scikit-learn APIs, so I'd welcome feedback on the proposal below.\r\n\r\n### MVP API Proposal\r\nWe could patch the `BaseEstimator.fit` method to log the params of the model being fit (estimator params are accessible via [`get_params`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html#sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.get_params)) and also log the fitted model itself. \r\n\r\nWe should take care to ensure the UX is reasonable when working with scikit-learn [Pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html), which allow for defining DAGs of estimators. There are a few options here:\r\n1. The sub-estimators simply log nothing (simple to achieve, but may result in too-little logged information).\r\n2. Log params of the sub-estimators comprising a Pipeline under the parent run, but do not log the fitted sub-estimators themselves (log only the enclosing Pipeline model). Note that sub-estimator params can be obtained by passing `deep=True` to `Estimator.get_params`.\r\n3. The sub-estimators comprising a Pipeline & their params are logged under child runs of the parent run\r\n4. The sub-estimators comprising a Pipeline & their params are logged under the parent run (IMO this option is a non-starter, as the parent run could become very polluted with models/params)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Logs information about `pipeline` under the run named \"parent\". In the custom\r\n# patched logic that runs when we call `pipeline.fit()`, we can set an \r\n# `mlflow.sklearn.runContainsPipeline` tag on \"parent\" indicating that it's a run\r\n# containing a Pipeline. As a result, our custom logic for \r\n# fitting our linear regressor knows to create a child run to which to log its \r\n# params (or simply not log anything), by virtue of checking that the\r\n# `mlflow.sklearn.runContainsPipeline` tag is set on the current active run.\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"parent\"):\r\n   pipeline = Pipeline([standard_scaler, linear_regression])\r\n   pipeline.fit(train)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nscikit-learn is a popular ML library, and it'd be a big value-add to make it easy for users to add MLflow tracking to their existing scikit-learn code.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n**For user-facing changes, what APIs are you proposing to add or modify? What code paths will need to be modified?**\r\nSee above - we propose adding a new `mlflow.sklearn.autolog` API\r\n\r\nWe can add the definition of the new `autolog` API in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/sklearn.py, and unit tests under `mlflow/tests/sklearn/test_sklearn_autologging.py`. See this PR: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/1601 as an example of how the same was done for Keras.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2050/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
