Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this documentation issue template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages documentation fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n[Model-customization](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-customization)\r\n[PyFunc-create-custom](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#pyfunc-create-custom)\r\n\r\nPlease provide a link to the documentation entry in question.\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nI am currently trying to log some of our custom models which are comprised of LightGBM models deep down but have other added functionalities as well.\r\nBy now, I am able to log the metrics and parameters manually, but I am having issues with logging artifacts and the models themselves.\r\n\r\nI tried inheriting our models from [PythonModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-customization), but this has three issues:\r\n1. The abstract function `predict` from PythonModel also contains `context` and most of our models already implemented a `predict` function that does not require this additional parameter. \r\n2. One of our models requires additional kwargs, but with the current implementation of `PythonModel` this is not possible as far as I understand it (#2360).\r\n3. I can not use the inherited `PythonModel` for inference before serializing (example below) which is very odd when I just want to extend my model to be able to be logged by MLflow.\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow.pyfunc\r\n\r\n# Define the model class\r\nclass AddN(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, n):\r\n        self.n = n\r\n\r\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\r\n        return model_input.apply(lambda column: column + self.n)\r\n\r\n# Construct and save the model\r\nmodel_path = \"add_n_model\"\r\nadd5_model = AddN(n=5)\r\nmlflow.pyfunc.save_model(path=model_path, python_model=add5_model)\r\n\r\n# Load the model in `python_function` format\r\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_path)\r\n\r\n# Evaluate the model\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nmodel_input = pd.DataFrame([range(10)])\r\n# This works\r\nmodel_output = loaded_model.predict(model_input)\r\n# This does not work as it's missing the context parameter\r\nmodel_output = add5_model(model_input)\r\n\r\nassert model_output.equals(pd.DataFrame([range(5, 15)]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I would extend the documentation by answering the following questions:\r\n1. Am I wrong in assuming that I can just convert my custom model to a `PythonModel` and expect it to work?\r\n2. Is the `PythonModel`-class to be used after my custom-model is trained and I just want to log it? \r\n3. What is the connection between `PyFuncModel` and `PythonModel`?\r\n4. What is the `context` and why do I need it in `PythonModel` and not in `PyFuncModel`?","closed_by":{"login":"HansBambel","id":9060786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjA3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9060786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBambel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
