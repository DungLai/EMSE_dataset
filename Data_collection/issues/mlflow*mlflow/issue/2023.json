This would prevent needing to go to the mlflow store itself to load the run information.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe use case is for viewing the metadata about the current run. This would be valuable for exporting to other services and preventing the need to examine the data store for information that could be in memory.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nRather than returning an empty parameter dict for `ActiveRun.to_dictionary()` populate with the parameters that have been added so far.
