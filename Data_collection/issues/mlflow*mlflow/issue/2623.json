Supporting the docker-py interface instead would allow one to build images on remote docker installations, without having to install docker. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current interface requires the user to install docker on their system, which is not always possible or appropriate. The python API would allow users to build and deploy mlflow models on remote docker installations with simple configuration of their environment. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n\r\nInternal changes only would be required. Backwards compatibility could easily be maintained. \r\n\r\n* Replace the line in [docker_utils](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/383374d7d90bb4494bb34a3e31d3e16e1900078e/mlflow/models/docker_utils.py#L106) with a similar call in [docker-py API](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/images.html)\r\n* Add docker to requirements. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
