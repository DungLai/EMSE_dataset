I have to use `client.search_runs` or `mlflow.search_run` to get experiment run_name, metrics and tags and compare experiments and get a sense of runs within my experiment.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nSame as above, web UI should provide visibility into experiments without hassle but its very to navigate through multiple metrics and tags.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"jyk4100","id":14896560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODk2NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14896560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100","html_url":"https://github.com/jyk4100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyk4100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
