I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No.\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Mac OS X\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.12.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow run .`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow `run` command copies the entire work directory without taking `.dockerignore` and `.gitignore` into account.\r\n\r\nThis opens it up to copying heavy directories like `venv` (virtualenv), secrets, environment variables (.e.g stored in `.env`), etc.\r\n\r\nWhy the Docker env ignores `.dockerignore` is an existing issue #2016.\r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated by adding an `ignore=func` parameter to `shutil.copytree` [used here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/fcf8b90b7c094e6939136fef8a96f3ee1b34d29a/mlflow/projects/docker.py#L109). This would need to implement either `.dockerignore` or .`gitignore` patterns, or implement its own `.mlflowignore` file. This would also make MLFlow run faster because it won't need to copy heavy files around (twice with the `.dockerignore` bug).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nUse any of the example projects. Add any file into the folder and add it to `.dockerignore`. Build the image and note the file being present in the image.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [x] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [x] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3969/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
