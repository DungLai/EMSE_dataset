Param recorded more than once\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case I recorded the features param twice.\r\n\r\nOnce you've recorded a parameter more than once the error persists and the ui becomes unusable. Also, you can't run any new experiments or create runs for existing experiments. It fails always.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nWhen I record my parameters twice, I would expect the value of the parameter to be overwritten with the second value. A warning is fair, but it shouldn't fail. \r\n\r\nI can imagine that not everyone wants the behavior I described above. In that case, raise an error, but don't break the application, because in a production environment that would require someone to manually fix the database. Which is bad.","closed_by":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
