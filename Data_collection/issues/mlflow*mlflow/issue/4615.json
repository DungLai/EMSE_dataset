Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [- ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Mac OS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.18.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: None\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nSo I have created a basic model in the ml pyfunc flavor, which looks something like :\r\n```\r\nclass MyModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\r\n    def __init__(self, n_components=20, random_state=42):\r\n        self.n_components = n_components\r\n        self.random_state = random_state\r\n    \r\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\r\n        n_samples = model_input.shape[0]\r\n        return pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(n_samples)) + self.n_components\r\n```\r\nI then log this model to a tracking server. Now when i try to load this model using üëç \r\n```\r\nmlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)\r\n```\r\nthe model loads in this directory. But when i move out of this directory and run the same command, I get an error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/butter/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py\", line 655, in load_model\r\n    model_impl = importlib.import_module(conf[MAIN])._load_pyfunc(data_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/butter/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/model.py\", line 226, in _load_pyfunc\r\n    python_model = cloudpickle.load(f)\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'models'\r\n```\r\nHowever, If i again log a model from the outside directory and i load again, it starts working. I am not sure if i need to set a directory to cache models somewhere, if i run it from a new directory.\r\n\r\nTl;dr : The same command to load a pyfunc model works in a directory but not in other directories. What are the possible fixes to this.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. log a model to an s3 bucket/locally and then try to load it (it works)\r\n2. Go to the parent directory and try to load the same model with the same uri (throws that error).\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ .] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ .] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nEdit : I'm 90% sure, this has something to do with pickling and unpickling of objects but what is the purpose of storing it in cloud when i need to keep a local copy too somewhere (correct me if i'm wrong tho)","closed_by":{"login":"vibss2397","id":22891797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODkxNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22891797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397","html_url":"https://github.com/vibss2397","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vibss2397/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4615/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
