Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux 5.10.105-1-MANJARO\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.21.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `/bin/sh -c mlflow server --backend-store-uri mysql+pymysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@mlflow_db:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE} --default-artifact-root ${AWS_S3_URL} --host 0.0.0.0` (running in docker; `AWS_S3_URL` points to the S3 where I store the artifacts which worked in the past)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI am running a MLflow (scenario 4) deployment. I have MLflow running behind a reverse proxy with http auth. My setup was working in the past.\r\nRecently, we had to generate need AWS credentials and I updated the environmental variables in my MLflow docker container and restart it (server and mysql db).\r\nMlflow started to store the artifacts in `s3://<bucket-name>/mlflow/<bucket-name>/mlflow/` instead of `s3://<bucket-name>/mlflow/` which is the value of `AWS_S3_URL`.\r\n\r\nWhen viewing a new run, the artifacts load forever and the developer console shows:\r\n`Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: l.children is undefined` in the `ArtifactPageImpl.js:87`.\r\n\r\nI did not change the artifact path for my experiment (left it empty thus defaulting to None). This hasn't been a problem in the past and I have a hard time to debug this scenario.\r\n\r\n**Practically, MLflow is unusable at this point!**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nCannot post the code because my company owns it. I am basically implementing a pytorch model and want to register it in MLflow.\r\n`mlflow.get_artifact_uri()` prints the anticipated artifact Uri.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
