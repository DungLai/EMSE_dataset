This leads to the situation that our URL to remote repository is concatenated by \"conda-forge\" and this causes an error. It seems that JFrog's concept of remote repositories and your settings in reticulate::install_conda collide (as you can see on screenshot below).\r\n<img width=\"1375\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-02-03 at 13 16 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23058806/106908199-614c0e00-66ff-11eb-9376-cdaf6b4eaddb.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we use a custom approach with reticulate::install_conda(..., forge=FALSE, ...) -it is working fine. \r\n\r\nCould you please provide the option to change default parameter \"forge\" of reticulate::install_conda() when using install_mlflow()?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4066/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
