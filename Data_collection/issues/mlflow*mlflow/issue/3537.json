Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe R API should allow for the creation & usage of nested runs similar to how it works in Python.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nNested runs are a crucial feature for organizing complex experimental runs (such as hyper-parameter tuning experiments) within the tracking service. Currently this is not possible in R because the R API does not expose these options as it does in Python.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [X] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [X] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI have no specific thoughts on implementation at this point, except that it should bring the R API up to par with the Python API for creating and managing nested runs. I am happy to work on implementing this with any guidance from existing MLFlow contributors.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tnixon","id":1181780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODE3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1181780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon","html_url":"https://github.com/tnixon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnixon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
