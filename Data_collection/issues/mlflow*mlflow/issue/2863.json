Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS 10.14.6\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.8\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.2\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI have been trying out the MLFlow sample at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example/blob/master/train.py. When I open the Registry UI, it doesn't have the features to request the promotion of a registered model, as stated in the opensource documentation. Generally speaking, it seems to be missing all collaboration features.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nayaks","id":3227883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjc4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3227883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks","html_url":"https://github.com/nayaks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nayaks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
