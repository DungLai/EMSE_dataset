logged.\r\n\r\nIssue: `Run` is created before starting docker container which results in local `artifact_uri` based on your local file system.\r\n\r\n`run_id` is submitted to the docker container through environment variable (`MLFLOW_RUN_ID`), and when using `mlflow.log_artifact`, `artifact_uri` is fetched from the run metadata in `meta.yaml` which as a reference to your local file system and not the one inside the docker container `/mlflow/tmp/mlruns`.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mlflow run . -P alpha=0.4\r\n2019/06/14 10:01:53 INFO mlflow.projects: === Building docker
