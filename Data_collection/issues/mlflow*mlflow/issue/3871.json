Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThere are basic MLflow functionalities such as downloading artifacts that can be performed entirely in R rather than being done through the MLflow Python CLI in a sub process.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nEach time MLflow Python CLI is launched from R, there is a non-trivial overhead for starting up the Python sub process and in many cases running MLflow Python CLI can be avoided entirely.\r\nAlso, the fewer Python dependencies R users need to worry about, the better.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [x] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nDependencies of MLflow R package on MLflow Python CLI should be reduced as much as possible.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yitao-li","id":405346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTM0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/405346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li","html_url":"https://github.com/yitao-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
