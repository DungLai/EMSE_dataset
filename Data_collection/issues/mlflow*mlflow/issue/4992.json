Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this documentation issue template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages documentation fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a link to the documentation entry in question: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_param\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nHi folks, ran into the 250 character limit of `log_param` when I passed the command used to call my script in `sys.argv` to MLflow. For context, MLflow gave me this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Param value '<my-super-long-string>' had length 260, which exceeded length limit of 250\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaven't had the time to trace the source of the character limit, but have a hunch that it depends on the tracking server being used. I ran into this error when using a `sqlite` backend.\r\n\r\nThought it would be worth mentioning in the docs, since exceeding the char limit throws an exception and can interrupt training jobs w/o the user being aware up front. Would like to suggest adding a warning similar to how [log_image](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_image) warns users for values out of range.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4992/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
