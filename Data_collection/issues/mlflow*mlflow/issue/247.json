This would then allow consumers to access the extra options available via the client API of choice (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or Local Storage).\r\n\r\n### Sample Use Case\r\nThere is currently no support for the extra arguments for encryption and other auxillary s3 options (perhaps adding object tagging metadata as well?).\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to have S3 \"default\" a security option in a specific bucket, there are plenty of use cases where that isn't possible (i.e. Bring-Your-Own-Key scenarios).\r\n\r\nPassing the `**kw_args` parameter down the chain of method invocations would allow such behavior to be accessed by consumers of the MLFlow API.","closed_by":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
