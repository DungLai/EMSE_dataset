I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Microsoft Windows 10 Home Version 21H2\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.4\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: see below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCalling mlflow.sklearn.log_model function raises `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object`.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI)\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT)\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\r\nfrom sklearn import tree\r\niris = load_iris()\r\nsk_model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()\r\nsk_model = sk_model.fit(iris.data, iris.target)\r\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(sk_model, str(\"sk_models\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThis seems to be due to `importlib_metadata.version` function, which tries to get the installed version of scikit-learn, but it returns None. I have installed scikit-learn 1.0.2 through `pip install scikit-learn`, and the following code correctly prints 1.0.2:\r\n```\r\nimport sklearn\r\nprint(sklearn.__version__)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5372/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
