Run the script, and allow Conda to manage conda init when asked. This will place the following code in your bash_profile or zshrc:\r\n\r\n# >>> conda initialize >>>\r\n\r\n__conda_setup=\"$('/Users/ankit.mathur/anaconda2/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)\"\r\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\r\n    eval \"$__conda_setup\"\r\nelse\r\n    if [ -f \"/Users/ankit.mathur/anaconda2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" ]; then\r\n        . \"/Users/ankit.mathur/anaconda2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"\r\n    else\r\n        export PATH=\"/Users/ankit.mathur/anaconda2/bin:$PATH\"\r\n    fi\r\nfi\r\nunset __conda_setup\r\n\r\nIt seems that when this happens, it goes through the if block and not the else block, never adding bin to the path. This means that `conda activate` works but `source activate` does not. This means that running the tutorial at: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorial.html breaks when you do `mlflow run` because that generates a new conda environment and tries to switch to it by doing source activate. \r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1507/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
