Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- No custom code\r\n- Databricks Cluster running on AWS c4.2xlarge, Databricks Runtime: 7.3 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12)\r\n- source\r\n- version 1.18.0\r\n- Python 3.7.5\r\n- N/A\r\n- N/A\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen pushing to SageMaker via a Databricks scheduled job the container fails to initialize with the following message:\r\n\r\n```The primary container for production variant testendpoint1-model--oeh3uvttxe4vqzcfyablvg did not pass the ping health check. Please check CloudWatch logs for this endpoint.```\r\n\r\nWhen inspecting the CloudWatch logs one sees the following message\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/opt/mlflow/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py\", line 48, in _init\r\n    _serve()\r\n  File \"/opt/mlflow/mlflow/models/container/__init__.py\", line 63, in _serve\r\n    m = Model.load(model_config_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/mlflow/mlflow/models/__init__.py\", line 60, in load\r\n    return cls(**yaml.safe_load(f.read()))\r\nTypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'databricks_runtime'\r\n```\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Create a notebook that pushes a model to SageMaker\r\n2. Schedule the notebook to run by scheduling a job within Databricks\r\n3. Check CloudWatch logs to see error message.\r\n\r\n```\r\nregion = \"us-west-2\"\r\nlogged_model = 'runs:/' + run_id + '/model'\r\nimage_ecr_url = \"414351767826.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mlflow-pyfunc:1.4.0\"\r\nmfs.deploy(app_name='endpoint_name', model_uri=logged_model, image_url=image_ecr_url, region_name=region, mode=\"replace\")\r\n```\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nI inspected the MLmodel files that were generated. I noticed that there is an additional 'databricks_runtime' that is added to the file which it seems is a keyword arg not compatible with the hosting container. I'm not sure why this databricks_runtime field is being added all of a sudden (perhaps an MLFlow upgrade on our end?). I am pretty sure we have 1.18 MLFlow, and the container is 1.4 -- so this is likely the culprit.\r\n```\r\nartifact_path: model\r\ndatabricks_runtime: 7.3.x-scala2.12\r\nflavors:\r\n  python_function:\r\n    artifacts:\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [X] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
