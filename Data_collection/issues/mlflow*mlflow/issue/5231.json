Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nto have a way to get the model file from GCS by using signed url\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? please refer to the detail section below\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? please refer to the detail section below\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? please refer to the detail section below \r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? please refer to the detail section below \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nlet's take a look at the current deployment view of the model development flow with MLFlow.\r\n![mlflow-deployment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32842826/148482528-af6b0a35-1769-4532-adfb-08a8bda369c6.png)\r\nthe picture above shows the high-level of system deployment view while ignoring several detailed components such as relational databases. Here are several important points which are related to this:\r\n- In this context, each model service components are a completely different service. They aren't replicas.\r\n- The VPC in yellow are the user artefacts, while the purple ones are managed by the our team.\r\n- MLFlow service is exposed through a public API that is only accessible by other internal services. We use openresty as the proxy.\r\n- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) doesn't lie inside the VPC. It's accessible through the internet. But, it's protected by a perimeter.\r\n\r\nNext, let's zoom into the main use case of this system, which is to fetch models from the MLFlow service.\r\n![mlflow-deployment (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32842826/148485032-145eca4d-c719-4adf-ace9-2a3d210b1d5e.png)\r\nthe picture above shows the flow of the main use case of this system. The flow happens sequentially, but each request can be parallelized. Here is the detail of the flow:\r\n1.  MLFlow returns the GCS URL of the model, not the model itself.\r\n2.  Next, the model service requests the file to the GCS.\r\n3. GCS returns the requested files.\r\n\r\nyou can see the problem lies when the users need to get the model file directly to GCS. they can't do that due to the perimeter.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
