Willingness to contribute\n\nNo. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nThe 'Compare Runs' page shows all parameters logged for the runs being compared.\r\nIt would be much more convenient if one could filter only those parameters that are different for the given runs or if they were highlighted.\n\n### Motivation\n\n#### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nThere is too much noise in the run comparison interface\r\n\r\n#### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n#### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n#### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nOne can only find differentiating parameters for the compared runs by visually looking through all of them (and there may be a few dozen * a lot of runs)\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model

Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ]
