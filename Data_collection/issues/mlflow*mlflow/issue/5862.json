I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nUpdate pyspark.ml.autolog's behavior to accept log_model_allowlist file that's stored in storage like S3 or Azure blob storage. \n\n### Motivation\n\n#### What is the use case for this feature?\r\nLet pyspark.ml.autolog accept log_model_allowlist file from most storage including S3, Azure blob storage, etc.\r\n\r\n#### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nTake databricks for example, we need to set cluster spark configuration of `spark.mlflow.pysparkml.autolog.logModelAllowlistFile` to point to the file, and if we support reading from whatever storage then this config can accept link to files stored outside of dbfs.\r\n\r\n#### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nMake the updating log_model_allowlist file process easier, and for specific libraries we can provide a default link that users could point to without downloading & uploading themselves.\r\n\r\n#### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nCurrently pyspark.ml.autolog is reading log_model_allowlist file using python's `open` function, which only supports reading files from local disk. This behavior makes updating log_model_allowlist file a bit complicated. \n\n### Details\n\n1. Within the source code we're reading the file using python's built-in `open` method to read the log_model_allowlist file, one option would be that we replace this `open` with `smart_open.open()`. This `smart_open` library supports reading files from lots of storages (https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open) But this need mlflow to depend on smart_open library.\r\n2. We check the format of the config link, and it should be a public-accessible link that we don't need extra confidential to download, then if it's a downloadable link we can download the file and read it.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
