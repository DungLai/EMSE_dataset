Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: \r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:  1.10.1.dev0\r\n- **Python version**:  sys.version_info(major=3, minor=8, micro=5, releaselevel='final', serial=0\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\n`mlflow.pyfunc.scoring_server.parse_json_input` not convert column dtype as input schema types if column name is conform to pandas datelike column names,  and evently raise `TypeError: Cannot interpret 'StringDtype' as a data type` in `_enforce_type` line 313. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nparse input data contains datelike columns, check their\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport json\r\nimport \r\n\r\n\r\nraw_data = json.dumps({\r\n    \"columns\": [\"code_id\", \"start_time\", \"end_time\"],\r\n    \"data\": [[\"130302198704131813\", \"2020-08-01\", \"2020-08-05\"]]\r\n})\r\ndata = parse_json_input(raw_data, orient='split', schema=schema)\r\n\r\nprint(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis get  \r\n\r\n```\r\ncode_id               object\r\nstart_time    datetime64[ns]\r\nend_time      datetime64[ns]\r\ndtype: object\r\n\r\n```\r\nthen,  in  `_enforce_schema`  call \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import _enforce_schema\r\n\r\n_enforce_schema(data, schema)\r\n\r\n```\r\nraise \r\n\r\n```ipython\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-8-56d218bd9656> in <module>\r\n      1 from mlflow.pyfunc import _enforce_schema\r\n      2 \r\n----> 3 _enforce_schema(data, schema)\r\n\r\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py in _enforce_schema(pdf, input_schema)\r\n    383     new_pdf = pandas.DataFrame()\r\n    384     for i, x in enumerate(col_names):\r\n--> 385         new_pdf[x] = _enforce_type(x, pdf[x], col_types[i])\r\n    386     return new_pdf\r\n    387 \r\n\r\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py in _enforce_type(name, values, t)\r\n    311             )\r\n    312 \r\n--> 313     if values.dtype in (t.to_pandas(), t.to_numpy()):\r\n    314         # The types are already compatible => conversion is not necessary.\r\n    315         return values\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot interpret 'StringDtype' as a data type\r\n```\r\n\r\nmore seriously, datetime type not contains in mlflow `DataType` range. this will bypass lots'  datatype sanity check \r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
