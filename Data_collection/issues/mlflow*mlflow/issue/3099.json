like we might be missing support for custom pre/post-processing for R models.\r\n\r\nFrom public Slack group:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNew to ML Flow here and I'm wondering how pre-processing/post-processing of inputs/outputs can be achieved for an ML flow deployed model. I have Tensorflow model I'm trying to deploy and I used the Tensorflow flavor to create the ML Flow model for it. For context, this model will be deployed for business users to test by sending inputs to an API. The actual model input is an array of token_ids from documents. But business users would provide english text to the API. So I'll need to somehow pre-process the input text by the users to suitable model input of token_ids and then serve the array to the model API. Also, the model output is a list of probabilities for ~60 classes. How do I pre-process and post-process the model inputs/result so business users can simply submit text to the API and get in return the appropriate mapped class the model provides. Is this possible?\r\n\r\nDo you  have some example with R?\r\n\r\nI don't think the R models have the same support to add custom pre/post-processing.\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3099/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
