Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: y\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: 18.04 Docker\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.80\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: Run any docker mlflow example\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nIn my Docker container I am switching the user from root to a new user called 'user'. However, MLFlow creates all folders inside the Docker container as 'root'. Hence, I run into issues like:\r\n```\r\nGPU Run Time: 62.669366121292114 seconds\r\nLogging model to mlflow...\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mnist_pytorch.py\", line 188, in <module>\r\n    start_training()\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 829, in __call__\r\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 782, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1066, in invoke\r\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 610, in invoke\r\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"mnist_pytorch.py\", line 175, in start_training\r\n    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, 'models')\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py\", line 158, in log_model\r\n    registered_model_name=registered_model_name, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/models/__init__.py\", line 102, in log\r\n    mlflow.tracking.fluent.log_artifacts(local_path, artifact_path)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\", line 323, in log_artifacts\r\n    MlflowClient().log_artifacts(run_id, local_dir, artifact_path)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 267, in log_artifacts\r\n    self._tracking_client.log_artifacts(run_id, local_dir, artifact_path)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 268, in log_artifacts\r\n    artifact_repo.log_artifacts(local_dir, artifact_path)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact/local_artifact_repo.py\", line 50, in log_artifacts\r\n    mkdir(artifact_dir)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/file_utils.py\", line 110, in mkdir\r\n    raise e\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/utils/file_utils.py\", line 107, in mkdir\r\n    os.makedirs(target)\r\n  File \"/home/user/miniconda/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.7/os.py\", line 223, in makedirs\r\n    mkdir(name, mode)\r\nPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/zeth/PycharmProjects/mlflow_pytorch/mlruns/0/fb257ba0821147898df402a23ee214c1/artifacts/models'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when running `ls -la`:\r\n```\r\n(pytorch) user@3aabccf058b8:/mlflow/projects/code/mlruns/0/fb257ba0821147898df402a23ee214c1$ ls -la\r\ntotal 32\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 .\r\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 ..\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 artifacts\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  396 Jan  1  1970 meta.yaml\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 metrics\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 params\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 tags\r\n```\r\nI can see that everything is owned by root. \r\nHowever, to my mind everything should be created and owned by the current user!\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround for this? I already made a workaround for the models subdirectory, where I just run chmod -R 777 /mlflowruns , however, this does not work for the artifacts, since this whole directory is created at runtime at the single code line.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nAny Docker example should suffice.
