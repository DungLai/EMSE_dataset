Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address.\r\n  \r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n## Guidelines\r\n\r\nFeature requests typically go through the following lifecycle:\r\n\r\n1. Submit feature request with high-level description on GitHub issues (this is what you're doing now)\r\n2. Discuss feature request with a committer, who may ask for a more detailed design\r\n3. After discussion & agreement on feature request, start implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe the proposal\r\nAs a data scientist, I want to create pivot tables to compare models. I want to aggregate by specific parameters, tasks or tags and display metrics.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThis provides an individual configuration option for different aggregations of the model data. The comparison of runs by model classes, datasets or tasks can be done flexibly. This enables easier and efficient operation.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
