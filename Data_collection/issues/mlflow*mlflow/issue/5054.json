Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu18.04, Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: MLflow R SDK from https://cloud.r-project.org/\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: NA\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nIn R MLflow SDK as a part of mlflow_log_model api call [timestamp](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/d6ae84164987e2881cdffdce07f7dcf0e3d94aaa/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model.R#L57) generated to capture model creation time, is an invalid timestamp string.\r\n \r\nA sample timestamp string generated is **21-11-11T21:49:25.25.46**. This string cannot be parsed by C# [DateTime.Parse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.parse?view=net-5.0#System_DateTime_Parse_System_String_) and throws following error **[System.FormatException: String was not recognized as a valid DateTime**\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Run following R code in R Studio to generate a timestamp as generated to [mlflow_log_model ](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/d6ae84164987e2881cdffdce07f7dcf0e3d94aaa/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model.R#L30)API\r\n```R\r\nmlflow_timestamp <- function() {\r\n  withr::with_options(\r\n    c(digits.secs = 2),\r\n    format(\r\n      as.POSIXlt(Sys.time(), tz = \"GMT\"),\r\n      \"%y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%OS\"\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nmlflow_timestamp ()\r\n```\r\n2. Copy the timestamp string generated in step 1 and run following C# code\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\npublic class Program\r\n{\r\n\tpublic static void Main()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t//Corrected Date Format in string\r\n\t\t \t\tstring test = \"21-11-11T21:49:25.25.46\";\r\n\t\t\t\t//Convert the string date value to datetime \r\n                DateTime DT = DateTime.Parse(test);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t \tConsole.WriteLine(\"Value in datetime format : \" + DT);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will result in following error: \r\n```csharp\r\nStack Trace:\r\n\r\n[System.FormatException: String was not recognized as a valid DateTime.]\r\n   at System.DateTimeParse.Parse(String s, DateTimeFormatInfo dtfi, DateTimeStyles styles)\r\n   at System.DateTime.Parse(String s)\r\n   at Program.Main() :line 10\r\n```\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
