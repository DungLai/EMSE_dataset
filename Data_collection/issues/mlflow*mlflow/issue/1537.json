It actually takes slightly longer than 60 seconds to load these models, but according to: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/pyfunc/backend.py\r\nThe gunicorn timeout parameter is locked in at 60 seconds and I cannot override this using `GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS` because this timeout is locked in. \r\n\r\nThis causes the \"scoring_server\" to timeout and restart prematurely and there is currently no way to increase the timeout.\r\n\r\nThe user should have the option to override this timeout from environment variables, or as a command line argument for `mlflow models serve`.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"LarsDu","id":17152264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTUyMjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17152264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu","html_url":"https://github.com/LarsDu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsDu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
