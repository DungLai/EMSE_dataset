Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in MLflow or a feature request.\r\nMLflow tries to insert a default experiment with experiment_id 0 into the experiments table in _create_default_experiment method in sqlalchemy_store.py. However, experiment_id is a primary key and SQL Server database rejects it.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6925089/60488528-0ca8fd00-9c57-11e9-9326-8dbfae832c64.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
