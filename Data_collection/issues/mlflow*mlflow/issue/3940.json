Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing in the UI an experiment with many runs that have models (with files stored on HDFS), the UI becomes very slow. It takes a lot of time to load model informations and display the links (~10 seconds), and scrolling down to see the all the runs is very laggy.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nCreate an experiment with 200 runs that have models stored on HDFS, and access this experiment in the UI.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3940/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3940/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
