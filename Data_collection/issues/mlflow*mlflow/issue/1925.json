But there are two tags which are set manually, it would be helpful for us if there was some kind of option to trigger a REST call or a message/mail to highlight the change.\r\nCould be also beneficial for monitoring manual changes and controlling accidents.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nAs I'm no expert on the field I thought about some kind of WebHook that sends a POST to a predefined location.
