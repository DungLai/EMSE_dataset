Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.14.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe experiments page is not displaying tags that contain dot (.) character in them. Browser console shows this error:\r\n`Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'model' of undefined\r\n    at Reducers.js:319\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at artifactsByRunUuid (Reducers.js:318)\r\n    at combineReducers.js:129\r\n    at combineReducers.js:129\r\n    at v (createStore.js:166)\r\n    at index.js:114\r\n    at index.js:11\r\n    at dispatch (applyMiddleware.js:46)\r\n    at index.js:202`\r\n\r\nfor eg, try with the tag key `mlflow.gitRepoURL` and value as `https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example.git`.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the dot character tag gets displayed correctly in the UI.\r\n\r\nI tried with MySql and Postgres as backend stores. With MySql, its slightly better as experiments page appears with only tags hidden. However, with Postgres the experiment page itself will fail to load.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nI simply ran stock example:\r\n`mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=5.0`\r\nthat adds some tags such as mlflow.gitRepoURL, mlflow.project.backend etc, none of them are getting rendered in the UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThere are no errors in the mlflow service. Browser console has error that I put above. Seems like only UI bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
