Can this be  made much simpler by having API's similar to `get_artifact_uri`. It took  me a while to figure out this as the way to access the `run_uuid`.\r\n\r\nI currently use the `run_uuid`  for appending it to the model that is built, this actually helps later to go back to the experiment where the model was built.
