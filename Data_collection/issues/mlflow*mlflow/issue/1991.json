This function needs a parameter with a pre-defined default folder (mind the write permissions), just like `log_model()`, where client-side `/tmp` folder is used for that purpose behing the scenes. The current behavior of log_model() is arguably worse, because even if a default is there, the model files get quickly deleted from the temporary location on the client side. So an accompanying `keep_local_copy=False` parameter is also needed to prevent such unwanted file deletions from temporary location.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
