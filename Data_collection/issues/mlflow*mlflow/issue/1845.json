If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue has been reported many times in the past. In my case, this error occurs when I install mlflow from source code, but it works if mlflow is installed from pip install. After I investigated the issue, I found that the code uses `server/js/build` as the static folder, which is a valid path in the pip version, but missing from the source code. \r\n\r\nCan someone help me understand whether this is a bug, why the `server/js/build` is missing from the source code.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
