Already had a tracking server running in a filebased tracking system and wanted to get the registry going aswell, so trying to use a mysql db. \r\nThe question is: is there a way to maintain the tracking of the experiments on both servers? (save the mlflow entities on both file:// and mysql:// servers, so that if the DB goes down, the user can continue it's experiments/tracking on the file based, without any historic info lost).\r\nFrom what I tried, i'm only being able to track on the DB server or on the filebased server.
