For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Custom\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.14.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI am using a Scikit-Learn wrapper for XGBoost (XGBRegressor).\r\n\r\nNow when logging the model with mlflow (mlflow.xgboost.log_model), it crashes as anticipated by the official documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.xgboost.html\r\n\r\nI noticed that if I use mlflow.sklearn.log_model instead, the artifact gets saved as expected.\r\n\r\n1. What are the implications of using mlflow.sklearn.log_model with an XGBoost model? Not clear to me.\r\n2. What alternatives do I have to log my XGBRegressor model correctly with mlflow?\r\n\r\nObviously if I instead use a RandomForest, then mlflow.sklearn.log_model works perfectly as expected, so again my issue is to log the XGBRegressor model.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nmlflow.xgboost.log_model(pipeline, \"model\") (where pipeline combines transformers and the XGBRegressor)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n    151\r\n    152     # Save an XGBoost model\r\n--> 153     xgb_model.save_model(model_data_path)\r\n    154\r\n    155     conda_env_subpath = \"conda.yaml\"\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'Pipeline' object has no attribute 'save_model'\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
