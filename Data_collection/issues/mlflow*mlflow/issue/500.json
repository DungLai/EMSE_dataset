[Here is an example usage of training a SpaCy text classification model.](https://spacy.io/usage/training#textcat)\r\n\r\nThe two relevant functions for creating the module would be `nlp = spacy.load(model_path)` and `nlp.to_disk(output_path)`. To make a prediction, you would run something like `nlp(\"Here is some example text to classify\").cats['CATEGORY']`.\r\n\r\nI think this should be easy to implement?
