Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n-   [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n-   [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n-   [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to add support for tensorflow model versions so it's compatible with TF-serving. \r\n\r\nTF-serving expects the following structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- tensorflow model\r\n|       -- 1\r\n|       |-- saved_model.pb\r\n|       -- variables\r\n|           |-- variables.data-00000-of-00001\r\n|           -- variables.index\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd an argument `model_version` to `mlflow.tensorflow.log_model` so the resulting model is saved under `model_version` folder and not the default `tfmodel`\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\nadd an option to not save the model under `tfmodel` folder by default:\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/4f4f002d19f5f7e29d1717a6a8c833a383a761da/mlflow/tensorflow.py#L269\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/4f4f002d19f5f7e29d1717a6a8c833a383a761da/mlflow/tensorflow.py#L270\r\nand then the model could be saved as:\r\n```\r\nmodel_dir = 'project_name/1'\r\ntf.saved_model.save(model, model_dir)\r\nmlflow.tensorflow.log_model(tf_saved_model_dir=model_dir,        \r\n                                                tf_signature_def_key=\"serving_default\", \r\n                                                tf_meta_graph_tags=\"serve\",     \r\n                                                artifact_path=model_dir)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n-   What is the use case for this feature?\r\n    -   Use TF-serving to serve models logged in MLflow\r\n-   Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n    -   Tensorflow serving is widely used way of model serving and it would be nice to support it\r\n-   Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n    -  We use tensorflow serving to serve models in production. We also use MLflow to track experiments and log models.  We would like to pass the path to an S3 storage where models are logged to TF-serving  \r\n-   Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\n\r\nComponents\r\n\r\n-   [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n-   [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n-   [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n-   [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n-   [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n-   [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n-   [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n-   [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n-   [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n-   [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n\r\n-   [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n-   [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n-   [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n-   [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages\r\n\r\n-   [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n-   [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n-   [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n\r\n-   [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n-   [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n-   [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIf I log a tensorflow model with tensorflow like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel_dir = 'project_name/1'\r\ntf.saved_model.save(model, model_dir)\r\nmlflow.tensorflow.log_model(tf_saved_model_dir=model_dir,      \r\n                                                tf_signature_def_key=\"serving_default\",                                  \r\n                                                tf_meta_graph_tags=\"serve\",     \r\n                                                artifact_path=model_dir)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting structure in MLflow is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|-- project_name\r\n|   -- 1\r\n|   -- tfmodel\r\n|         | -- saved_model.pb|         \r\n            | -- variables|             \r\n            | -- variables.data-00000-of-00001              \r\n            | -- variables.index              \r\n            | --variables\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we try to load the model to tensorflow serving docker there is the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading servable: {name: project_name version: 1} failed: Not found: Specified file path does not appear to contain a SavedModel bundle (should have a file called `saved_model.pb`)\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4166/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
