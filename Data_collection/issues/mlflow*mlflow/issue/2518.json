The proposal is to display these tags in the ui, perhaps in the header near the experiment name, id, and notes.  \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIf using experiment tags to organize experiments, being able to view these easily in the ui would facilitate a better workflow.  For example, if an experiment is run with a particular data version or model version and tagged with this data, it would be useful to see it in the ui.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nI am unsure on implementation details, but believe the APIs exist to allow incorporating this on the frontend.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2518/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2518/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
