Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip install\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow-1.7.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: No\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: Can not be reproduce\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI setup mlflow server with nginx as it proxy. In nginx I just modify the proxy_pass in location / to meet our gunicorn host.  When the client keep sending mlflow.log_param, mlflow.log_metric to mlflow-server. The following exceptions has been raised:\r\n```\r\nrequests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host=<host_ip>, port=<port>): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/get-by-name?experiment_name=<exp_name> (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x1280a8438>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 60] Operation timed out',))\r\n```\r\nFull error message can be found in this [stackoverflow post]:(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60680528/max-retries-exceeded-with-url-failed-to-establish-a-new-connect-errno-60-oper)\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nThis issue can not be reproduced currently. In the client, we use pytorch as our training framework and the size of our batch data will larger than 1GB which means it takes the client much time to handle each training step. However, we only `log_param(experiment hyperparameters)` and `log_metric` in the client code.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nCurrently not found, I will contact the clients whether it's possible to share their program","closed_by":{"login":"JIElite","id":6872274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzIyNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6872274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite","html_url":"https://github.com/JIElite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JIElite/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
