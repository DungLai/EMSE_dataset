Another use case is when training process takes significant time, users may want to see the progress on MLFlow UI.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4522842/68992067-efc03f80-086e-11ea-8fe7-0819b4c96858.png)\r\n\r\nAPI which would return path to logs and/or tail logs itself while running training.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2106/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
