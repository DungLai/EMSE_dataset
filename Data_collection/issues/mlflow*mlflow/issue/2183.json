enable we should make the number of runs that appear per \"page\" load configurable, so that users can view more than 100 runs at a time without clicking \"load more\" a bunch of times. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nSee above - we should make the number of runs that appear per \"page\" load configurable, so that users can view more than 100 runs at a time without clicking \"load more\" a bunch of times\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nTo implement this proposal, we can expose the [max_results SearchRuns API parameter](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/23df0e111a9802181d4e0ea1e85934805514e3d0/mlflow/protos/service.proto#L926) via the search UI rendered by [ExperimentView](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/components/ExperimentView.js#L364) & likely updating logic [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/23df0e111a9802181d4e0ea1e85934805514e3d0/mlflow/server/js/src/components/ExperimentPage.js#L145) &

We should also add unit tests [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/23df0e111a9802181d4e0ea1e85934805514e3d0/mlflow/server/js/src/components/ExperimentPage.test.js#L173)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
