This is because `mlflow_client_download_artifacts()` uses `mlflow_cli()` to execute artifact download.  Unfortunately `mlflow_cli()` assumes that the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable is set to the correct tracking uri and does not use the tracking uri within the `mlflow_client` object passed to `mlflow_client_download_artifacts()`\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n```\r\nmlflow_client_download_artifacts <- function(client, run_id, path) {\r\n  result <- mlflow_cli(\r\n    \"artifacts\", \"download\",\r\n    \"--run-id\", run_id,\r\n    \"--artifact-path\", path,\r\n    echo = FALSE,\r\n    stderr_callback = function(x, p) {\r\n      if (grepl(\"FileNotFoundError\", x))\r\n        stop(\r\n          gsub(\"(.|\\n)*(?=FileNotFoundError)\", \"\", x, perl = TRUE),\r\n          call. = FALSE\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  gsub(\"\\n\", \"\", result$stdout)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `client` object is not even used inside of the function\r\n```\r\nmlflow_cli <- function(..., background = FALSE, echo = TRUE, stderr_callback = NULL) {\r\n  args <- list(...)\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n  env <- list(\r\n    PATH = paste(Sys.getenv(\"PATH\"), python, sep = \":\"),\r\n    MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME = python_conda_home(),                      # devel version\r\n    MLFLOW_MLFLOW_CONDA = file.path(python_conda_bin(), \"conda\"), # pip version (deprecated)\r\n    MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI = mlflow_get_tracking_uri()\r\n  )\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nmlflow_get_tracking_uri <- function() {\r\n  .globals$tracking_uri %||% {\r\n    env_uri <- Sys.getenv(\"MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI\")\r\n    if (nchar(env_uri)) env_uri else fs::path_abs(\"mlruns\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I set the environment variable to the correct tracking URI, then `mlflow_client_download_artifacts()` works as intended.'\r\n```\r\nSys.setenv(\"MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI\" = MLFLOW_URI)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\nSet the environment variable of `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` to the tracking URI of the `mlflow_client` object passed to the `mlflow_client_download_artifacts()` function before calling `mlflow_cli()`.","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/918/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
