Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**:3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe entry point of the project is executed via `mlfow run`  using the Docker container environment. On each instance of the execution, mlflow is using the base image provided in MLproject file to create new docker image, and this process is taking significant amount of time.\r\n\r\nOne possible reason for the problem is the size of directory where `mlproject run` is executed (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2016). Even if the #2016 bug is fixed, the project has the data dependency and other artifacts which can grow immensely in size and consequently cause lot more time in building the docker container environment.\r\n\r\nHere is the size of docker container image and base image:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"620\" alt=\"docker images\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/689777/104094780-01597780-52b9-11eb-8fa6-d95c5312824c.png\">\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ x] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
