This is crucial since the production deployment system works efficiently on models saved as torchscript models (using `torch.jit.save`)\r\nThis is not possible to achieve with the current `pytorch.save_model` since we use `torch.save` internally. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nI have two proposals in mind after talking to @mateiz in slack\r\n\r\n1. Use the existing `pytorch.save_model` itself with an argument user can control to tell mlflow that whether it's a torchscript model or a `torch.nn.Module` model (or we can check the type of the incoming model and decide which flavor but explicit is better than implicit, I guess). The only constraint here is the same `pytorch` file will now have to save two flavors -> `pytorch` or `torchscript`. This sort of doesn't follow the MLFlow API design where every flavor gets one `save`, `load` and `log` function. \r\n2. Use another flavor and call it as `torchscript` and make a module for that. The API here becomes `mlflow.torchscript`\r\n\r\nI have coded up a draft form of the second approach [here](https://github.com/hhsecond/mlflow-redisai/blob/master/mlflow_redisai/torchscript.py) but looking for suggestions before I make a PR for this to mlflow\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2263/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
