On checking a run's `meta.yaml`, found that `artifact_uri`, `source_name` are absolute paths which are no longer valid on the latter / destination machine.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n- On Machine 1:\r\n  - goto `cd ~/` folder\r\n  - track some work using mlflow.tracking API\r\n  - check in the mlruns folder into a version control\r\n- On Machine 2:\r\n  - goto `cd ~/Desktop`, different than the one used in Machine 1\r\n  - Clone the above repo created on Machine 1\r\n  - Run `mlflow ui` in the project folder where `mlruns` folder exists\r\n  - goto http://127.0.0.1:5000/experiments/2, i.e. to the corresponding experiment to see 500 errors and folder not found exceptions in the mflow server logs\r\n\r\nNote: The above can be easily replicated on a single machine by cloning `mlruns` folder\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\nThere might be a reason why the mlflow devs might have chosen to use absolute paths in the `meta.yaml` file. However having the ability to be able to easily share mlruns folder could be quite helpful. A simpler way for starters could be by storing relative paths from the nearest ancestor `.git` folder.","closed_by":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
