Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ x ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsample = {\r\n    'Type': 'Cat',\r\n    'Age': 3\r\n}\r\n\r\ninput_dict = {name: tf.convert_to_tensor([value]) for name, value in sample.items()}\r\nmodel = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(...)\r\npredictions = model.predict(input_dict)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn MLFlow this will throw error:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Expected input to be DataFrame or list. Found: dict\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nMLFlow only allows the use of dataframe or lists for prediction, but not a dict - which is the recommended way to predict of Tensorflow modles with feature columns. (see https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/preprocessing_layers#inference_on_new_data)\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nBuild a Tensorflow v2 model with feature columns and then try to use it for prediction via MLFlow, see https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/preprocessing_layers#inference_on_new_data\r\n\r\n```\r\nsample = {\r\n    'Type': 'Cat',\r\n    'Age': 3\r\n}\r\n\r\ninput_dict = {name: tf.convert_to_tensor([value]) for name, value in sample.items()}\r\nmodel = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(...)\r\npredictions = model.predict(input_dict)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn MLFlow this will throw error:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Expected input to be DataFrame or list. Found: dict\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
