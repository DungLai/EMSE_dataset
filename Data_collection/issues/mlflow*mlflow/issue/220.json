However it is very hard to effectively serve gunicorn-backed servers behind an AWS ELB, as evidenced mostly in this issue: https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/1194. Besides directly deploying on EC2, one way to circumvent this issue would be to make `gevent` workers available. There would be mostly, two additions: \r\n\r\n* a new optional parameter to the CLI `mlflow server`, which could something on the lines of `mlflow server -k [gevent|gunicorn]`, defaulting to gunicorn;\r\n* pass the option along, which would trigger a call of something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexec_cmd([\"gunicorn\", \"-k\", worker_type, \"-b\", bind_address, \"-w\", \"%s\" % workers, \"mlflow.server:app\"]\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nI was able to quickly test this enhancement by hardcoding the worker type to the gunicorn call to test if it would correctly respond to the requests -- server starts up successfully and it is able to handle requests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2018-07-31 10:59:08 +0000] [12073] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0\r\n[2018-07-31 10:59:08 +0000] [12073] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5000 (12073)\r\n[2018-07-31 10:59:08 +0000] [12073] [INFO] Using worker: gevent\r\n[2018-07-31 10:59:08 +0000] [12077] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 12077\r\n[2018-07-31 10:59:08 +0000] [12078] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 12078\r\n[2018-07-31 10:59:08 +0000] [12079] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 12079\r\n[2018-07-31 10:59:09 +0000] [12086] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 12086\r\n```\r\nI'd be glad to help with a PR, wanted to double check if it makes sense at the first place.","closed_by":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
