Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow startup fails with the following error when using a DB URL that looks like: `postgres://...`\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.tracking.registry.UnsupportedModelRegistryStoreURIException:  Model registry functionality is unavailable; got unsupported URI 'postgres://<<host and password and stuff>>' for model registry data storage. Supported URI schemes are: ['', 'file', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite', 'mssql']. See https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#storage for how to run an MLflow server against one of the supported backend storage locations.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a known issue or not. Admittedly, I'm also not sure if this is _actually_ an MLFlow issue, or if it's a SQLAlchemy issue. It seems like it should be easy enough to allow Postgres DBs to be specified with either `postgres` or `postgresql`? Is there a reason this isn't the case by default? It's annoying because some platforms (e.g. Heroku + Heroku Postgres) automatically add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the app running MLFlow when the database is configured. But this `DATABASE_URL` uses `postgres` and not `postgresql`, which means that I essentially need to copy the URL but change `postgres` --> `postgresql` in order to get MLFlow to start. This seems like unnecessary overhead to me.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for any help on this!","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
