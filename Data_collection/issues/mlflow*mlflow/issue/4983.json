Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows Server 2019\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.3\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.13\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow_transition_model_version_stage(name, version, stage = \"Production\", archive_existing_versions = TRUE)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nmlflow_rest function fails in requests with boolean variables. This is caused by the use of rapply(data, as.character, how = \"replace\"), which quotes the boolean variables, replacing them as characters. \r\n\r\nThis can easily be fixed by adding the argument 'classes = c(\"numeric\", \"character\")' to the rapply statement. This excludes boolean variables from being converted.\r\n\r\nAn example is when using the mlflow_transition_model_version_stage() function with the archive_existing_versions argument. \r\nThis function throws the error:\r\n \"Error: API request to endpoint 'model-versions/transition-stage' failed with error code 500. Reponse body: '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\r\n<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>\r\n<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>\r\n<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.</p>\r\n' \"\r\n\r\nFor now it can be circumvented in R by calling the REST API directly without the 'rapply' wrapper.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\nmlflow_transition_model_version_stage(name, version, stage = \"Production\", archive_existing_versions = TRUE)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n Error: API request to endpoint 'model-versions/transition-stage' failed with error code 500.
