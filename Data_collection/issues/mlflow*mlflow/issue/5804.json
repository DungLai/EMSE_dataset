Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this documentation issue template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages documentation fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://mlflow.org/docs/latest/_modules/mlflow/tracking/fluent.html#set_experiment\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nProvide a clear description. Why is the proposed documentation better?\r\n\r\nChange documentation / code example from \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n# Set an experiment name, which must be unique and case sensitive.\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"Social NLP Experiments\")\r\n# Get Experiment Details\r\nexperiment = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(\"Social NLP Experiments\")\r\nprint(\"Experiment_id: {}\".format(experiment.experiment_id))\r\nprint(\"Artifact Location: {}\".format(experiment.artifact_location))\r\nprint(\"Tags: {}\".format(experiment.tags))\r\nprint(\"Lifecycle_stage: {}\".format(experiment.lifecycle_stage))\r\n```\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n# Set an experiment name, which must be unique and case sensitive.\r\nexperiment = mlflow.set_experiment(\"Social NLP Experiments\")\r\n# Get Experiment Details\r\nprint(\"Experiment_id: {}\".format(experiment.experiment_id))\r\nprint(\"Artifact Location: {}\".format(experiment.artifact_location))\r\nprint(\"Tags: {}\".format(experiment.tags))\r\nprint(\"Lifecycle_stage: {}\".format(experiment.lifecycle_stage))\r\n```\r\nAs the mlflow.set_experiment returns an instance of [mlflow.entities.Experiment](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.entities.html#mlflow.entities.Experiment) representing the new active experiment, there is no need to use ```mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(...)``` in addition within the code example.","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
