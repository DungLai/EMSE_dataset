Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nBeing able to select some experiments, and open a compare. Then select other experiments, and open a compare. Currently, have to click 'back', redo the search, and then can reselect. Cannot currently reuse the same search to compare multiple sets of experiments\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nSaves time. Convenient. Same reasons we want to use mlflow in the first place :)\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nOften need to compare multiple sets of experiments. Very tedious to have to redo the search query from scratch multiple times. Or copy and paste the search query, etc.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nclicking on 'compare' overwrites the current window. no way to launch the compare in a new tab.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here.
