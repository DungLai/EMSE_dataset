Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux RHEL 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.7.2, also in current version\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe following code blocks:\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/a46bb1f3f69940768e1f6b5e583f99703bd4dfeb/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py#L22-L24\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/a46bb1f3f69940768e1f6b5e583f99703bd4dfeb/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py#L157-L184\r\nwill encounter: `ArrowIOError: HDFS list directory failed, errno: 255 (Unknown error 255) Please check that you are connecting to the correct HDFS RPC port`\r\nwith java backend error: `UnknownHostException: java.net.UnknownHostException: Invalid host name: local host is: (unknown); destination host is: \"myhdfs-ns\":8020; java.net.UnknownHostException; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/UnknownHost`\r\nwhen we use `--default-artifact-root hdfs://MyHDFS-ns/mlflow_artifacts`.\r\nIn our hadoop dfs.nameservices set to MyHDFS-ns in $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml. Urllib converts name service (from --default-artifact-root) to lowercase (myhdfs-ns). After it pyarrow can't connect to hdfs correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nYou need hadoop with dfs.nameservices with Uppercase as in our case.\r\nStart mlflow server with  key `--default-artifact-root hdfs://{dfs.nameservices}/mlflow_artifacts` and try to read, write or list artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nWe found 2 WA for this bug.\r\n1) With our hadoop and pyarrow==0.15.1 we comment host, port, user and driver variables: \r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/a46bb1f3f69940768e1f6b5e583f99703bd4dfeb/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py#L172-L175\r\n\r\n2) We corrupt our $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml with lowercase dfs.nameservices.\r\n\r\nBoth wa is wrong way to fix this bug.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4909/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
