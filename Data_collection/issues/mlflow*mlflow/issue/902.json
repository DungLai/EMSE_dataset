There are no special things configured for mlflow. Logging of parameters/metrics works like a charm. If I try to upload an artifact I get problems. The command executes without errors if I create the `/opt/mlruns` dir with proper permissions on my localhost. But only locally my data is saved NOT on the remote host where the server is running. There is no S3 or anything else involved, simple NFS mount. Any idea what I am doing wrong or where this goes wrong???","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/902/reactions","total_count":25,"+1":23,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":2,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/902/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
