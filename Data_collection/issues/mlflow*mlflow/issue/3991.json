Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS 10.15.7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.12.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: \r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow emits a `training_accuracy_score`  of `0.5xx` BUT a confusion matrix artifact which is perfect `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` id matrix. But the real confusion matrix is not, the training data is perfectly random. Whatever I do with the data/model, the artifacts logged are always perfect.\r\n \r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://127.0.0.1:5000')  # set up connection\r\nmlflow.set_experiment('test-experiment')          # set the experiment\r\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog()\r\n\r\ndef make_data(num_points):\r\n    x = np.random.rand(num_points, 1)\r\n    y = np.random.rand(num_points, 1)\r\n    y = np.ravel(np.round(y))\r\n    return x, y\r\n\r\nnum_points = 1000\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    x, y = make_data(num_points)\r\n    model = LogisticRegression()\r\n    model.fit(x, y)\r\n    plot(x, y, model)\r\n\r\ny_pred = model.predict(x)\r\nconfusion_matrix(y, y_pred)\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreenshot: https://snipboard.io/hmeyL9.jpg","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
