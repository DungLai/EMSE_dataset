Here I encounter my two problems:\r\n- How can I run an example code (let's say train.py) so it \"runs\" on the server UI (i.e. hosted on 10.20.30.40:5000) \r\n- and stores the logs, metrics and artifacts online on S3?\r\n\r\nI know I should use MLFlowClient for the tracking and   --default-artifact-root for the S3, but I'm not sure how to rewrite train.py so it runs my server UI, neither it seems to connect to my S3 bucket.\r\n\r\nAny tips on any of those two topics would help a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nDocker Code with which I run the code on my server:\r\n```\r\nRUN pip install mlflow==0.8.2\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /app/\r\n\r\nRUN useradd -u 999 -ms /bin/bash theuser \r\nRUN usermod -aG sudo theuser \r\nRUN passwd -d theuser\r\n\r\nCMD mlflow server \\\r\n    --file-store s3://${BUCKET}/test \\\r\n    --default-artifact-root s3://${BUCKET}/test \\\r\n    --host 10.20.30.40.```","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/917/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
