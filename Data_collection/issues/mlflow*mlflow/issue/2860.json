Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: MacOS Mojave 10.14.5\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.8.0\r\n- **Python version**: python 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow.get_artifact_uri(artifact.path)\r\nArtifact above has been retrieved from list_artifacts. \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI am still a beginner at mlflow so could be dong something wrong -  I want to be able to download artifacts for a run -  I use get_artifact_uri to get the artifact path to pass it download_artifacts path argument. Every time I send a call to get_artifact_uri - I keep getting mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: The experiment 0 must be in the 'active' state. The current state is deleted. I have checked that the artifact uri is set to s3 in the environment variable. My experiment id is not 0, but keeps trying to find that. Also, I checked the experiment passes exists, is active and can be viewed on the UI.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nI have the following function to get the download the data.\r\n\r\ndef get_run_artifacts(run_id, destination_path):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    The function downloads the artifacts for a run\r\n    :param run_id: The unique id for each run\r\n    :param destination_path: The path of the destination\r\n    :return: Nothing. Just downloads and saves the artifacts\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    artifact_list = client.list_artifacts(run_id)\r\n    \r\n    for artifact in artifact_list:\r\n        path = mlflow.get_artifact_uri(path=artifact.path)\r\n        s3_out = S3FileInput(path, create_missing_metadata=True)\r\n\r\nI get the error at:\r\nmlflow.get_artifact_uri(artifact_path=artifact.path)\r\n\r\nI get the run_id using - \r\n\r\nclient = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()\r\nrun_id =client.list_run_infos('45151')[0].run_id\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
