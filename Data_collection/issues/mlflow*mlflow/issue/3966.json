Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, ``xgboost.dask`` training does not work with ``mlflow.xgboost.autolog``. In ``lightgbm==3.2.0`` a similar ``lightgbm.dask`` module will be introduced.\r\n\r\nAs a user, I would expect the autologging to work for XGBoost and LightGBM training in the distributed submodules.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? **autologging/full compatibility with distributed training tracking**\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? **logging with distributed training**\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? **adding distributed XGBoost and LightGBM tutorials to Azure Machine Learning examples https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/pull/324 and https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/pull/326**\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? **i do not know**\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI think more discussion by people familiar with mlflow is needed on how to handle this and similar cases. \r\n\r\nCC: @akshaya-a","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3966/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
