While this works as expected, it requires nested runs to also store the parameters of the parent run if you want to query them in combination. If parameters are only assigned to parent runs, filtering for these will result in the elimination of the child runs.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider organizing hyperparameter optimization runs by having a parent run characterized by more general settings, e.g. the maximal runtime budget for the complete optimization, while the nested runs are individual evaluations for specific parameter sets. It would be redundant to also store all the parent run's parameters (and also metrics btw) in the child runs. If you now want to filter runs with a specific maximal runtime, you will only get these parents runs, but none of their child runs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the lack of the ability to \"jump\" from a parent run to a list of the children runs (as you can jump from the child to the parent, which is of course more \"natural\" due to the ```1:n``` relation of parents to children) makes it difficult to retrieve the actual runs for a specific parameter, which is only available at parent nodes.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nOne could fix this issue by adding a checkbox indicating whether one would also include the nested runs in the search results. Consequently, filtering runs would keep the nested runs in the search result for easier traceability. Since this is often not desired, e.g. to keep the number of search results small, the checkbox is disabled by default. Alternatively, one could add a keyword for the search query, which would include the nested results.\r\nTechnically speaking, this checkbox would change the internal queries, s.t. for each run, which is returned by this statement, all of its nested runs are considered, too.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1984/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1984/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
