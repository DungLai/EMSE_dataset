We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @BenWilson2 in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nInclude model signature and input example information with MLflow Models that are logged during autologging. This functionality is currently only present in a few autologging integrations: [mlflow.xgboost.autolog()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/94891da1c272038ac506f5d091c8c6b19e009b2d/mlflow/xgboost.py#L662-L664), [mlflow.lightgbm.autolog()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/94891da1c272038ac506f5d091c8c6b19e009b2d/mlflow/lightgbm.py#L553-L555), and [mlflow.sklearn.autolog()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/94891da1c272038ac506f5d091c8c6b19e009b2d/mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py#L1227-L1229), but there are many other integrations listed here - https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging - that do not have this functionality. Most prominently, we should add support for TensorFlow and PySpark ML.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Model signatures and input examples make it easier to incorporate ML models into inference workflows.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? ^\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? ^\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Users must currently compute signatures / input examples manually and invoke `mlflow.*.log_model()` to record this information with a persisted MLflow Model. This complicates the autologging experience.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
