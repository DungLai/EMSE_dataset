Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\nYes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### Proposal Summary\r\n\r\n For `MlflowClient.transition_model_version_stage()` change the default value of`archive_existing_versions` to True in order make API model stage transition semantics consistent with those of the MLflow UI.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nMake API semantics consistent with UI semantics for registered model version stage transition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nIn `MlflowClient.transition_model_version_stage()` the default value for argument `archive_existing_versions` is False. This means that if you call this method more than once on an active stage (Production, Staging) you will get multiple versions with the same active stage. For example, if you call the method twice with Production stage, and you get two versions with Production stage. \r\n\r\nThis clashes with the semantics of the MLflow UI where you can only have one version with an active stage. In the UI if you have an existing Production stage and you transition a new version to the Production stage the original version will be transitioned to the Archive stage.\r\n\r\nCustomers who use the API for version stage transition get into an inconsistent UI state. This applies to both OSS and Databricks MLflow.\r\n\r\nFix:  Change the default value of`archive_existing_versions` to True.\r\n\r\nAlso see: \r\n\r\n- [MlflowClient.transition_model_version_stage()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html#mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient.transition_model_version_stage) documentation page.\r\n- https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-export-import/issues/32\r\n\r\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\r\n\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
