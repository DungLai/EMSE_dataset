Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary `pip install mlflow` in conda env\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.10.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.3\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: See code to reproduce section.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nSetting `run_id` in `mlflow.start_run(run_id=)` doe no behave as advertised.\r\nAccording to the [start_run documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run), setting the `run_id` should set the status to running and it does not.\r\n\r\nRelevant line from the doc:\r\n\"run_id – If specified, get the run with the specified UUID and log parameters and metrics under that run. The run’s end time is unset and its status is set to running\"\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\n# Start run and print status (should be Running)\r\nrun = mlflow.start_run()\r\nrun_id = run.info.run_id\r\nprint(f\"Should be RUNNING = {run.info.status}\")\r\n\r\n# Simulate failure and print status (should be FAILED)\r\nmlflow.end_run(status=\"FAILED\")\r\nprint(f\"Should be FAILED = {mlflow.get_run(run_id).info.status}\")\r\n\r\n# Resume failed run from id\r\nresumed_run = mlflow.start_run(run_id)\r\n# Print status of resumed run (should be RUNNING)\r\nprint(f\"Should be RUNNING = {resumed_run.info.status}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [X] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
