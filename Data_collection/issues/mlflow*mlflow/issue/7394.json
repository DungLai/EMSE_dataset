I can contribute this feature independently.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nMake PyFuncModel support pandas DataFrame containing numpy array values, and the spark_udf does not need to convert UDF input numpy array as list when calling `PyFuncModel.predict`.\r\n\r\nBlocker: \r\nScoring server does not support serializing pandas DataFrame containing numpy array values, see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/9c38bd649fe33cf9d2d48316fddc2bb24d765e7c/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/client.py#L69 , we can consider adding a `NumpyEncoder` to fix it.\r\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nMake PyFuncModel support pandas DataFrame containing numpy array values.
