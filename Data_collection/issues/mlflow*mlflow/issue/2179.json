Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address.\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n## Guidelines\r\n\r\nFeature requests typically go through the following lifecycle:\r\n\r\n1. Submit feature request with high-level description on GitHub issues (this is what you're doing now)\r\n2. Discuss feature request with a committer, who may ask for a more detailed design\r\n3. After discussion & agreement on feature request, start implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Describe the proposal\r\nRespect ordering of metrics and params submitted via `log_metrics` and `log_params` and their singular forms `log_metric` and `log_param`\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nWe often track multiple metrics for context, but usually there are only one or two that we're optimizing for and so it makes sense to present them first in the metrics section. \r\n\r\nFor the Params section, we often want to describe the parameters top-down from higher level concepts (e.g. classifier algo) down to the details used to train that algo (e.g. learning rate).\r\n\r\nAlphabetical ordering doesn't make sense in either case and can disrupt consumption of the results by the end-user.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nFor the `log_metrics` and `log_params` methods, respect the ordering of the submitted object. As of Python 3.6, dicts are insertion-ordered and of course you'd want to accept `collections.OrderedDict` for any version.\r\n\r\nFor the `log_metric` and `log_param` methods, respect the order the metrics and params were submitted.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
