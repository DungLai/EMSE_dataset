Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nAbility to view deleted experiments in the MLflow UI. Similar to how runs are viewed, the ability to view deleted experiments, rename them, and restore them in the UI (potentially by adding an option to change the view) might be a useful feature.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nFor current MLflow UI users, experiments can be deleted but once deleted, they can not be seen/restore/renamed. Adding this feature would allow these actions to be done from within the MLflow UI.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThis will allow all MLflow users to maintain/organize experiments from within the UI, and recover old/archived experiments. It will also make the overall experiment lifecycle more visible.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nMy project involves Azure ML integration with Mlflow, including the UI - in Azure, only deleted/archived experiments can be renamed, and they can also be viewed/restored, so this feature would allow for greater parity between the two.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nI believe MLflow is just missing UI components to view deleted experiments by changing a view type, and restore and rename said deleted experiments\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [X] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nI think those are the main general details for the feature!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
