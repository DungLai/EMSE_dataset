Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:  1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nI tried to run my deployment.py file but got an error below:\r\n\r\n**Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"deploy.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    client = get_deploy_client(mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Sihyun\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\deployments\\interface.py\", line 42, in get_deploy_client\r\n    plugin = plugin_store[target]\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Sihyun\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\mlflow\\deployments\\plugin_manager.py\", line 82, in __getitem__\r\n    raise MlflowException(msg, error_code=RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST)\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: No plugin found for managing model deployments to \"file\". In order to deploy models to \"file\", find and install an appropriate plugin from https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html#community-plugins using your package manager (pip, conda etc).**\r\n\r\nBut I already installed azureml-mlflow. I don't know what plugin I should install.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n`from mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport azureml.mlflow\r\n\r\nclient = get_deploy_client(mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nmodel_path = \"model\"\r\nclient.create_deployment(model_uri='runs:/{}/{}'.format(run.id, model_path), name=\"mlflow-test-aci\")`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"seankwon1014","id":46009326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5MzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46009326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014","html_url":"https://github.com/seankwon1014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seankwon1014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4849/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
