Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Arch / Linux Debian / inside docker / outside docker\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.10.0 and current master\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.3\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow models serve --no-conda --host=0.0.0.0 --model-uri=${MODEL_OF_INTEREST_URI}`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen using FTP, I can't serve models - \"550 Failed to open file\". When using sftp everything works fine.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nCreate an experiment / run. Try to serve model from ftp backend.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n`Try to serve model from URI
