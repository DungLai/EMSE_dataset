The most convenient way to look at this is in graph format, and Netron is the go-to tool for this (nearly 20k Github stars). As evidence of the popularity and usefulness, Weights & Biases already [supports](https://community.wandb.ai/t/how-to-visualize-model-graph-in-weights-and-biases/2547/2) Netron for model rendering\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nWe deploy models to iPhones for edge inference which requires conversion to the CoreML graph format. This can alter the types of layers used compared to what was coded in PyTorch, so it's important to visualize the model graph to determine what changed during the conversion. In particular, certain layers (transpose, reshape, etc.) are not supported by Apple's ANE chip. This causes tensors to move back-and-forth between CPU during inference which negates much of the performance benefit from running on ANE. Usually, a combination of visualizing the graph and tweaking the source code can resolve these \r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n\r\nCurrently text, JSON, code, and other artifacts render nicely in the browser, but model graph binary files do not. MLflow sees the model artifacts as an unknown file extension, so it does not attempt to render them. This forces uses to download the file (which can be quite large) and view locally\r\n\n\n### Details\n\nNetron already supports many graph formats natively, so those should be sufficient for most use-cases\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/pipelines`: Pipelines, Pipeline APIs, Pipeline configs, Pipeline Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6726/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
