I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nMLFlow adoption is increasing and MLFlow holds important assets of an enterprise in their AI/ML journey. Experiments, runs and models capture important intellectual property of an organization that need to be secure for legal and business competitive reasons.\r\nIn the attached document we cover two approaches for authorization which can co-exist\r\n    - In built authorization in MLFlow\r\n    - External authorization supported by an external service like Apache Ranger.\r\n\r\n[MLFlow-Authorization.pdf](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/files/10015385/MLFlow-Authorization.pdf)\r\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### What is the use case for this feature?\r\n     MLFlow resources like experiments/runs/models and artifacts constitute intellectual property of an enterprise. A secure and authorized access to these resources provide protection for business/legal reasons. These resources need to be shared across teams without allowing an unauthorized access.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n    MLFlow adoption is increasing rapidly into enterprises in wide variety of business areas. The security needs for enterprises vary but almost all require basic authorization for the protection of their intellectual property.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n   Our customers use MLFlow for their AI experimentation and model development using data that is often sensitive. The models and experiments are also proprietary and need to be protected from unauthorized access.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\n  In the absence of a standardized authorization model in MLFlow, users are forced to build their own authorization layer on top of their MLFlow which becomes an impediment for production deployment of MLFlow.\r\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe attached document includes the feature and outlines two approaches to add authorization in MLFlow. Both approaches can co-exist:\r\n    - Add authorization model in MLFlow based on a few pre-defined roles like manager/editor/reader, with ability to extend them. MLFlow actions are assigned to the roles and enforced based on the role assignment of users.\r\n    - Support external authorization using a standard open source authorization service that helps enterprises to integrate MLFlow authorization to their existing authorization management environment. The document proposes to use Apache Ranger as it is open source (Apache v2 License) and is widely adopted. However, the plugin mechanism can be extended to support other authorization services as well.\r\n[MLFlow-Authorization.pdf](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/files/10015541/MLFlow-Authorization.pdf)\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [X] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [X] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
