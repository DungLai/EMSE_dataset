I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\nmlflow, version 1.28.0\n\n### System information\n\n- **Windows 10 64 bit**:\r\n- **3.9**:\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nThe piece of code provided below is what I am using, and when running this the meta.yaml file is not being created at all. Because of which I am unable to use mlflow UI command or serve the model via mlflow serve. \r\n\r\nI can access the mlflow server and there I can register the models but thats it no way to serve the models.\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\n```python\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np \r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport warnings\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\r\nfrom sklearn import metrics\r\n\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport mlflow.sklearn\r\n\r\nfrom preprocess import preprocess\r\n\r\nimport logging\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri('sqlite:///mlflow.db')\r\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN)\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n\r\nexperiment = mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name = \"Logistic Regression\") \r\nprint(\"Experiment_id: {}\".format(experiment.experiment_id))\r\n\r\nX,y = preprocess() #Any classification data in features, labels format\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n\twarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\r\n\tnp.random.seed(40)\r\n\r\n\tX_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,y,test_size=.25,random_state=3)\r\n\twith mlflow.start_run(run_name = \"Train Run\") as run:\r\n\t\tlog_reg=LogisticRegression(random_state=3, penalty = 'elasticnet', solver='saga', l1_ratio= 0.5)\r\n\t\tlog_reg.fit(X_train,y_train)\r\n\t\ty_pred=log_reg.predict(X_test)\r\n\t\tacc_log_clf = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)\r\n\t\tmlflow.log_metric(\"Accuracy\", acc_log_clf)\r\n\t\tprint('Accuracy score:', acc_log_clf)\r\n\t\tmlflow.sklearn.log_model(\r\n\t\tsk_model=log_reg,\r\n\t\tartifact_path=\"sklearn-model\",\r\n\t\tregistered_model_name=\"sk-learn-logistic-reg-model\"\r\n\t\t)\r\n\t\tprint(\"Model saved in run %s\" % mlflow.active_run().info.run_uuid)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Stack trace\n\nmlflow ui\r\nINFO:waitress:Serving on http://127.0.0.1:5000\r\nWARNING:root:Malformed experiment '1'.
