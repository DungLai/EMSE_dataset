Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:  I use the exact example `sklearn_elasticnet_wine` from MLFlow.\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:  Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:  pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:  1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:  NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:  `mlflow run sklearn_elasticnet_wine`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n- **Expected**: To run successfully the example of sklearn_elasticnet_wine by running `mlflow run sklearn_elasticnet_wine` \r\n- **Reality**: Have `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mlflow'` error.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce the issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n- Clone the MLFLow repo\r\n- `cd examples`\r\n- `mlflow run sklearn_elasticnet_wine`\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
