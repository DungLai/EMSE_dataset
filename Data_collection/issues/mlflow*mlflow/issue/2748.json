Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nWe wonder does it make sense to have a dynamic sorting function at model comparison interface?\r\nFor now, we can only sort models by column before choosing the model to compare. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nFor visualization of model metrics comparison.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThe function should improve the experience of users who wants to sort the model results by metrics on the figure.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nWe are users who wants to sort the model results by metrics on the figures, and that improves our experience :)\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nFor now, we can only sort models by column before choosing the model to compare.  If we want to sort the models by other metrics we need to go back to do the same thing every time.\r\n\r\n## Which MLflow component(s) does this feature affect?\r\n\r\n- [x] UI\r\n- [ ] Command Line Interface\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Examples\r\n- [ ] Docs\r\n- [ ] Tracking\r\n- [ ] Projects\r\n- [ ] Artifacts\r\n- [ ] Models\r\n- [ ] Model Registry\r\n- [ ] Scoring\r\n- [ ] R\r\n- [ ] Java\r\n- [ ] Python\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nNAN\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal\r\nfor how to implement this feature, please include it here.
