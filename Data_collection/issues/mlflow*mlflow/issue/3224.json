Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\nMLflow Version: 1.10.0\r\nKeras version: 2.4.0\r\nTensorFlow version: 2.3.0\r\nPython Version: 3.7.6\r\nOperating System: Darwin - 19.4.0\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nCannot save TensorFlow 2.3.0  Keras model as TensorFlow SaveModel format  using mlflow.keras.log_model since it does not honor kwargs { \"save_format\": \"tf\" }.  The saved model is still H5.  The  suffix is [hard-coded to h5](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/keras.py#L207) and not dependent on the value of save_format.\r\n\r\nTensorFlow SaveModel format is now the default for Keras TensorFlow 2.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport mlflow.keras\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\r\n\r\ndef baseline_model():\r\n    model = Sequential()\r\n    model.add(Dense(2, input_dim=2, kernel_initializer=\"normal\", activation=\"relu\"))\r\n    model.compile(loss=\"mean_squared_error\", optimizer=\"adam\")\r\n    return model\r\nmodel = baseline_model()\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n    mlflow.keras.log_model(model, \"tensorflow-model\", **{ \"save_format\": \"tf\" })\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\n`{ \"save_format\": \"tf\" }`  is correctly passed to `keras_model.save`  at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/keras.py#L208 but output is H5.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.h5') as f:\r\n            keras_model.save(f.name, **kwargs)\r\n            f.flush()  # force flush the data\r\n            shutil.copyfile(src=f.name, dst=model_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n\r\n###  Related Issues\r\n- https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3246 - [FR] Serialization format for TensorFlow 2.x (Keras) model should be Save Model per TF 2.0 doc\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3224/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
