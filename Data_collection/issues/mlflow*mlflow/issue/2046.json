Using the default file store, no parameters.  I'm trying to figure out the the exact steps to reproduce but it happens pretty often.  I think deleting ./mlruns fixes it temporarily.  \r\n\r\nI have a related issue that I'll file in another bug that may point to the model registry as a source of the issue.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\ncd example/sklearn_elasticnet_wine\r\nmlflow run .\r\nmlflow ui\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n```\r\n(base) ➜  mlflow git:(prophet-example) ✗ mlflow ui\r\n/usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jinja2/utils.py:485: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working\r\n  from collections import MutableMapping\r\n/usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jinja2/runtime.py:318: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working\r\n  from collections import Mapping\r\n[2019-11-05 11:19:49 -0500] [36160] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0\r\n[2019-11-05 11:19:49 -0500] [36160] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (36160)\r\n[2019-11-05 11:19:49 -0500] [36160] [INFO] Using worker: sync\r\n[2019-11-05 11:19:49 -0500] [36163] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 36163\r\n/usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jinja2/utils.py:485: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working\r\n  from collections import MutableMapping\r\n/usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jinja2/runtime.py:318: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working\r\n  from collections import Mapping\r\n^C[2019-11-05 11:20:11 -0500] [36160] [INFO] Handling signal: int\r\n[2019-11-05 11:20:11 -0500] [36163] [INFO] Worker exiting (pid: 36163)\r\n\r\nAborted!\r\n[2019-11-05 11:20:11 -0500] [36160] [INFO] Shutting down: Master\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dr3s","id":145115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTExNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s","html_url":"https://github.com/dr3s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr3s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2046/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
