I would like also to store my artifacts into my own folder in HDFS. It will enable me to contribute to an experiment owned by someone else.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWe use HDFS to store artifacts. If I create an experiment that uses my HDFS folder as default artifact URI. My colleagues cannot create a new runs in my experiment.\r\nOur current workaround is to use \"groups\" and gives access to the group to the mlflow artifacts folder. All members of the group will be allowed to add artifacts.\r\n We would like to remove this workaround and enable in MLFlow to have in the same experiment, several runs that use different artifacts folders.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nTo implement this story, I propose the following changes:\r\n* Override the default artifact URI when I create a run. => add an new option `artifact_uri` to create_run function\r\n* Add a function in HDFS store class to change the default artifact URI to point to a folder in my HDFS folder. For this task, we can assume HDFS folder are like `/user/USERNAME/`\r\n* If I create a run to an experiment with default URI is like `hdfs://namenode/user/some_username/...` replace some_username by my username and store my artifacts in this folder.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2082/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
