More specifically, how can I specify my predict function that will be called by the controller?\r\nAdditionally, it would be very useful to train my ML models on Sagemaker using the mlflow commands.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nI'd like to integrate Sagify (https://github.com/Kenza-AI/sagify, it's one of my open source projects) to mlflow so that to train and deploy ML models on Sagemaker. Please, check the workflow that I'd like to add to mlflow:\r\n\r\nProposal for Training and Deploying on SageMaker:\r\n\r\n1. `mlflow sagemaker init -d src`: This will create all boilerplate code under the directory `src` where all my ML code lives. My ML code under `src` uses already mlflow.\r\n2. Then, I need to implement two functions, `train(...)` and `predict(input_json)`. The `train(...)` function should call my ML training logic that already lives under `src`, and I need to implement my transformer from JSON to an ML friendly data type in the `predict(input_json)` function. \r\n3. `mlflow sagemaker build`: It will build a Docker image that will contains all the code under `src`\r\n4. `mlflow sagemaker push`: It will push the built Docker image to ECS\r\n5. `mlflow sagemaker local-train`: It will the training logic that lives in the Docker image. This can be used for testing before trying on SageMaker\r\n6. `mlflow sagemaker local-deploy`: It will run the Docker image on deploy mode where I can test the rest endpoint that calls the trained model.\r\n7. `mlflow sagemaker train`: It will run the Docker image on train mode on SageMaker\r\n8. `mlflow sagemaker deploy`: It will run the Docker image on deploy mode on SageMaker\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal Only for Deploying on SageMaker:\r\n\r\n1. `mlflow sagemaker init -d src`: This will create all boilerplate code under the directory `src` where all my ML code lives.
