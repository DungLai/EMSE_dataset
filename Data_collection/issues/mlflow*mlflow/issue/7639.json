I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\n\n### URL(s) with the issue\n\nIt appears there's a somewhat undocumented plugin interface for experiment context providers. These appear to allow auto-tagging/custom creation of experiments. I see it marked as developer stable.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/branch-1.13/mlflow/tracking/context/abstract_context.py\r\n\r\nAre these safe to subclass in a plugin? I see the databricks provider in the source and would like to implement something similar via a plugin. \n\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing)\n\nDocument the experiment context provider and maybe add an example plugin. I'd be willing to contribute it if this is the intended use case for this interface.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
