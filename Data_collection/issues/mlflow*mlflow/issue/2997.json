Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIn version 1.9.0's documentation, it appeared the ability to add tags to registered models was added: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#mlflowregisteredmodel and https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#mlflowregisteredmodeltag. We were excited to use the new functionality and upgraded immediately. However, they don't seem to be exposed in the GUI (unsure if they exist in the code). Request they be added to the code/GUI as required.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Currently we tag all versions that are registered with a model with the same tag in order to simulate a registered model tag. Trying to parse the registered model description's free text field was determined to be an anti-pattern and we didn't go that route.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Anyone who has classes of registered models and who uses the API to query for certain types would benefit from tags at the registered model level. I'm sure there are many other use cases. Having it exposed in the GUI is critical for non-developers to be able to see and modify the tags.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Keeping consistent tags at the version level is error prone and errors will almost inevitably occur. We're using MLflow to drive model deployment to our operational system, so missing tags at the version level could cause incorrect models to be automatically deployed.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? This is repetitive, but storing duplicate tags on every version is not a best practice for data management. It is also more error prone. Finally, querying the tags for each version through the API requires a separate API call for each, adding unnecessary code/queries.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI think I've provided enough detail above but please contact me if more is required.","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
