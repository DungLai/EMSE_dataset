Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md)\r\nfor information on what types of issues we address. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\nPlease fill in this template and do not delete it unless you are sure your issue is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Applies to OSX, Unix, Windows\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary (pip)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.6.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nFor distributed ML use cases, it is often useful to create multiple child runs within a single parent run from multiple nodes / processes. Accomplishing this task currently requires the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1. On the driver, create a parent run `run A`\r\n2. On the worker, resume `run A`\r\n3. On the worker, once `run A` has been resumed, create a nested run: `run B`\r\n\r\nThe worker procedure requires two separate calls to `mlflow.start_run()`, as follows:\r\n```\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_id=<run_id_of_run_A>):\r\n    with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):\r\n        mlflow.log_param(\"my-param\", \"my-value\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following attempt to shorten/optimize this procedure fails to create a nested run:\r\n```\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_id=run_id, nested=True):\r\n    mlflow.log_param(\"my-param\", \"my-value\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `my-param` is logged directly to `run A`, rather than a new nested run (`run B`). Apparently, the `nested=True` argument is ignored in this case.\r\n\r\nBased on the documentation for `start_run()` (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run), it seems like a new nested run should be created:\r\n```\r\nnested â€“ Controls whether run is nested in parent run. True creates a nest run.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the current behavior appears to be a bug.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
