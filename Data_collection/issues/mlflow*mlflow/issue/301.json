It would be nice to see the script released because adding features that require changing the service proto would be tedious without being able to regenerate the JS SDK.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/301/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
