This will enable anyone using the Prediction REST API to pass human readable data to the service and thus better encapsulates the transformation dependency.  \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nUsers of the Prediction REST API will not be required to manage and run a transformation dependency.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Changes\r\nIt feels like the best place to add this functionality is in the model API. The predict method will call the transform method before proceeding.
