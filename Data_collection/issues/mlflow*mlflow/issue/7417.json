Currently, some MLflow backends (e.g. RestStore) limit the number of results returned by `search_model_versions` requests. Clients must fetch subsequent results by making new requests using a provided page token. Unfortunately, the MLflow Python client's https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_model_versions method doesn't accept page tokens, so users can't easily load the next page of results.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? ^ \r\n\r\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? ^ \r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_model_versions doesn't accept a page token\r\n\n\n### Details\n\nWe'll need to introduce a `page_token=None` argument to https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.client.html#mlflow.client.MlflowClient.search_model_versions. We'll also need to introduce `page_token=None` to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7f2152370b8e93ed7bf8cc3e5e1e7ff39cd69ca5/mlflow/store/model_registry/abstract_store.py#L217 and all stores that extend from the Model Registry `AbstractStore`.\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7417/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
