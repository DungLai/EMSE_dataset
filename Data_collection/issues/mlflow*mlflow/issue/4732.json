Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip installed\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.19.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: Hit model registry API (into remote server) whose certificate protected (need to attach client certificate into API request)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCurrently the model registry API is not correctly attaching the client and/or server certificate (when defined) as tracking API. The issue is due to both client_cert_path and server_cert_path are not passed into MlflowHostCreds for model registry rest store utils (mlflow/tracking/_model_registry/utils.py). This is causing issue when we tried to use mlflow model serve cli that hitting on certificate protected DNS\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is just simply pass the client_cert_path and server_cert_path into MLFlowHost similar with tracking rest store (mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/utils.py)\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n- Setting up remote mlflow server with model registry\r\n- Protect DNS with client certificate requirement\r\n- Hit any model registry API into the certificate protected DNS (or run `mlflow models serve/prepare-env`)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ericgosno91","id":45553006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTUzMDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45553006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91","html_url":"https://github.com/ericgosno91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericgosno91/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4732/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
