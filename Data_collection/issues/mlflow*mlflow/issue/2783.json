Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix\r\nfor this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes.

This blocks a lot of the tests running on Windows. \r\n\r\nI guess we should detect windows paths and prepend a `file` prefix? \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\n from mlflow.tracking.artifact_utils import _download_artifact_from_uri\r\n_download_artifact_from_uri('C:\\\\some_path\\\\to\\\\artifacts')\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in: \r\n\r\n```\r\nMlflowException: Could not find a registered artifact repository for: c:.
