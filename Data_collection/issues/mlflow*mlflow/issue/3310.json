I do not want to create a new S3 bucket for each of these servers as this number can be quite high.\r\nIs it possible to give S3 paths (within the same S3 bucket) as default artifact store? Something like\r\n`--default-artifact-root s3://bucket-name/teeam-name`\r\n\r\nAlso, any good alternative to having a separate MLFlow server running for each team?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis way, users can segregate their MLFlow servers within the same S3 bucket.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
