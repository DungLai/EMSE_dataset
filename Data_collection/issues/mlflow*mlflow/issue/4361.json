Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe `pyfunc.spark_udf` method allows the caller to specify the result type like 'int'. However it does not accept 'boolean'. The proposal is simply to add this, corresponding to `BooleanType` / pandas `bool` to the list of supported types.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nFor example, 'sklearn' models can definitely return `boolean` from `predict`, so it's useful to be able to consume the predictions as a boolean column in Spark. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nSee above and, more generally, Pyspark and pandas certainly support boolean types.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nThis arose while constructing a demo of MLflow and a simple sklearn model, but, I think that's a proxy for real use cases.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nOtherwise it has to result in a string column with values like \"True\", which is easy enough to turn into a boolean by testing for `== \"True\"`. Not a big deal, but also possibly no big change.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\n\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [X] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nPretty straightforward. BooleanType is not supported at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py#L795\r\n\r\nThis seems to even have been on purpose, but wasn't clear to me what the reason was - not used?\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/719#discussion_r240415702","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
