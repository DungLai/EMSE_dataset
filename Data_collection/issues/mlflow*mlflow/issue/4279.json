Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAdd an option to provide a custom format for run folder naming (which is currently just the run_id). I understand that the names should be unique, but this could still be achieved by still including the run_id. I'm imagining an optional string input somewhere that could for example look like this: \"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S_{some other run info / custom string}_{run_id}\", which is then formatted using datetime and the run attributes.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nVery helpful for everyone who needs to access run files like artifacts manually from time to time.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jenspetersen","id":12710698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzEwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12710698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen","html_url":"https://github.com/jenspetersen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4279/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
