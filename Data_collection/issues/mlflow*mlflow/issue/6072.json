I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### MLflow version\n\n1.26.1\n\n### System information\n\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 11\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n- **yarn version, if running the dev UI**: n/a\r\n\n\n### Describe the problem\n\nWith MLflow 1.26.1, I am getting an `AttributeError` at import when using older versions of protobuf (in my case, 3.18.1) that are still permitted by the conda recipe's `protobuf >=3.7.0` constraint.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a relatively new issue that does not impact MLflow 1.26.0; this also only seems to be impacting Windows, as the same environment on Linux machines does not result in failures.\n\n### Tracking information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code to reproduce issue\n\nCreate a conda environment on Windows with latest MLflow and an older version of protobuf:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ conda create -n mlflow-repro python=3.9 mlflow=1.26.1 protobuf=3.18.1\r\n$ conda activate mlflow-repro\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttempt to run `mlflow`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mlflow\r\n```\n\n### Other info / logs\n\n```python-traceback\r\nTraceback (most recent call
