Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [X ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nThe documentation of MLFlow regarding artifact store is pretty basic.\r\nIn my specific case, I'm trying to setup it in using SFTP but there some specific things need to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nBasically I just want to connect to an SFTP running in x.x.x.x:9222 with a specific private key. Is that even possible in the current implementation?\r\n\r\nThere is no explanation on how to use specific IdentityFiles, I have already try to define then in ~/.ssh/config with no luck but, after checking the source code, I saw that it will use a the default file called 'id_rsa' if none it is specified, so It did the trick.Regarding the custom port issue, I havent found a solution to solve it yet.\r\n\r\nI will be glad to contribute with a working example for future users with MLFlow + SFTP if I achieve this but I will need some help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
