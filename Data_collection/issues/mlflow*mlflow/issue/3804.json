Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a link to the documentation entry in question.\r\n\r\n[https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html)\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\nProvide a clear description. Why is the proposed documentation better?\r\n\r\nWhen writing a plugin for MLFlow it is not clear that you need to configure your logging separately for the plugin. (At least it wasn't to me.)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that MLFlow currentl sets the logging at the level of `mlflow`. When you define a plugin without configuring your own logging it reverts to the root logger, which still has the default configuration. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is obvious behaviour to some, but it wasn't to me personally. I think it would help to highlight this point in the documentation. My current solution is to call `_configure_mlflow_loggers(__name__)` in the plugin.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3804/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
