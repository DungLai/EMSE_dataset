Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**:3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:None\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow.log_artifact(<filepath>,artifact_path=artifact_dir)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen using mlflow.log_artifact I am getting the following error\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Invalid artifact path: '/claraDevDay/MMARs/AutoML/commands/mlruns/artifact_root'. Names may be treated as files in certain cases, and must not resolve to other names when treated as such. This name would resolve to '/claraDevDay/MMARs/AutoML/commands/mlruns/artifact_root'\r\n\r\n'/claraDevDay/MMARs/AutoML/commands/mlruns/artifact_root' is a valid directory\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\nmlflow.log_artifact(config_path,artifact_path=artifact_dir)\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"akemisetti","id":4714062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTQwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4714062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti","html_url":"https://github.com/akemisetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akemisetti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3464/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
