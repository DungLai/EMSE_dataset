I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nWhen I set  my experiment name in python code ( and it's a new name ), mlflow builds a new set of log folders in the <ins>`path`</ins> of python code. This means I couldn't track artifacts in UI, if `mlflow server` doesn't start from the <ins>`path`</ins>. This makes me confused !! \r\n\r\nIn another word, we couldn't see artifacts when we run `mlflow server` from another places ( even if we set `backend-store-uri` and \n\n### Motivation\n\n> #### Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThis is a small feature which make my use more comfortable. Also I believe it's make other's too.\r\n\r\n> #### Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?\r\nIn latest versions, we should set the path of new experiment from other places at first ( ex. set it in UI ). But if this feature would be added, it could be set easily on the code.\n\n### Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### What component(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- [ ] `area/recipes`: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\n### What interface(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\n\n### What language(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\n\n### What integration(s) does this bug affect?\n\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
