Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nUpgrade proto files to use proto3 to enable the generation of .NET, Go, Dart code. The changes are relatively minor, but there may be some breaking changes. See this PR for reference on the changes that would need to be done. Make note of the proto files. \r\n\r\nThe required changes include:\r\n\r\n- Remove `optional` keyword.\r\n- Default values are based on primitive types, not as defined by user in proto file (potentially breaking)\r\n- Enums have to start at 0 (potentially breaking)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\n.NET, Go, Dart developers can access rich MLFLow lifecycle management features.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nMeet customers in the platforms they're working on.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nCompilation of .NET, Go, Dart requires proto3.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [X] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [X] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [X] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here.
