Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:  1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql://postgres:mdp@127.0.0.1:5432/mlflow --host 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMetrics are well plotted on Chrome but not on Firefox v84.0.2.\r\n\r\nOn Firefox, if I do several runs of the same experiment, curves metrics are plotted for the latest run but not for the older ones. \r\n\r\nFirst run (Firefox): \r\n![firefox_mlflow_first_success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12247702/104356926-d4050780-550c-11eb-893c-1184d9262e8e.png)\r\n\r\nSecond run (Firefox): \r\n![firefox_plot_fail_mlflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12247702/104356934-d6fff800-550c-11eb-94d8-d1c32bfd2b5a.png)\r\n\r\nSecond run (Chrome): \r\n![chrome_plot_works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12247702/104356944-db2c1580-550c-11eb-880f-8fbcf662163e.png)\r\n\r\nAnd I am getting this issue for all runs except (sometimes) for the first one because sometimes even the latest run is not shown, but I don't understand why. I think the core issue is due to Firefox graph plot library but I hope that it is easy to reproduce.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nI could reproduce this bug using `examples/tensorflow/tf2/train_predict_2.py`.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nN/a\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sdrll","id":12247702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ3NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12247702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll","html_url":"https://github.com/sdrll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdrll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
