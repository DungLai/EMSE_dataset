Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Databricks 9.1LTS runtime\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: %pip install mlflow\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.24.0\r\n- **Python version**: mlflow, version 1.24.0\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow.spark.autolog()\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWhen I enable `mlflow.spark.autolog()` then trigger two different runs with `with mlflow.start_run()` and under each run use spark.read.load(xxx) with different data source, the run's tag `sparkDatasourceInfo` will append those sources and show in the experiments. I'm expecting that different runs should clean up the tag of `sparkDatasourceInfo` first and then append whatever data source used within the current run.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nmlflow.spark.autolog()\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    df = spark.read.format(\"csv\").load(\"path1\")\r\n    display(df)\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    df = spark.read.format(\"csv\").load(\"path2\")\r\n    display(df)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
