Depending on project we can track hundreds of data points per run. So we end up on mlruns folder with 50k 100k files, even if for a lower number of runs.\r\n\r\nWe are considering sql backends also, but wondering if even in the filesystem could we have some workarounds available, like caching, or aggregating, especially for stale/closed runs.\r\n\r\nThis and the fact we can't use mlflowui to compare runs in different experiments (we use one backend per project), highly reduces the usefulness of mlflow ui projects with large number of runs. We end up producing a huge dataframe (which we can update around ~1 min for a few thousands of runs), which is even cached, refreshed only on a need basis. \r\n\r\nBlazingly fast, but we lose the mlflow, so was thinking if some kind of caching could be enabled for mlflow server/ui? refreshed periodically, something like that.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1902/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
