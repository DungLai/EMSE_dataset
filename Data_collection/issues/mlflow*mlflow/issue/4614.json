Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\nI propose somehow to give the user the ability to pass the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`variable from the MLproject file instead of setting the environment variable. I think it is more controllable and easy to implement since you already take variables out of MLproject file \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? \r\nIt is very useful whenever you want to set MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? \r\nThis feature will solve a problem a lot of MLflow projects users has faced. Which is setting  `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` variable. If you set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` after running the `mlflow run` you will get a `RESOURCE NOT FOUND` error. This is because the run is create on one tracking URI and then you are trying to access it on another URI. This feature will help to avoid having this problem.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? \r\nAs most of organizations, we always try to log our output on a remote server so we always try to set MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI to a remote server instead logging locally \r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) \r\nI don't think it is difficult to achieve\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow server, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [x] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
