Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS 10.13.6\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary (mlflow-1.11.0-py3-none-any.whl)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.11.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nIf an experiment contains a run that has an empty or NaN metric, trying to sort the runs in the UI based on that metric fails and an \"INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR\" is displayed. \r\nAn inspection of _search_utils.py_ reveals that a check for nulls and nans is done prior to sorting, to ensure runs with nulls/nans appear at the end of the sorted list. This does not prevent the sorting from failing. A quick fix can be done like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def _get_value_for_sort(cls, run, key_type, key, ascending):\r\n        \"\"\"Returns a tuple suitable to be used as a sort key for runs.\"\"\"\r\n        sort_value = None\r\n        if key_type == cls._METRIC_IDENTIFIER:\r\n            sort_value = run.data.metrics.get(key)\r\n\r\n            # NEW CODE: Check if the value is null or nan and replace with +/- inf\r\n            if sort_value is None or (\r\n                isinstance(sort_value, float) and math.isnan(sort_value) ):\r\n                if ascending:\r\n                    sort_value = math.inf\r\n                else:\r\n                    sort_value = -math.inf\r\n           ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if this problem also exists when sorting based on other parameter than metrics.\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n```\r\n2020/09/10 12:15:10 ERROR mlflow.server: Exception on /ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/runs/search [POST]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File
