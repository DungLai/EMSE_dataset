I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nOn the MLflow UI, add a refresh button above the table. When clicking on this button, the runs are reloaded. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis feature is useful when new runs have been made since we loaded the interface. The current way to display new runs on the interface is to refresh the whole page, but by doing it we loose the display adjustments we made (collapse experiments list, column lengths, filters, etc.).\r\nOne of my usage of MLFlow is to open the interface, then open runs on new tabs to compare them. Then, I perform new runs on my ML code, I come back to the interface, retrieve the new runs (painful step to refresh the whole page each time I come back to the interface) and open the new experiments on new tabs.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI propose to implement a button like this one (the left one). It seems to require to modify the components `ExperimentView` and `ExperimentPage`. It would be a pleasure to work on it (as my first contribution !) once I have your validation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23191816/107146079-22f46000-6946-11eb-9b3c-81742fab16f4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4073/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4073/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
