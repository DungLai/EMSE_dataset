Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Azure Databricks runtime 8.3\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Azure Databricks\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.13.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `mlflow.spark.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=\"models:{model_name}/{version}\")`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow registered Spark model on Databricks is unreachable by Spark after `mlflow.spark.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=\"models:{model_name}/{version}\")`. In addition, load_model does not accept an artifact download destination directory. This means that MLFlow will always use a tmp directory created on the local filesystem of the cluster driver, which is an unrecommended, unmonitored and untrused download location.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nUse Databricks fuse filesystem to download artifacts to dbfs. Readable by Python and PySpark. \r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\nUntrusted download of artifacts on local filesystem of cluster driver. Spark model data is downloaded to filesystem which is unreachable by spark and untrusted by dbutils. DBFS artifact repository returns a Local artifact repository, but download artifacts method uses local filesystem through Python `tempfile.mkdtemp` without the possibility of providing a download target directory.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. register spark model with parquet in data \r\n2. `mlflow.spark.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=\"models:{model_name}/{version}\")`\r\n3. try to read model data with spark\r\n\r\nA possible workaround copying local directory to dbfs is only possible if local filesystem is configured as trusted in Databricks, which is not recommended!\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- Python 3.8\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"luuk-codebeez","id":62172029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTcyMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62172029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez","html_url":"https://github.com/luuk-codebeez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luuk-codebeez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
