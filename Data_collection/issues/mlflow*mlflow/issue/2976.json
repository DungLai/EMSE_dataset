I think this behavior is dangerous. Let's consider a scenario where a user wants to select the best model from a bunch of runs and writes the code below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\norder_by = [\"metrics.accuracy DECS\"]  # \"DECS\" is a typo, should be \"DESC\"\r\nsorted_runs = mlflow.search_runs(..., order_by=order_by)\r\nbest_run = sorted_runs.iloc[0]  # select the frist row\r\nbest_model = load_model_from_run(best_run)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this code does is:\r\n- The `order_by` expression `\"metrics.accuracy DECS\"` doesn't end with ` desc` or ` asc` so it's parsed as a metric named `accuracy DECS`.\r\n- `search_runs` sorts runs by the metric `accuracy DECS` which doesn't exist and returns unsorted runs.\r\n- `sorted_runs.iloc[0]` is obviously not the best run, **but no error or warning is raised**.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
