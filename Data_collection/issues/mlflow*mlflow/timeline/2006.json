@mirekphd Do you have a proposal for a better algorithm on how many digits/sig figs to show? The original proposal was about avoiding losing precision with small numbers.\r\n\r\nYes, we did observe precision loss. For instance we have these six models becoming indistinguishable, apparently due to loss of 1 significant digit in RMSE (zeros seem to be counted to the limit of 4 digits displayed by mlflow's UI):\r\nfin_mod_oot_r2    | 0.358 | 0.356 | 0.355 | 0.35 | 0.354 | 0.354 | \r\nfin_mod_oot_rmse 0.077 | 0.077 | 0.077 | 0.077 | 0.077 | 0.077 | \r\n\r\nHowever, this may be related to our client-server combination, specifically the server version being prior to the above fix for #2006. Only client library is automatically kept up to date by our CI/CD (currently at 1.8.0), while server version is lagging, currently at 1.3.0 (from Oct 1, 2019, which is prior to the above fix from Nov 7, 2019). You think server upgrade would solve it?\r\n\r\nStill, It would be best to be able to control precision in `log_metric()` for each metric separately, because while 3 places is fine for \"large\" metrics like R^2 or AUC, it is way too aggregated for RMSE or logloss, where 4 or 5 are needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/641470429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mirekphd","id":36706320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzA2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36706320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd","html_url":"https://github.com/mirekphd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3426128851,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQyNjEyODg1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3426128851","actor":{"login":"mirekphd","id":36706320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzA2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36706320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd","html_url":"https://github.com/mirekphd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T17:43:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3426128854,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MjYxMjg4NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3426128854","actor":{"login":"mirekphd","id":36706320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzA2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36706320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd","html_url":"https://github.com/mirekphd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T17:43:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/641480549","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2006#issuecomment-641480549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2006","id":641480549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTQ4MDU0OQ==","user":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T18:03:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T18:03:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The
