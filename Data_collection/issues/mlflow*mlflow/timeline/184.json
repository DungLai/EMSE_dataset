We did opt for absolute paths in the source name & artifact URI because they allow us to display absolute paths to artifacts in the UI / show an `mlflow run` command in the UI that can be used to reproduce the original run (independent of working directory).\r\n\r\nFor sharing / accessing information about runs across machines, we recommend running a  tracking server accessible to both machines ([see docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#running-a-tracking-server)) - admittedly this is a bit more heavyweight to set up than checking `mlruns` into version control, but it has the advantage of easily staying in sync across machines. Thanks & hope that helps!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/412232150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1783552444,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc4MzU1MjQ0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783552444","actor":{"login":"Nithanaroy","id":670556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDU1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy","html_url":"https://github.com/Nithanaroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T23:36:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1783552446,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3ODM1NTI0NDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783552446","actor":{"login":"Nithanaroy","id":670556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDU1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy","html_url":"https://github.com/Nithanaroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nithanaroy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T23:36:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1783552517,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3ODM1NTI1MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783552517","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T23:36:34Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/413361768","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/184#issuecomment-413361768","issue_u
