@mapa17, thanks for filing. \r\n\r\nThe pyfunc models are wrapped to ensure uniform interface. I think it's ok to access the _model_impl directly in your case since you know that your model is a `mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` and there is no way to load it directly. We may add a public accessor or a way to store additional metadata directly in the MLmodel file in the future. But for now I would recommend to access the _model_impl directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/662154760/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3573474926,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU3MzQ3NDkyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3573474926","actor":{"login":"mapa17","id":1401861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDE4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1401861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17","html_url":"https://github.com/mapa17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-21T23:18:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3573474928,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1NzM0NzQ5Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3573474928","actor":{"login":"mapa17","id":1401861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDE4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1401861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17","html_url":"https://github.com/mapa17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapa17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-21T23:18:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3573478021,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NzM0NzgwMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3573478021","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-21T23:20:29Z","label":{"name":"priority/important-soon","color":"534cb5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlfl
