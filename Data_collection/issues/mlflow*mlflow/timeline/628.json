Continuing to improve support for using hyperparam optimization libs is high on the roadmap priorities. \r\n\r\nIn 0.8.0, which was released 11 days ago, the UI was improved to better support visualizing  runs from hyperparam searches and multi-step workfkows.\r\n\r\nQuote from the release notes:\r\n> Runs that are \"nested\" inside other runs (e.g., as part of a hyperparameter search or multistep workflow) now show up grouped by their parent run, and can be expanded or collapsed altogether. Runs can be nested by calling mlflow.start_run or mlflow.run while already within a run.\r\n\r\nAlso, Have you seen this example code demonstrating using MLflow with hyperparam techniques/lib randon search, hyperopt, gpyopt - https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/hyperparam\r\n\r\nI would love to know more specifically the shape that folks in the community would like to see further investments in AutoML take. More UI improvements? More Examples or docs? New APIs or commands supported by the CLI? Also, please give examples of proposed APIs, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/439916277/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andyk","id":228998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODk5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk","html_url":"https://github.com/andyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/531420385","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/628#issuecomment-531420385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/628","id":531420385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTQyMDM4NQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T23:25:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T23:25:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
