May I ask a few questions to clarify the problem a bit? \r\nFrom the initial issue and description, I feel like that we can directly wrap over mlflow.pyfunc's methods into the utility function to make validation of data schemas work for all flavors, and `predict` just comes for free. The only difference is that _enforce_schema has certain limits on the data type, and prediction results may fall out of that range.

@serena-ruan! Thank you for clarifying.\r\n\r\n- I think that exposing an `mlflow.models.validate_schema()` method with the same arguments from your `SchemaUtils.validate_schema` method is a great idea.\r\n\r\n- Right now, `mlflow.pyfunc.predict()` already performs schema validation, so `model.predict(data)` will already fail if `data` does not match the model's schema. Accordingly, I don't think we need `predict_and_validate_schema`.\r\n\r\n- Finally, it would be nice to make it easier for users to fetch the signature of the model using the URI. For this, I think we can introduce an `mlflow.models.get_model_info()` method that returns a https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.models.html#mlflow.models.model.ModelInfo object corresponding to the model.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this helps, and apologies for the slight ambiguity in the issue description.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1216986852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7199464289,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85MAHRfzwAAAAGtHxth","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7199464289","actor":{"login":"serena-ruan","id":82044803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDQ0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82044803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan","html_url":"https://github.com/serena-ruan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-16T18:16:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7199464297,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85MAHRfzwAAAAGtHxtp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7199464297","actor":{"login":"serena-ruan","id":82044803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDQ0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82044803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan","html_url":"https://github.com/serena-ruan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-16T18:16:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7199468833,"node_id":"AE_lADOCB5Jx85MAHRfzwAAAAGtHy0h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7199468833","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-16T18:16:47Z","assignee":{"login":"serena-ruan","id":82044803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDQ0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82044803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serena-ruan","html_url":"https://github.com/sere

I don't think we want to validate the output schema of predictions produced by the model, since we can trust that the model produces outputs according to its schema.

Users may not want to download and restore the model in order to read its signature, e.g. if the model has a lot of dependencies.
