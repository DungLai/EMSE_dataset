@lukemerrick : Thanks for filing this issue. Could you provide more details about the specific problem you have seen with this? You mentioned that\r\n\r\n> saved/logged `tf.keras` models don't seem to run properly as `pyfunc` flavored models\r\n\r\nWhat do you see? The the model through errors or not predicting expected results. If you could paste the error message you see or a stack trace that leads you believe there is a specific issue, that would be super helpful.\r\n\r\nSince you are logging the model as a keras model, you should be able to serialize it as either pyfunc or keras flavor. Are you able to load it locally using `mlflow.keras.load_model` and predict using that?

@lukemerrick, sorry for the delay. I believe I identified the bug and have a fix in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2762. The error was due to the MLflow implementation of the `keras` `pyfunc` expecting the input of arrays/list of arrays instead of a `pandas` dataframe.\r\n\r\nAs for `mlflow.keras.load_model.predict()` erroring out, this is expected since using this function loads the actual `keras` model back using `keras` native functions. You should be passing in arrays instead of `pandas` dataframes in your code for that error.\r\n\r\nI don't know why the second call of `print(mlf_model.predict(test_input))` worked, I'll looks more into that...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/622204006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"juntai-zheng","id":39497939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng","html_url":"https://github.com/juntai-zheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3291936210,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI5MTkzNjIxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3291936210","actor":{"login":"lukemerrick","id":8729935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Mjk5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick","html_url":"https://github.com/lukemerrick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T01:24:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3291936211,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyOTE5MzYyMTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3291936211","actor":{"login":"lukemerrick","id":8729935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Mjk5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick","html_url":"https://github.com/lukemerrick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemerrick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T01:24:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3294684663,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyOTQ2ODQ2NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3294684663","actor":{"login":"sueann","id":4411489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTE0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4411489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann","html_url":"https://github.com/sueann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T22:48:15Z","label":{"name":"area/scoring","color":"48eabc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/623639241","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2552#
