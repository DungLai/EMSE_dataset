haven't looked into the specifics of \"nested run\" yet (and would appreciate some pointers on what it actually entails).\r\nI think in general it's a good idea to ensure the `mlflow` R package have feature parity with the Python client, so that people using mlflow won't find themselves missing some capabilities because they work with R instead of

So looks like the `nested` argument is purely for book-keeping and sanity-checks on client side. Client cannot accidentally create a nested-run unless they explicitly set `nested` to true. The nested run then get stacked on top of the parent run (as in the child run becomes the active run, and the active run ID reverts back to parent once the child run completes). My PR will ensure the MLflow R client performs the same type of client-side book-keeping the MLflow Python client does.\r\n\r\n@dmatrix I think https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3537 implements precisely what's described here.
