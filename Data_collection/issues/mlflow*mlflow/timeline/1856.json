So far, the main use cases I'm aware of are finding/referencing `mlflow server` processes and stopping said processes (not sure what use case for the `--pause` functionality is)\r\n* Write a design proposal outlining the new `mlflow server` commands and their behavior/arguments in a bit more detail (for example, one thing I'm not sure of is whether `click`, the Python CLI library we use, supports having both `mlflow server` and `mlflow server stop` commands, where one command is a prefix of another command). All new commands should be motivated by use cases from the previous step.\r\n* Actually open, review, & merge a PR\r\n\r\nWould be happy to review/provide feedback during each of the above steps :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/657382634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3538135821,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUzODEzNTgyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3538135821","actor":{"login":"SkyWaffles","id":5054893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTQ4OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5054893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles","html_url":"https://github.com/SkyWaffles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T06:21:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3538135825,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MzgxMzU4MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3538135825","actor":{"login":"SkyWaffles","id":5054893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTQ4OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5054893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles","html_url":"https://github.com/SkyWaffles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWaffles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T06:21:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/657382939","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1856#issuecomment-657382939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1856","id":657382939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzM4MjkzOQ==","user":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T06:22:13Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T06:22:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Applying
