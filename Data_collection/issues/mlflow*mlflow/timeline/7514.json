thoughts:\r\n\r\nIf adding the feature you suggested, to make the retrieving all unique experiment tags efficient, we need to maintain a separate table that stores the full tag key list across all runs / experiments, when adding a new tag , we updates the table. This still brings overhead and increase code complexity.\r\n\r\nAnother option is, you can implement tag autocomplete in upper layer software. In upper layer software, you can pre-define a tag key list that should be used, and generating autocomplete hint from the pre-defined tag key list.
