@dbczumar, @BenWilson2  , \r\nwe would like to create an `mlflow` interface to `sktime`, which also contains an interface to `statsforecast` and many other time series packages. We have an open issue and there are people who want to work on it now: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1215\r\n\r\nQuestion regarding this:\r\n> While we are not currently accepting contributions of new MLflow Model flavors for forecasting in the main MLflow repository, we would be happy to provide guidance for implementing this feature as a third-party package / repository. \r\n\r\nis this also valid for `sktime` or only for packages that implement a particular model? `sktime` is a whole framework and not just a particular model/algo. If you dont want us to contribute to `mlflow`, I think we could implement the interface also directly in `sktime` if I am not wrong? Having an interface between `mlflow` and `sktime` would superseed this issue and existing interfaces to `pmdarima` and `prophet`, as all 3 packages are interfaced in `sktime` with a unified `sklearn`-like
