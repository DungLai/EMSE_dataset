Adding the `allow-same-origin` attribute allows the iframed content to make requests [without automatically failing the same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox), which in turn allows GET & POST requests to be made from the iframed HTML to my local MLflow server (these requests would otherwise fail as the local server doesn't allow CORS)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/558515226/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2830924100,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgzMDkyNDEwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2830924100","actor":{"login":"patryk-oleniuk","id":6854491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTQ0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6854491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk","html_url":"https://github.com/patryk-oleniuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-26T08:20:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2830924114,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4MzA5MjQxMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2830924114","actor":{"login":"patryk-oleniuk","id":6854491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTQ0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6854491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk","html_url":"https://github.com/patryk-oleniuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patryk-oleniuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-26T08:20:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/558515802","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2139#issuecomment-558515802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2139","id":558515802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODUxNTgwMg==","user":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T08:21:37Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T08:21:37Z","author_assoc
