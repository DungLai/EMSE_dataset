Is it possible to reproduce this issue using newer versions of MLflow (e.g. MLflow 1.7.0)? The code path you linked hasn't changed, so I'd guess the answer is yes (but if upgrading fixes your issue, that'd also be great to know). Assuming the bug is still present in the most recent release, would you be interested in filing a PR with a fix? Seems the right fix is to ensure Sagemaker fetches the model from the appropriate bucket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/599313125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3131370096,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEzMTM3MDA5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3131370096","actor":{"login":"Tradunsky","id":4522842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjI4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4522842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky","html_url":"https://github.com/Tradunsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-16T02:43:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3131370098,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMzEzNzAwOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3131370098","actor":{"login":"Tradunsky","id":4522842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjI4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4522842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky","html_url":"https://github.com/Tradunsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-16T02:43:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3131370314,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzMTMxMzcwMzE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3131370314","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-16T02:43:21Z","assignee":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url"
