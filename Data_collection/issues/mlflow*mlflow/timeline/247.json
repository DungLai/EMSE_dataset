Is that right or am I missing something? In the extreme case, imagine you wanted to `mlflow run` a project that someone else wrote that's on GitHub, where you don't even want to change the code, but you still want it to access S3 using your preferred auth process.\r\n\r\nTo enable this, I'd prefer if all these options could be set in environment variables or config files outside the MLflow project and picked up that way. In that case we could have these `kw_args` in the internal API or we could just have each artifact store pick up its own config in its own way. For example, for the S3 store, we could add some extension point that lets it pick up a key provider Python objects; then users would set some environment variable, say MLFLOW_S3_KEY_PROVIDER=mycode.mypythonmodule, and it would call into that. You could then use it without modifying the MLflow clients calling log_artifact.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/412147783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/412350831","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/247#issuecomment-412350831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/247","id":412350831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjM1MDgzMQ==","user":{"login":"InspiredIdealist","id":3386761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODY3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3386761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist","html_url":"https://github.com/InspiredIdealist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InspiredIdealist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-12T15:35:22Z","updated_at":"2018-08-12T15:35:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That's a really good point.
