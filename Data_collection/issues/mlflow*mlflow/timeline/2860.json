For downloading artifacts, we recommend using the `mlflow.tracking.client.MlflowClient.download_artifacts` API ([see docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html#mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient.download_artifacts)), to which you can directly supply the run ID & the path of the artifact within the run. For example, here's a code snippet you can use to log & download artifacts for a run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking.client import MlflowClient\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as active_run:\r\n     run_id = active_run.info.run_id\r\n     # Log the artifact under the current active run. By default, the\r\n     # artifact will be logged to the root artifact path within the run\r\n     mlflow.log_artifact(\"/path/to/artifact/hi.txt\")\r\n\r\nclient = MlflowClient() \r\nlocal_dir_containing_artifact = client.download_artifacts(run_id, \"hi.txt\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if that works,
