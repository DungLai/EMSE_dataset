Sorry it's been a while since you filed this issue. Have you checked out our more recent MLflow UI? There's feature to compare multiple runs, and you can sort by metrics to help you classify what might be a \"good\" run. \r\n\r\nIf you're still interested in this feature, can you describe the use case in more detail? What types of metrics are you trying to compare? What type of sparkline do you think would help here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/515604249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"max-allen-db","id":51378244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzc4MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51378244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db","html_url":"https://github.com/max-allen-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2513745438,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxMzc0NTQzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513745438","actor":{"login":"hamroune","id":795761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune","html_url":"https://github.com/hamroune","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:25:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2513745440,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTM3NDU0NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513745440","actor":{"login":"hamroune","id":795761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune","html_url":"https://github.com/hamroune","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:25:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2513746144,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1MTM3NDYxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513746144","actor":{"login":"max-allen-db","id":51378244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzc4MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51378244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db","html_url":"https://github.com/max-allen-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-allen-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:26:02Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/595994968","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/406#issuec
