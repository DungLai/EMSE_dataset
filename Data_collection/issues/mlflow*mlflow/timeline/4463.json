@smurching \r\n\r\nBased on the databricks example of https://docs.databricks.com/_static/notebooks/deep-learning/horovod-spark-estimator-keras.html，\r\nWe add the MLflow integration.\r\nWe have successfully registered model to MLflow with below code\r\n```\r\nkeras_model = keras_estimator.fit(train_df).setOutputCols(['label_prob'])\r\nregmodel.keras_model.getModel()\r\nmlflow.keras.log_model(regmodel, \"Keras-Sequential-model\", registered_model_name=\"Keras-Sequential-model-reg\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when we loaded model from MLflow to predict  Spark DataFrame, need other arguments: floatx, metadata.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel_uri = \"models:/Keras-Sequential-model-reg/1\"\r\nloaded_model = mlflow.keras.load_model(model_uri)\r\n\r\n\r\nmetadata = keras_model._get_metadata()\r\nfloatx = keras_model._get_floatx()\r\nkeras_model_from_reg = hvd.KerasModel(model=loaded_model,\r\n                                      feature_columns=['features'],\r\n

needed  \"floatx, metadata\" to log_model and save them with the model. \r\n\r\nAnother point I’m not sure is:  Whether the two \"floatx, metadata\" kwargs  can be loaded out  from  MLflow when using mlflow.keras.load_model API.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/863915794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhixingheyi-tian","id":41657774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41657774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhixingheyi-tian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhixingheyi-tian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4908891807,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDkwODg5MTgwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4908891807","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-18T09:55:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4908891809,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5MDg4OTE4MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4908891809","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-18T09:55:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4908891812,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDkwODg5MTgxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4908891812","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-18T09:55:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4908891820,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5MDg4OTE4MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4908891820","actor":{"

updates on the same? I am facing a similar issue but I am using Pytorch. \r\n\r\nI have save my pytorch model (along with transforms) as a `PythonFunction`. I want to load the model in CPU as well as GPU. Is there any provision of passing extra arguments like `use_gpu=True` while logging the model. Ideally, I want to use this extra argument to during `load_model` to load the model in CPU or GPU.  \r\n\r\nI found a similar issue (#4443) for spacy model.
