@WeichenXu123 thanks for taking a look -\r\n\r\n> This might cause an issue if the model contains a transformer that takes a timestamp column and converts it to some numeric columns.\r\n\r\nTo confirm my understanding, are you saying this might cause an issue because the timestamp (`\"2017-01-01 12:00:00\"`) would then be deserialized as a string rather than a timestamp, and so the model might not be able to perform inference on it? I wonder (but not sure) if this could be solved by adding logic in the inference server to deserialize timestamp types, as I think @WeichenXu123 is suggesting above. How do people usually get around this issue when working with
