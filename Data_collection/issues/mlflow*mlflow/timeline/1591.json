I'd love to discuss how we can help make your use case better supported - correct me if I'm wrong, but you're saying that putting a tag on the run is inconvenient because: (1) it means that when you start your classification run, you have to load the parameters that you used to generate the dataset and (2) the tags would become cluttered in the UI because you have several parameters.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that option 2 makes the most sense to me - logically, each new dataset that you're working with should warrant a new experiment and multiple runs under that. Is the biggest problem that you can't add notes and tags to experiments? We're scoping out how we can actually support that kind of use case. What do you mean by you can't use it as intended?\r\n\r\nFor option 3, you can specify a parent run explicitly when you do `with mlflow.start_run`. How do you feel about that kind of solution?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/511968662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2487376979,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI0ODczNzY5Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2487376979","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-16T20:20:20Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/511995462","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1591#issuecomment-511995462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1591","id":511995462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTk5NTQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"ptoews","id":1062119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjIxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1062119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews","html_url":"https://github.com/ptoews","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T21:30:33Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T21:30:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, it seems very awkward to load all the parameters that were used for feature file generation and attach them to the separate second process. Also it would be difficult to compare all classification runs executed with the same dataset (by querying all params individually).\r\n\r\nIn general it makes probably a lot of sense to have an experiment per dataset. But here, the feature file is dependent on a chosen dataset as well as chosen feature extraction methods. I would love to be able to compare the performance of the whole pipeline by just modifying e.g. one parameter in the feature extraction step. This would be really cumbersome with multiple experiments.\r\nWhat I mean with not being able to use it as intended is the missing possibility to use experiments to completely separate runs, e.g. for testing very different strategies or whatever, because I would already be \"abusing\" the experiments feature to separate datasets.\r\n\r\nI tried to specify a parent run as you suggested and made it work like this:\r\n1. use `mlflow.start_run(parent_run_id)` to \"continue\" the parent run\r\n2. use `mlflow.start_run(nested=True)` no start a nested run with the current run as parent\r\n\r\nIs this the proper way to do this? Because I could not find it in the documentation.\r\nHowever as far as I can tell this is pretty much what I was looking for. I'll see if I miss something, thank you already!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/511995462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ptoews","id":1062119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjIxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1062119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews","html_url":"https://github.com/ptoews","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoews/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/513928986","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1591#issuecomment-513928986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1591","id":513928986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzkyODk4Ng==","user":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T19:51:43Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T19:51:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yeah that seems reasonable - we should work on documenting it better, but for the time being, our blog post on the feature release has an example that might help!
