Thanks for filling this FR. Sorry for the delayed response. I think having a global parameter that is honored across all\r\nentry points within a project make sense, especially if the parameter is employed across all entry points.\r\n\r\nThe order of precedence comes to mind as a way to honor the scope and its use. \r\n\r\n1. Would it make sense to call the key global_parameter?\r\n2. Can you have more than one global_parameter?\r\n3. Which takes precedence when you provide command-line arg as -P <global_key> when both global_key is defined as both global_parameter and in the entry point?\r\n\r\n@smurching @harupy @juntai-zheng as

there any updates on this feature? I'd be interested, too. I could also help implementing it, if someone needs help or I could start with an implementation. But I think we'd have to answer the questions of @dmatrix first.\r\n1. My personal preference would be to call the global parameters simply `parameters` as originally proposed as that would make the link to the individual parameters clear.\r\n2. You mean whether it's possible to have multiple parameters defined inside the global parameters? I'd say yes.\r\n3. My suggestion would be to first process the global parameters and their defaults, update using the parameters defined on the entrypoints and then use what's given on the command line.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1005510822/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"florianblume","id":2170192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzAxOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2170192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume","html_url":"https://github.com/florianblume","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianblume/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5845155695,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx84sJtdSzwAAAAFcZf9v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5845155695","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-05T09:18:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5845155713,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx84sJtdSzwAAAAFcZf-B","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5845155713","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-05T09:18:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
