We actually run our tests on Windows via Travis CI, so it's surprising to hear that run creation is broken.\r\n\r\nAssuming `pip install gunicorn` works on Windows, the only benefit I think we get from removing gunicorn is dependency & package-size reduction. Gunicorn itself is a pretty small dependency ([~112Kb](https://pypi.org/project/gunicorn/#files)) and [only depends on setuptools](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/setup.py), so I'm not if we gain much on these
