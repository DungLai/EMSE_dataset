@samgd , assuming that you're referring to Docker containers in the context of MLflow Projects, the `docker_env` attribute of your MLproject configuration file supports a list of mounts that can be used to provide access to your large files / data within the Docker container, without the need for copying. Each mount point is exposed to the container using the `docker run -v` flag. More information can be found in the MLflow docs: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#specifying-an-environment, and here's an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker_env:\r\n  image: mlflow-docker-example-environment\r\n  volumes: [\"/local/path:/container/mount/path\"]\r\n  environment: [[\"NEW_ENV_VAR\", \"new_var_value\"], \"VAR_TO_COPY_FROM_HOST_ENVIRONMENT\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm going to go ahead and close this issue, since it appears that this functionality is already supported.
