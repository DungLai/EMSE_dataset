Below is my first attempt at a design.  Feedback would be appreciated.  Thanks.\r\n\r\n# Expected Behavior\r\n1. Users are able to optionally add docker or conda environments ('conda_env:' or 'docker_env:') within individual entry points, inside an MLProject file.\r\n\r\nDocker Example \r\n\r\nMLProject:\r\n```yml\r\nname: docker-example\r\n\r\ndocker_env:\r\n  image:  mlflow-docker-example\r\n\r\nentry_points:\r\n  main:\r\n    parameters:\r\n      alpha: float\r\n      l1_ratio: {type: float, default: 0.1}\r\n    command: \"python train.py --alpha {alpha} --l1-ratio {l1_ratio}\"\r\n  tf2_training:\r\n    docker_env:\r\n      image: docker-tf2\r\n    parameters:\r\n      alpha: float\r\n      l1_ratio: {type: float, default: 0.1}\r\n    command: \"python train.py --alpha {alpha} --l1-ratio {l1_ratio}\"\r\n```\r\nConda Example\r\n\r\nMLProject:\r\n```yml\r\nname: My Project\r\n\r\nconda_env: my_env.yaml\r\n\r\nentry_points:\r\n  main:\r\n    parameters:\r\n      data_file: path\r\n      regularization: {type: float, default: 0.1}\r\n    command: \"python train.py -r {regularization} {data_file}\"\r\n  validate:\r\n    conda_env: validate_env.yaml\r\n    parameters:\r\n      data_file: path\r\n    command: \"python validate.py {data_file}\"\r\n```\r\n2. If specified, the local entry point environment takes precedence over the project level environment.  If not specified, the project level environment is used.\r\n\r\n3. Entry point environments are validated in the same way as project level environments and the same rules apply.\r\n\r\n4. Mixed use of conda and docker entry point environments within the same MLProject file is allowed as long as only one environment is specified per entry point.  Multiple environments per entry point (or at the project level) will raise an error.\r\n\r\n5. The 'use_conda' parameter applies to both environments (project level and entry point level).\r\n\r\n6. The only way to specify an entry point environment is within a MLProject file.  \r\n\r\n# Proposed code changes\r\n1. [EntryPoint class in _project_spec.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/88858b529bc1b49f37a4a3e7087649f85e62bf1a/mlflow/projects/_project_spec.py#L118) - add self.conda_env_path and self.docker_env instance variables, with None default values\r\n\r\n2. [load_project() in _project_spec.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/88858b529bc1b49f37a4a3e7087649f85e62bf1a/mlflow/projects/_project_spec.py#L27) - parse 'docker_env' and 'conda_env' from entry points and set according to Project level values if not specified.  Validate entry points using existing code within load_project.  May require refactoring existing code into isolated functions: validate_docker_env() and validate_conda_path().  Include the appropriate 'docker_env' and 'conda_env' values as arguments in call to EntryPoint(). \r\n\r\n3. [Project class in _project_spec.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/88858b529bc1b49f37a4a3e7087649f85e62bf1a/mlflow/projects/_project_spec.py#L91) - modify get_entry_point() method, so that the returned entry point object has appropriate conda_env_path and docker_env variables set, taken from Project level setting if not specified at entry point level.  \r\n\r\n4. [_run() in projects/__init__.py ](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/88858b529bc1b49f37a4a3e7087649f85e62bf1a/mlflow/projects/__init__.py#L86) - set docker_env and conda_path from the entry point instead of the project\r\n```python\r\nproject = load_project(work_dir)\r\nentry_point_object = project.get_entry_point(entry_point)\r\ndocker_env = entry_point_object.docker_env\r\nconda_env_path = entry_point.conda_env_path\r\n```  \r\nreplace all references to 'project.docker_env' with 'docker_env' and all references to 'project.conda_path' with 'conda_env_path' \r\n\r\n5. [_validate_execution_environment() in projects/__init__.py ](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/88858b529bc1b49f37a4a3e7087649f85e62bf1a/mlflow/projects/__init__.py#L507) - change input argument from 'project' to 'entry_point'.  Check 'entry_point.docker_env' instead of 'project.docker_env'.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Proposed test changes\r\n1. add a new entry point to [tests/resources/example_project](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7bccdaaa704efbb2d687e592e5de6a9809c16dbc/tests/resources/example_project/MLproject) - called 'entry_point_env' with appropriate syntax for an entry point level conda environment\r\n2. add a new entry point to [tests/resources/example_docker_project](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7bccdaaa704efbb2d687e592e5de6a9809c16dbc/tests/resources/example_docker_project/MLproject) - called 'entry_point_env' with appropriate syntax for an entry point level docker environment\r\n3. updates to existing tests and appropriate new tests, primarily in tests/projects/\r\n\r\n# Proposed doc changes\r\nA short note in the section [Specifying an Environment](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/d92920018ce73a37ef1b716bd05f36a90dc0fd59/docs/source/projects.rst#specifying-an-environment), that the same top-level entries can be optionally specified within an entry point in order to customize the environment for a specific entry point.\r\n\r\n# Potential downsides / complexities\r\nThis feature could increase the likelihood of incompatibilities between entry points.  For example, if two entry points use different versions of pandas, errors are likely to occur if one entry point tries to read an artifact generated by the other.  This risk can be reduced through good documentation and also keeping the project level environment specification as the preferred option.  Entry point level environments should be considered an advanced feature.
