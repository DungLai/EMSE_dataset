The file store is quite limited in functionality compared to the database backends. For example, it does not support the model registry. It is also generally not as performant.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I would expect that most users who need runs to be stored on a cloud service would be best served by using a database backend. And as you point out, running the FileStore from a file system accessed by multiple users (eg GCS) can cause conflicts.  Avoiding these conflicts involves a non-trivial amount of work.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue for now, but please feel free to re-open it if I'm overlooking something.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/707468987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3869156103,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg2OTE1NjEwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3869156103","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T03:55:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3869156108,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg2OTE1NjEwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3869156108","actor":{"login":"Matts966","id":28551465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTUxNDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28551465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966","html_url":"https://github.com/Matts966","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T03:55:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3869156109,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4NjkxNTYxMDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3869156109","actor":{"login":"Matts966","id":28551465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTUxNDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28551465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966","html_url":"https://github.com/Matts966","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matts966/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T03:55:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
