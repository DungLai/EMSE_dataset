noticed that multi-level nesting is supported, but that the UI will flatten the second layer onwards in the list view.  I'm guessing this is by design.\r\n\r\nIf we have periodic training runs, and each run has e.g. one model per product category, I was deciding whether to nest this as `experiment / product_category / run_date` or as `experiment / run_date / product_category`...\r\n\r\nBut after remembering that the UI provides the ability to filter+order by parameters, I realise the multi-level nesting doesn't matter much.  Would you be open to a feature-request / PR adding Kibana-style one-click filtering?  So clicking a button next to some `value` in `column` would append a filter for `... [AND] column = value`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/693297116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"battlesnake","id":4949354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDkzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4949354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake","html_url":"https://github.com/battlesnake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3772328888,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzc3MjMyODg4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3772328888","actor":{"login":"battlesnake","id":4949354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDkzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4949354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake","html_url":"https://github.com/battlesnake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/battlesnake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-16T09:46:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
