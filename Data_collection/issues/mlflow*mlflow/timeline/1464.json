thread, some thoughts\r\n\r\n@smurching don't think much make sense to force experiments as projects, feels like a hack & we lose the most natural aggregation (experiment)? we need another level I think (could be a hierarchical workspace/folder string, something like that, btw-what does databricks use?).\r\n\r\nwe're tending to single mlflow backend per project/initiative because we can't filter the UI by project easily and by default \r\n\r\n@kaleko although global view seems interesting maybe we could deep dive a little bit on actual benefits/scenarios? Comparing runs between projects doesnt make much sense, I see some value on comparing stats (ex: nÂº runs, by whom, last run, etc) between projects, but that prob can be better handled by a BI tool after extracting run/exp info from all stores? Or only having a single starting home page?\r\n\r\nHaving a single backend/tracking server though would make things easier for maintenance and hosting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/515720102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rquintino","id":10835742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10835742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino","html_url":"https://github.com/rquintino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2514458668,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxNDQ1ODY2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2514458668","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-27T23:19:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2514458669,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTQ0NTg2Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2514458669","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-27T23:19:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2514458670,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxNDQ1ODY3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2514458670","actor":{"login":"kaleko","id":5712203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTIyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5712203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko","html_url":"https://github.com/kaleko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-27T23:19:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2514458671,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTQ0NTg2NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2514458671","actor":{"login":"kaleko","id":5712203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTIyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avata

I think the natural structure is people work on different projects, each project has a number of different experiments in it, and each experiment may consist of a number of different runs. For an example, a project might be \"classifying images that have cats in them\", an experiment might be \"trying to preprocess the image before inference\", and runs might be \"compressing the image\", \"blurring the image\", \"increasing contrast in the image\", etc.\r\n\r\n@rquintino For me, the main benefit would be in only having to host a single mlflow server. Each time I create a new one, I have to provision a machine, install packages, download docker, pull docker image, etc. I would prefer to have one server that everyone uses, everyone shares the same access credentials, and if someone changes and wants to spawn off a new project, they can do so without having to go to an admin and ask for a new mlflow server.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/516140963/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kaleko","id":5712203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTIyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5712203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko","html_url":"https://github.com/kaleko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2517655589,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxNzY1NTU4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2517655589","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T20:02:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2517655591,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTc2NTU1OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2517655591","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T20:02:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2517655596,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxNzY1NTU5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2517655596","actor":{"login":"rquintino","id":10835742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10835742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino","html_url":"https://github.com/rquintino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T20:02:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2517655597,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTc2NTU1OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2517655597","actor":{"login":"rquintino","id":10835742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubus
