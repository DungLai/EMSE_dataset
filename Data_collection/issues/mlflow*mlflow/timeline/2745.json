Use boto3 sagemaker API, it has more flexibility than sagemaker sdk, and it doesn’t require to bring in sagemaker pkg as dependency.\r\n2. Add transform() in mlflow.sagemaker.cli.py, which calls a new transform() in mlflow.sagemaker.__init__.py, which will create a model first and then call a new _create_sagemaker_transform_job() to create the transform job against this model, then if synchronous is set, it will continuously check the status until finish or timeout. it will reuse existing and add new help function to do these work. \r\n3.
