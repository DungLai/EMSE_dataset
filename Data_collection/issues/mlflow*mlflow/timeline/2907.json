I am also interested in this use case. To be a bit more specific, I am looking for a method with an interface similar to\r\n\r\n```python\r\nget_metrics_for_run(run_uuid: str, metrics: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> pandas.DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturning a dataframe (in long-format) with columns `timestamp, step, metric, value` comprising all metric values logged throughout a run.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, it may be interesting to retrieve these dataframes for all runs associated with an experiment, returning a dataframe with an additional `run_uuid` column, which can be joined with the dataframe containing the runs' parameters, e.g. obtained from `mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=experiment_id)`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nget_metrics_for_experiment(experiment_uuid: str, metrics: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> pandas.DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nProviding the metrics of interest beforehand allows more efficient backend operations than first retrieving all metrics and then filtering on the resulting dataframe.\r\n\r\nHaving access to this data allows for instance analysing training progress similar to what is shown here ( https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2768#issuecomment-621568259 )
