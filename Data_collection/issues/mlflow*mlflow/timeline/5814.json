The reason we do not remove files immediately after they are read into memory is that it's hard to determine whether or not the API used to load the files into memory might try to access them later; for example, some frameworks incrementally read model contents from a directory of files as needed.\r\n\r\nIf you want to control removal of these files, we recommend first downloading them via `mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts()` and cleaning up the returned path when you're done using them.
