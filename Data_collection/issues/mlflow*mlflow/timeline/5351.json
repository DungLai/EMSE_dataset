Specifically the ModelCheckpoint callback, like this:from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint\r\n#Create instance of ModelCheckpoint\r\nchk = ModelCheckpoint(\"myModel.h5\", monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=False)\r\n#add that callback to the list of callbacks to pass\r\ncallbacks_list = [chk]\r\n#create your model\r\nmodel_tt = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model, nb_epoch=150, batch_size=10)\r\n#fit your model with your data. Pass the callback(s) here\r\nmodel_tt.fit(X_train,y_train, callbacks=callbacks_list)\r\nThis will save your training each epoch to the myModel.h5 file. This provides great benefits, as you are able to stop your training when you desire (like when you see it has started to overfit), and still retain the previous training.\r\n\r\nNote that this saves both the structure and weights in the same hdf5 file (as showed by Zach), so you can then load you model using keras.models.load_model.\r\n\r\nIf you want to save only your weights separately, you can then use the save_weights_only=True argument when instantiating your ModelCheckpoint","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1056776743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pat749","id":81972829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTcyODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81972829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749","html_url":"https://github.com/pat749","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1056777653","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5351#issuecomment-1056777653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5351","id":1056777653,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx84-_SW1","user":{"login":"pat749","id":81972829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTcyODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81972829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749","html_url":"https://github.com/pat749","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-02T10:42:30Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T10:42:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"for more explanation you can see https://keras.io/api/callbacks/ this documentation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1056777653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pat749","id":81972829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTcyODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81972829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749","html_url":"https://github.com/pat749","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pat749/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
