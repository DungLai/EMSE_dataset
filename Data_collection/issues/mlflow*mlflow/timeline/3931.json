For [prompt-based NLG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering), _prompts_ (strings, often long ones) are hyper-parameters that are central to model performances, alongside other numerical/boolean parameters.\r\n\r\nFor now, my team and I are logging these prompts as artifacts. However, doing so lessens the relevance of the MLFlow Tracking UI since we cannot use those of the UI's components designed to spot the relevant hyperparameter values. More generally, storing some parameters as `parameter`, and some as `artifact`, necessarily complexifies codebases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1120894458/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xavierfontaine","id":12429906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI5OTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12429906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierfontaine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfontaine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1219999039","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3931#issuecomment-1219999039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3931","id":1219999039,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85It7U_","user":{"login":"jinzhang21","id":78067366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDY3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78067366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21","html_url":"https://github.com/jinzhang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-18T21:46:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T21:46:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@xavierfontaine
