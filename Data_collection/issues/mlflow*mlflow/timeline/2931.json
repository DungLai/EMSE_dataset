, I'm sorry for the very late response. I lost track of this, but did have some time to discuss this with another committer.\r\n\r\nSome proposals for the behavior:\r\n(1) The truncation behavior should be controlled by a flag, to avoid breaking existing workflows that depend on intact tags. For some workflows, it is better to fail early than to write an incomplete tag.\r\n\r\n(2) Related to (1), this truncation logic should not apply for [system tags](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/utils/mlflow_tags.py). These have special purposes and truncating them could break invariants.\r\n\r\n(3) We should issue a warning when a tag is truncated so the user's aware of this\r\n\r\nRegarding the specific implementations: I think this should apply for all tags, not just model version tags. Based on the logic in `validation.py`, I believe the list of tag classes we have are:\r\n- ExperimentTag\r\n- RunTag\r\n- RegisteredModelTag\r\n\r\nI think we should have the same behavior for all of these flags. To do this, we should update the logic in our validation functions (`_validate_tag`, `_validate_experiment_tag`, `_validate_registered_model_tag`, `_validate_model_version_tag`) to truncate the tag value. To implement this, we might want to update these functions to take one of the above tag objects and update the `value` property. If we do that, we should also rename the functions to indicate that the input may be mutated, maybe something like
