should NEVER require any exact versions of dependencies. They are build blocks which are used by other applications, and setting up fixed dependency versions will be really painful.\r\n\r\nFor example, you've discovered that 1.0.0 version of `mylib-abc` is causing some issues, and mlflow is using the same dependency.\r\nIn case when dependency version is not fixed in mlflow, you can easily upgrade it to 1.1.0 or downgrade it to 0.9 because pip will resolve for the most suitable version for all the requirements you're using.\r\nBut if mlflow has dependency restriction like `mylib==1.0.0`, pip will return an error that some packages are not compatible. And there just is nothing you can do to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nLibraries should declare version restrictions only if there are some features or bugfixes which are REALLY affect the way how mlflow is working. And these restriction should be flexible enough.\r\nFor example, if mlflow is depending on some feature in `mylib-abc` which was added only in 1.2.0, mlflow should declare restriction like `mylib-abc>=1.2.0`.\r\nIf some required behavior was broken in `mylib-abc` 2.0.0 and newer versions, this restriction should look like `mylib-abc<2.0`.\r\n\r\nIn your case, if your application is depending on both mlflow and Flask ,but Flask 2.0 is has some breaking changes which are not compatible with your source code, this application should declare dependencies like:\r\n```\r\nmlflow\r\nFlask<2.0\r\n```\r\nor even something like that to get more reproducible builds:\r\n```\r\nmlflow==1.17.2\r\nFlask==1.1.4\r\n```\r\nmlflow itself should not declare such restrictions because it is perfectly working on Flask 2.0 (see #4350).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/841186838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dolfinus","id":4661021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjEwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4661021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus","html_url":"https://github.com/dolfinus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolfinus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
