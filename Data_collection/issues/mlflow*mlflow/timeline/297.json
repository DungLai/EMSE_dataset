The other issue with Protobufs is that if we expose them in the public API, we might never be able to get rid of them without a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\nRegarding `mlflow` vs `mlflow.tracking`, the original idea was to alias some very commonly used functions in `mlflow` but have everything else in `mlflow.tracking`.

from an API-centric background I believe having a low-level client that faithfully mirrors the actual HTTP calls is crucial. This client is the building block on top of which richer more domain-specific clients can be built. A low-level and language-oriented client are just ends of a continuum and not mutually exclusive. So the boto paradigm seems like a good one. Low-level API clients are easy to create. Furthermore, designing only an opinionated client can be problematic since other users will have different unanticipated needs. \r\n\r\nI see the MLflow REST API as a foundational core feature on top of which different clients and applications can be built. A high-level API and multi-lingual client strategy is important to building out MLflow as a powerful next-gen ML management platform. I could see someone wanting to create their own custom UI for hyperparameter optimization that would be written on top of the API. Or create a custom rich client that would be tailored to their specific use cases. This would be in line with the today’s ubiquitous rich API ecosystem where businesses expose APIs and customers create value-add with client applications. A good read on the topic: [APIs: A Strategy Guide](https://www.amazon.com/APIs-Strategy-Application-Programming-Interfaces/dp/1449308929).\r\n\r\nHere's a sample low-level Python MLflow client [mlflow_client/mlflow_api_client.py](https://github.com/amesar/mlflow-python-client/blob/master/mlflow_client/mlflow_api_client.py) that is similar to the Java client API. It is slightly opinionated in that it rolls out nested JSON responses and simplifies the search input signature.\r\n\r\nI would also certainly add CRUD capabilities to API resources so folks can more effectively manage (update, delete) their experiments and runs. A richer domain model would be helpful in being able to group experiments into \"buckets\". Let's say a company wants to group one set of experiments into \"self-driving-cars\" and another into \"self-driving-trucks\".  Having a flat experiment name space won't scale when you have many experiments.\r\n\r\nAn autogenerated API sounds good but I would shy away from exposing Protobuf concepts. Protobuf data concepts have already leaked into the  current REST data payloads (e.g. unnecessary wrapper fields such as in the “create run” response where the data is buried two-levels down in “run/info”). Protobuf is an internal implementation detail - the API should only expose RESTful concepts.\r\n\r\nThe current API also uses RPC-like endpoints such as “experiments/list”, “experiments/get”, etc. instead of standard HTTP/REST verbs and resource names. A more RESTful API would look like:\r\n\r\n|Current |    |  Proposed  |  ' \r\n------------ | -------------|--|--\r\n**Method** | **Endpoint** | **Method** | **Endpoint**\r\nGET | experiments/list | GET | experiments\r\nGET |  experiments/get?experiment_id=$EXP_ID | GET | experiments/$EXP_ID\r\nPOST |  experiments/create| POST| experiments\r\nGET |  runs/run_uuid=$RUN_ID |  GET | runs/$RUN_ID \r\nPOST|  runs/create| POST| runs \r\nPOST|  runs/update| PUT (PATCH?)| runs/$RUN_ID |\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/413976600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andremesarovic","id":32520302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTIwMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32520302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic","html_url":"https://github.com/andremesarovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremesarovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415134763","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/297#issuecomment-415134763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/297","id":415134763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTEzNDc2Mw==","user":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-22T18:35:15Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T18:35:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You raise a few distinct points. Let me try to summarize them to make sure I understand each.\r\n\r\nPython API proposal\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe proposed [API here](https://github.com/amesar/mlflow-python-client/blob/master/mlflow_client/mlflow_api_client.py) looks pretty similar to the one introduced in #299 . The key differences I see are\r\n  1. The proposed API returns raw JSON objects as opposed to the Python `mlflow.entities`. The entities provide some significant utility, I think -- mainly that users can call `help()` or use IPython's autocomplete on them, and that Python errors are thrown if you attempt to access a field that could not possibly be defined, to help prevent typos in user code.\r\n  2. You introduce an easier-to-use search API. I think this makes sense, as the current one with `experiment_ids` and `anded_expressions` is difficult to reason about and construct. I think we may want to introduce this API at the REST level, though, because the REST APIs should be easy to construct by hand.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I am missing some other major differences between the proposed API and the one in #299.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUD-y REST API\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nYou point out that our current REST API does not follow the RESTful ideals as well as it could, and you're absolutely right. The reason we originally designed the REST API as we did was simply because we happened to have infrastructure and tooling to take protos and convert them into REST API constructs, but this infrastructure has the limitation where it cannot support the RESTful ideal. So, we were constrained to using GET with query parameters and POST with JSON bodies for input.\r\n\r\nAlthough our API should not be in principal constrained by the existing technology and tooling we have, it is the case that it is still significant effort to convert and handle the APIs on all available servers to a more RESTful ideal. For this reason, I am still in favor of keeping the straightforward-but-not-completely-RESTful API. We can definitely introduce the more RESTful terminology later in a v2 API, and continue to support both.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415134763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
