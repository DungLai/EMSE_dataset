Either directly locally or against an mlflow server (that too can run locally, but can be also elsewhere). \r\n\r\n__Local Tracking__\r\nYou simply start tracking in your Python code with `mlflow.start_run()`. To inspect the tracked items, you then launch MLflow UI separately from (CDSW) terminal. You can launch it before, during or after tracking.  In CDSW, it needs to be launched to listen on `0.0.0.0` and on a specific port (typically `8080`; see [CDSW documentation](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/data-science-workbench/1-6-x/topics/cdsw_embedded_web_apps.html#ml_frameworks) and inspect the corresponding environmental variables in your installation). When launched, you can see the UI from outside CDSW at `http://<$CDSW_ENGINE_ID>.<$CDSW_DOMAIN>` (or perhaps something else depending on your setup).\r\n\r\nSince #2176 added  `host` option back to MLflow UI, launching it in CDSW should be as easy as running `mlflow ui -p 8080 -h 0.0.0.0` in CDSW terminal (but see the note below). \r\n\r\n(In older versions `127.0.0.1` was hardcoded in [mlflow/cli.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/cli.py) in a call to `_run_server()`, so I needed to change it to `0.0.0.0` in `cli.py` inside my mlflow installation)\r\n\r\n__Tracking against an mlflow server__\r\nYou first launch a server and then track against it. I launch server locally within my CDSW session's terminal with e.g. `mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow_tracking_server.db  --default-artifact-root file:///path/to/mflow_bucket/ \r\n  -p 8080 --host 0.0.0.0`. Once launched, you then \"connect\" to it from Python by setting tracking uri `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\")` before `mlflow.start_run()` . \r\n\r\nServer UI is then again available at `http://<$CDSW_ENGINE_ID>.<$CDSW_DOMAIN>`.\r\n\r\n__(my) Recommendation__\r\nI believe that tracking against a server is a better way as it gives you more flexibility and also more options. It is conceptually cleaner (i.e. you follow client/server model) and it is also the recommended way. So, I would recommend to consider tracking with a server (albeit a local one) instead of a direct local tracking. \r\n\r\n_Note_:\r\nIn my case, I also needed to expand `PATH` to include the directory with gunicorn binary. `pip install mlflow` in my case raises a warning if that needs to be done, so read carefully its output. I have to do it with both alternatives.
