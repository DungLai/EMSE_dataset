This is because artifacts are actually written by the client, which just obtains an artifact location to write to from the tracking server. Instead, we recommend launching your tracking server with ``--default-artifact-root`` set to an artifact location accessible to both the tracking server & the client, e.g. an S3 bucket URI. See the [tracking docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#storage) and [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52331254/how-to-store-artifacts-on-a-server-running-mlflow) for more information.\r\n\r\nAlso one gotcha worth noting from the SO post:\r\n\r\n> Note that the server uses ``--default-artifact-root`` only when assigning artifact roots to newly-created experiments - runs created under existing experiments will use an artifact root directory under the existing experiment's artifact root.\r\n\r\nSo you'll need to create a new experiment for the artifact root change to take place. Thanks all for discussing this, it's come up a few times - I'd suggest these simple changes to make using `log_artifact` smoother:\r\n\r\n* Log a warning when `mlflow server` is run without ``--default-artifact-root`` (and eventually, require `--default-artifact-root`)\r\n* Log the artifact path being used when `log_artifact` is called.

Refer [docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-stores) for for support for various type of artifact store types.\r\n\r\nI'd argue, that there is still no support for uploading artifacts to server side. Like for instance it is available in H2O, which uses separate menu options and/or API functions for remote and local actions (download / upload vs import / save). NFS is not remote if it has to be mounted locally on the client side... One needs yet another server apart from `mlflow server` or else our most important artifacts will be dispersed in local users folders, siloed, passworded, or manually deleted as the `./mflow` folder is not hidden...\r\n\r\nCompared to H2O, where one can upload data to a training server and then download trained models from the server, even using a browser, without any scripting (and without having to set up another server such as NFS), remote storage of artifacts in MLflow Tracking is

> remote storage of artifacts in MLflow Tracking is non-existent.\r\n> \r\n> Is it still true?\r\n\r\nYes, in the sense that an object storage server like minio is needed to perform the storage of artifacts, which must be first saved locally to a temporary folder and then uploaded by the mlflow python client directly to the s3 endpoint. To provide universal storage support neither client nor server have anything to do with minio client (a separate package) or server (a minio container is required as a server and boto3 package dependencies are on both sides: the python client system and the mlflow container). This is a completely opposite design paradigm than in case of H2O: loose coupling / microservices architecture as opposed to bundling all features into a monolithic application. I'm running 4 extra containers to host mlflow on prem (and that's just on server side, not counting python and R client containers), including nginx as a reverse proxy purely for authentication. Compare and contrast with H20, which any 20-year old intern with some basic R could put up and use within minutes... but at the cost of very strict version checking (no official support for backward compatibility of the client with previous versions of the server causes H2O to be really upgrade resistant in production systems and a pain to maintain even in dev environments, where the need to pin H2O at an old version creates dependencies problems for unpinned packages).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/586562932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mirekphd","id":36706320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzA2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36706320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd","html_url":"https://github.com/mirekphd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/651144615","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/572#issuecomment-651144615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/572","id":651144615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTE0NDYxNQ==","user":{"login":"monicatao","id":22206438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjA2NDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22206438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao","html_url":"https://github.com/monicatao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monicatao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-29T14:05:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-29T14:05:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, is there any update for this so far?

Instead, the client (Python MLflow API) is trying to write to the client's local storage with the **path I defined in a docker container**.\r\n\r\nMy `docker-compose.yml` looks like:\r\n```docker-compose\r\nservices:\r\n    db:\r\n        <PostgreSQL set-up>\r\n    web:\r\n        build: mlflow\r\n        restart: always\r\n        image: mlflow_server\r\n        container_name: mlflow_server\r\n        ports:\r\n            - \"5000\":\"5000\"\r\n        depends_on:\r\n            - db\r\n        volumes:\r\n            - ./mlruns:/var/lib/mlflow/mlruns\r\n        command: \"mlflow server\r\n                           --backend-store-url postgresql://...\r\n                           --default-artifact-root /var/lib/mlflow/mlruns\r\n                           --host 0.0.0.0\"\r\n```\r\nEven if I put `file://<remote's IP>/var/lib/mlflow/mlruns` it still tries to write artifacts to the client's `/var/lib/mlflow/mlruns` (for which it doesn't have access).\r\n\r\nNote: I have a simple `Dockerfile` in `<workdir>/mlflow/mlflow`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/742456891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"UnoYakshi","id":5715383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTUzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5715383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi","html_url":"https://github.com/UnoYakshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnoYakshi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/742580890","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/572#issuecomment-742580890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/572","id":742580890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjU4MDg5MA==","user":{"login":"ozichert","id":38570014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTcwMDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38570014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert","html_url":"https://github.com/ozichert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozichert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T15:10:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T16:18:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is how it works on my local machine as NFS variant.
