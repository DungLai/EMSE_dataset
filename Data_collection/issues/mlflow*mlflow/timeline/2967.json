Would be happy to review a PR adding support for this. Note that the current alternative would be to `mlflow run <project-url> -e main.py`, but that workaround is pretty hard to discover & there don't seem to be any negative long-term consequences of making it easy to e.g. `mlflow run https://github.com/yunjey/stargan`. Also agree that main.py is a reasonable default entry point if there's no MLproject file (as you mentioned in offline discussion, it matches the `main` default entry point when there is an MLproject file) - there's also at least one example of a popular project that exposes a main.py (StarGAN), and github search suggests that [other projects do too](https://github.com/search?q=%22main.py%22&type=Repositories).
