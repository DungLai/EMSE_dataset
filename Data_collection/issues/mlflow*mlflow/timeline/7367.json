@ramsey-superpedestrian . We're sorry that you're encountering this issue. \r\nA bit of context for why we made this change:\r\n\r\nThe scientific computing community has been following the lead that the numpy team has set with this notification: \r\nhttps://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html\r\n\r\nAs of 12/26/2021, Numpy's official support of Python 3.7 was dropped. In their follow-up release, this support was dropped. Soon after, many packages that depend on numpy (the majority of the ML-focused integrations within MLflow) also dropped support for Python 3.7. Due to the fact that many packages dependencies do not specify version-pinning of their packages, including support for a 'dropped' language support in MLflow would leave a problematic experience for users of MLflow with frustrating dependency issues to resolve. \r\n\r\nBecause of this, we've followed suit with the NEP-29 policy and removed Python 3.7 support with the 2.0.1 release of MLflow last week. \r\n\r\nI know this is frustrating that this limits you from using newer versions of MLflow within Google collab. Based on this issue 2165 on the collabtools repository, I don't think that you're alone in experiencing issues with deprecation and the otherwise complex steps required to update collab to support a more modern version of Python from within the Jupyter kernel (although it is entirely possible to do so with conda or virtualenv). \r\n\r\nI wish I had better news for you here, but due to the overwhelming number of tooling packages that have dropped support for Python 3.7 (the count of which is continuing to rise), I think your best course of action will be to either file an issue with the collab project to follow suit with NEP-29 or provide a simpler means of upgrading the kernel python version. \r\nWe won't be reverting this change as it is not a bug, but rather is an intended act of stability for our users. \r\n\r\nRegarding the 2nd portion of your issue \"In which case I will submit a bug regarding an incompatibility between mlflow client 1.30.0 and and mlflow server 2.0.1, but it's not clear whether this should be addressed by providing a patch to the client or a patch to the server.\" This won't be addressed either. 2.0.1 is a breaking change release (hence the major version declaration) and as such there is no plans to enable full compatibility with all features wherein the client is an older version than the server. If we were to address this compatibility, we would have to perform patch releases to all 1.x released versions that have been released within the last year which would be an incredibly time-consuming endeavor for effectively zero net benefit. \r\n\r\nHere's a good example of the bash commands to use miniforge to get your notebook environment to use an updated version of Python:
