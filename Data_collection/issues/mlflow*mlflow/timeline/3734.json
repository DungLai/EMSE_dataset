I want to put as much mlflow related code into the specific model classes, so I don't have to deal with it from the outside. It seems to me this is an approach that mlflow doesn't really motivate. All examples I've looked at do all their mlflow.log... calls from the outside.\r\n> \r\n> Why is that?\r\n\r\nThis is more to do with the evolution of APIs for tracking. I reckon as we are moving toward universal `mflow.autolog()` this may be a matter of choice, as all MLflow entities are automatically logged for you. For any additional entities, you can resort to using log_* APIs.\r\n\r\nIt's not unreasonable to extend the model flavor and wrap your specific log entities as public methods, in addition to auto logging capabilities. And this works well if you writing your own [Custom Python Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#custom-python-models) or [custom model flavors.](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#custom-flavors)\r\n\r\nWould you also argue that model flavors should be callable? (this is the Python pattern used in PyTorch)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/733886844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/733905543","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3734#issuecomment-733905543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3734","id":733905543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMzkwNTU0Mw==","user":{"login":"pietz","id":13137132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTM3MTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13137132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz","html_url":"https://github.com/pietz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-25T19:24:48Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T19:24:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank you @dmatrix That's definitely a better place.
