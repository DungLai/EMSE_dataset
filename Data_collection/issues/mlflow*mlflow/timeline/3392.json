Namely, we've agreed on the following goals:\r\n\r\n1. Provide an easy-to-use API (e.g. `mlflow.shap.log_explanation(model_or_predict_func, features, explanation_path=None)`) for generating and persisting model explanation plots & shap values as part of a model-training run, so that users can understand how their input features influence model predictions & behavior. Users should be able to directly pass models trained in common ML frameworks like sklearn/xgboost/keras etc, with an escape hatch of being able to pass a model-agnostic `predict_func` as the first argument to `log_explanation` if using another ML framework.\r\n\r\n2. If possible, persist the metadata needed to explain model output on new inputs in the future. For example, after deploying a model logged with MLflow for real-time inference using e.g. MLflow's `mlflow models serve` deployment CLI, it'd be great if users could also see explanations of their model's predictions.\r\n\r\nFor 1), based on @slundberg 's helpful pointer in https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/295, the `shap.Explainer` API seems perfect for making use case 1) simple. One challenge we've run into is understanding which plots can & should be generated by default for an arbitrary user-supplied model, using the `shap.Explanation` objects returned by `shap.Explainer`; the easiest seems to be generating summary bar plots (`shap.bar_plot`). It seems with additional input from the user (e.g. which label to visualize for multiclass classification), we could additionally generate `shap.summary_plot`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor 2), our current understanding is that although it's possible to generate explanations solely using a model and new serving input, e.g:\r\n```\r\nimport shap\r\nexplainer = shap.Explainer(deployed_model, single_serving_input_example)\r\nshap_values = explainer(single_serving_input_example)\r\n# generate plots etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe discussion in https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/370 and https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/375 suggests the quality of these explanations may not be great (i.e. supplying more examples when constructing an `Explainer` results in higher quality explanations). One solution could be logging the input `features` to `log_explanation` along with the generated explanation plots & shap values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/699691482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3812027460,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgxMjAyNzQ2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3812027460","actor":{"login":"slundberg","id":3740613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3740613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg","html_url":"https://github.com/slundberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-27T21:38:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3812027462,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MTIwMjc0NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3812027462","actor":{"login":"slundberg","id":3740613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3740613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg","html_url":"https://github.com/slundberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slundberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-27T21:38:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3812027463,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgxMjAyNzQ2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3812027463","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-27T21:38:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3812027464,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MTIwMjc0NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3812027464","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://a

and others, we'd love your feedback/thoughts on:\r\n\r\n1) What's the long-term goal for `shap.Explainer` and `shap.Explanation`? The former seems aimed at abstracting away reasoning about the model type (is it a tree model, deep learning model, etc) from the user. Is the goal of `shap.Explanation` to provide a similar model-agnostic interface that can be consumed by SHAP's plotting APIs and other tools?\r\n2) Is our understanding correct that several (is there a good way to reason about how many?) background examples are needed in order to generate accurate explanations on new inputs at model-serving time?\r\n\r\nAnd @eedeleon sorry I missed your earlier comment - I think @harupy independently stumbled upon InterpretML, found that it had an API very similar to SHAP, and that it generated very useful visualizations :)\r\n\r\nIf you & @slundberg are up for it, it'd be great to chat some time to see how we can collaborate - thanks again to both of you for your thoughts/input on
