comment](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7104#issuecomment-1288522699), before I wasn't setting MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=`https://<region-name>.digitaloceanspaces.com` (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5439) also on the client side (only S3 credentials) and I was getting an error like:\r\n\r\n`Could not connect to the endpoint URL: \"https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/5/190cbf0a10734f308d070059f0dd8698/artifacts/model/model.pkl\"`\r\n\r\nfrom a `mlflow.sklearn.log_model` on a simple jupyter lab on the mlflow _sklearn_logistic_regression_ example,\r\nso there was clearly a malformed url instead of the correct one `https://<bucket-name>.<region-name>.digitaloceanspaces.com`.\r\n\r\nIMHO this issue clashes with the [official documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#amazon-s3-and-s3-compatible-storage) when a a **warning box** says:\r\n\r\n> ... For example, providing --default-artifact-root $MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL on the server side **and** MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL on the client side will create a **client path resolution issue for the artifact storage location** ... \r\n\r\ncontinuing with\r\n\r\n> ... To prevent path parsing issues, **ensure** that reserved environment variables are **removed (unset)** from client environments. \r\n\r\nActually **the opposite is true**, so now if this is the intended way to make S3 compatbile storage working for remote artifact storage maybe the official documentation has to be (temporarily? if this is a bug) updated.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1290136642/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zingbert","id":22890401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODkwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22890401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert","html_url":"https://github.com/zingbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zingbert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1290191611","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7104#issuecomment-1290191611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7104","id":1290191611,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85M5sL7","user":{"login":"tamis-laan","id":3178666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzg2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3178666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan","html_url":"https://github.com/tamis-laan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamis-laan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-25T08:36:03Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T11:01:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oke let me give some clarity on my setup and what is happening. I'm trying to setup a tracking server and log experiments and artifacts over there. This way I can also use mlflow as my model store.\r\n\r\nI configure the mlflow server using environment variables as followed:\r\n```\r\nMLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI=xxx://xxx:xxx@xxx:xxx/mlflow\r\n\r\nAWS_DEFAULT_REGION=xxxx\r\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx\r\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx\r\nMLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.cloud\r\n\r\nMLFLOW_DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_ROOT=s3://mlflow/\r\nMLFLOW_ARTIFACTS_DESTINATION=s3://mlflow/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI start the ml server as followed:\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --serve-artifacts -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8000\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext I run @harupy his clinet side code to create and log an artifact:\r\n``` python\r\n# Save this code as a.py\r\n\r\nimport os\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    mlflow.log_artifact(__file__)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using the following client side environment variables:\r\n```\r\nMLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://0.0.0.0:8000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in the following client side error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File
