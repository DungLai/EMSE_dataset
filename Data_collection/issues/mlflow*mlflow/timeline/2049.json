(not `mlflow db upgrade`)). But I have one legacy container with `mlflow==1.3` where the problem does **not** apply - it recognizes the updated database is correct and it retrieves metrics and params archived by MLflow under version 10.3 from the database migrated to version 10.5 (despite never using `mlflow db upgrade`)! Only when I try to rebuild the container, upgrading mlflow to its more recent versions, does it start failing.
