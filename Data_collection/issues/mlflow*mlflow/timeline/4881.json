I was looking into this issue again. What I noticed when looking at the DatabricksSubmitRunOperator of Airflow, that they use the Databricks API 2.1 (https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs.html#operation/JobsRunsSubmit) version where you can submit runs to an existing cluster. This would mean that your proposed change could be implemented. Do you agree? \r\n\r\nEdit.
