@juntai-zheng \r\nThe actual problem occurred inside a REST route (flask) that needed to load things from the tracking database upon user request. \r\nAs I was creating a tracking client object inside the route function, this would lead to the flask app  \r\ncrashing after a certain number of requests, because connections are never freed up. \r\nOne can easily be lead to believe he is only using a single database connection, because there is only a single tracking client object in scope, when in reality there can be open connections that have not been closed when the tracking client object went out of scope and can not be closed anymore because the client that allocated them is no longer even accessible.\r\n\r\n@dbczumar Agreed, it can easily lead to hard-to-find bugs with long-running applications crashing seemingly randomly - hence why I opened this issue to at least have things documented. \r\n\r\nA potential workaround is to wrap a tracking client object in a singleton pattern to ensure a single instance across the entire application. \r\nI believe an update to the documentation highlighting the existence of this problem and guiding on avoiding it (with my workaround above or a different, better one) could be sufficient, if a principled fix seems difficult/out of reach.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/612399914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MFreidank","id":6368040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjgwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6368040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank","html_url":"https://github.com/MFreidank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3223967879,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIyMzk2Nzg3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3223967879","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-11T11:35:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3223967880,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMjM5Njc4ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3223967880","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-11T11:35:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3223967881,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIyMzk2Nzg4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3223967881","actor":{"login":"juntai-zheng","id":39497939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng","html_url":"https://github.com/juntai-zheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-11T11:35:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3223967882,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMjM5Njc4ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3223967882","actor":{"login":"juntai-zheng","id":39497939,"node_id":"MDQ6

Unfortunately, I attempted to reproduce this issue and was unable to achieve the same `Too many connections` error against a MySQL database.
