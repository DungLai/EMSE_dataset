My 2cents on it, I think it is better to have an abstraction where users only provide their list of dependencies (readable yaml, for ex), and not care about what dockerfile uses to build mlflow container.

That way, we can keep mlflow's docker container lightweight, which is important for quickly load balancing mlflow in production setup","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/463335223/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bali0019","id":18537688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18537688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019","html_url":"https://github.com/bali0019","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bali0019/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/531420346","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/893#issuecomment-531420346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/893","id":531420346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTQyMDM0Ng==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T23:24:57Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T23:24:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

My 2cents on it, I think it is better to have an abstraction where users only provide their list of dependencies (readable yaml, for ex), and not care about what dockerfile uses to build mlflow container. It can be conda, nix or even npm. That way, we can keep mlflow's docker container lightweight, which is important for quickly load balancing mlflow in production setup\r\n\r\nGoogling for diff. of Conda vs Nix I just found this issue and also a tool to use nix with a yaml file: https://github.com/luispedro/nixml\r\nHope that helps.
