thank you for your fast feedback @smurching !\r\n\r\n> @Zethson thanks for filing this, just to make sure we understand your use case / goals, is the idea that you'd like to define a project with some base docker environment, and then iterate on / make changes to the Python environment within that image without needing to rebuild/push a new docker image?\r\n\r\nI don't think that we have the same idea.\r\nI'll try to explain it again: \r\n## Issue\r\nPlease very briefly glance over [this example](https://github.com/Zethson/mlflow_custom_ms_example). This is basically the mlflow multistep example, but with a Docker container and a conda environment.\r\nNow, please examine the conda.yaml file. This is 100% the very same file that your multistep example WITHOUT DOCKER has. So no changes here.\r\nBut now we have the Dockerfile, which simply takes the conda.yaml file and builds the Conda environment to allow the multistep example to also be run from Docker! (Given https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2851 get solved).\r\nHence, the mlflow project can be run via conda (as before in your example), but also via  Docker (since it simply builds the conda environment).\r\n**The issue:** when a Docker image **AND** a conda environment is specified in the MLProject file, the error: `2020/05/19 10:17:08 ERROR mlflow.cli: === Project cannot contain both a docker and conda environment. ===` occurs.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nmlflow should 100% allow a conda env **AND** a Docker image to be specified in the MLProject file.\r\nBy default it should always try to run the most easily accessible solution (which would be conda I guess) OR run the --no-conda version, which tries to fetch all dependencies from the system.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, new flags should be introduced:\r\n1. with-conda, which would run the current mlflow project with the specified conda env file\r\n2. with-docker, which would run the current mlflow project with the specified docker container\r\n3. with-singularity, which would take the current Docker container and run it via Singularity (NOTE: This would require mlflow to support Singularity, which it does no yet do, but I wanted to mention it here)\r\n\r\n## Your question\r\n\r\n> And if not would you be able to clarify the end user workflow you're envisioning once this feature is implemented (e.g. from writing the project, to executing the project, to ultimately sharing the project with collaborators to execute)?\r\n\r\nThe end user would not notice this change, except that he would now need to use the flag -with-conda or with-docker to run a specific environment. Heck, if just a single environment is defined in the MLProject file (like the current situation only allows), then no changes would be required for the user and he wouldn't even notice this, since we could just run the specified environment.\r\nSharing the project would be like now, I do not see anything that needs to be changed.\r\nThe user would still run `mlflow run https://github.com/blub `, but now add the flags -with-conda if he wants to run it with the conda environment or add the flag -with-docker if he wants to run it within a Docker environment (if present!).\r\nAbout writing the project: Ideally, the mlflow community would adopt a structure like the Nextflow community, which supports the hierarchical approach of conda envs, which are loaded within an also present Docker container to facilitate both options. Since Nextflow also supports Singularity (which can run Docker containers), only the two files are required to support Conda, Docker and Singularity. for the end user. I am working on a tool to facilitate this hierarchical structure for the mlflow community (with GPU support etc) and have already been in contact with Paul Ogilvie who supports my idea. Hence, I hope that we can solve my issues quickly.\r\n\r\n## Why it matters\r\nSupporting the definition of several different environments such as Conda, Docker (& more) allows the user to run the project in his/her preferred environment. It just gives flexibility. Also, Docker and Singularity to of course strongly improve reproducibility, Conda just doesn't cut it.\r\nThe most important reasons are that many high performance environments only allow specific environments to be run. e.g. I am working in a bioinformatics setting on clusters, which also regularly host patient data. We do not allow our Nextflow pipelines to be run with Conda, nor Docker but only Singularity for security reasons.\r\nNow, other big institutions only support Docker, since their admins do not want to deal with Singularity, hence they run the pipelines with Docker.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: The end user would only have to edit the conda.env file, since it would be loaded from the Docker container, which would in turn (in a hopeful close future) be loadable from Singularity.\r\nAs a result, all 3 environments would be supported.

@smurching @Zethson I think that support conda and Docker environments in MLprojects file would be a great enhancement. I agree that flags of the form `--with-docker` and `--with-conda` or a `--env` flag that can be used to specify the environment would be very useful. We could also deprecate `--no-conda` and replace this with `--no-env`. It would be great to get a concrete design for this feature (proposed APIs, proposed behaviors when one environment is specified + when multiple environments are specified).\r\n\r\nI've added a `help
