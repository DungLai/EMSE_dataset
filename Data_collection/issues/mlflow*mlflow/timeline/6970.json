To clarify, are you requesting a configurable timeout for the scoring server that is launched within `mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf()` with `env_manager=\"conda\"` / `env_manager=\"virtualenv\"`?\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to control the scoring server timeout within Spark UDF, then I think that introducing this as an environment variable configuration is a great idea, and we'd be happy to review a PR which incorporates that change.
