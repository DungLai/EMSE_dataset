Unfortunately, the scope of implementing such a feature is substantial when factoring in security, authentication, and properly handling access rights to delete (vs., say, view a run or experiment). We likely will not be looking at this in the short-term for a priority. We hear your request and we'll mark it for consideration for future work, but I can't promise you anything on when (or if) it will ever get done. Sorry for that.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question fully (my apologies for the drive-by answer before), the `delete_run()` and `delete_experiment()` functions are soft deletions only. Essentially it will mark a run or experiment in its lifecycle stage as \"deleted\" so that it will not show up on normal UI queries or API requests that do not explicitly request data with that lifecycle stage. \r\n\r\nTo _permanently_ _delete_ the data from the `backend_store_uri` (artifacts and metadata), there is a cli command for this that can be run by an administrator: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#mlflow-gc  \r\nWith the execution of `mlflow gc --backend-store-uri <PATH> --run-ids <run_ids>` from the cli, 'cleanup' of runs that you are really sure that you don't want hanging around can be done without having to manually go through the s3 bucket.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.
