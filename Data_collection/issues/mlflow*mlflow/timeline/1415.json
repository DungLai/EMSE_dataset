I know Sagemaker can do but I want it from MLFlow, Pytorch serving or TFserving if possible. \r\n\r\nI would like to have the following features:\r\n\r\n1. Ability to seperate AI model deployment and API deployment, such that both AI modelling and API deployment can be decoupled. Say Data Science team do their own research, Backedn/Devops focus on app.\r\n2. Ability to deploy and update AI model with another model by simply rolling in new TF/Pytorch code (model), artifacts (pretrained checkpoints), and other file/weight artifacts from notebooks. Train once and able to deploy them as AWS Lambda without downtime. Then the AWS Lambda can already server new model without bugging the developer team.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/658792228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iqDF","id":22714474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzE0NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22714474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF","html_url":"https://github.com/iqDF","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iqDF/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3548767994,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU0ODc2Nzk5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3548767994","actor":{"login":"ahmed-shariff","id":15046660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDQ2NjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15046660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmed-shariff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-15T14:11:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3548768001,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1NDg3NjgwMDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3548768001","actor":{"login":"ahmed-shariff","id":15046660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDQ2NjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15046660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmed-shariff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-15T14:11:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/660447237","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1415#issuecomment-660447237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1415","id":660447237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MDQ0NzIzNw==","user":{"login":"ahmed-shariff","id":15046660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDQ2NjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15046660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmed-shariff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-shariff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-18T08:07:45Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T08:07:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I had moved on from that project, and I haven't done much in terms of deployment recently, so what I had done might be a little outdated. I mean that was pre-pytroch serving and all. It is just as I describe in the OP. My lambda function looked something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport json\r\nimport boto3\r\nimport os\r\nfrom utils import process_scene, ModelSession\r\n\r\nbucket_name = os.environ['BUCKET_NAME']\r\nonnx_file_location = os.environ['ONNX_FILE'] \r\nsynset_file_location = os.environ['SYNSET_FILE'] \r\ns3 = boto3.resource('s3')\r\nonnx_file = s3.Object(bucket_name, onnx_file_location).download_file('/tmp/model.onnx')\r\n\r\nmodel_session = ModelSession(\"/tmp/model.onnx\")\r\n\r\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\r\n    images = json.loads(event['body'])['images']\r\n    output = process_scene(images, model_session)\r\n    return {\r\n        'statusCode': 200,\r\n        'body': json.dumps(output)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way I had set up the pipeline, the models get pushed from the data science end of things to s3. So the next time a lambda function is spun up, it'll use the new model. The models also return a version ID which I was using to track performance of the models. The lambda function was not directly exposed to the client, it was used by a beanstalk server to process images: it processes client requests and the model results; and the performance tracking was all set up in there.
