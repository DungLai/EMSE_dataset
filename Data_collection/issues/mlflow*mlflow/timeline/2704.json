everyone and thanks for your interest!\r\n\r\nI haven't gone too deep in testing / architecting this because I wanted to gauge your interest first.\r\n\r\nMy idea is a pass-through the aws_credentials via `**kwargs`. The following code taken from the [S3ArtifactRepository](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/60c71fae70aeff9841d60f63e023f129c02dec19/mlflow/store/artifact/s3_artifact_repo.py#L29) could support both clients:\r\n```python\r\nclass S3ArtifactRepository(ArtifactRepository):\r\n    def __init__(self, artifact_uri, aws_credentials=None):\r\n        self._aws_credentials = aws_credentials\r\n        super(S3ArtifactRepository).__init__(artifact_uri)\r\n\r\n    def _get_s3_client(self):\r\n        import boto3\r\n        s3_endpoint_url = os.environ.get('MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL')\r\n\r\n        if self._aws_credentials:\r\n            return boto3.client(\r\n                's3',\r\n                aws_access_key_id=self._aws_credentials.AWS_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY, \r\n                aws_secret_access_key=self._aws_credentials.AWS_SERVER_SECRET_KEY, \r\n                endpoint_url=s3_endpoint_url,\r\n            )\r\n\r\n        # If aws_credentials is unset, use default client\r\n        return boto3.client('s3', endpoint_url=s3_endpoint_url)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see that a different `S3ArtifactRepository` is instantiated upon each log_artifact call [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/68730c77773a9bc86633e49237e46e095dd21bd9/mlflow/store/artifact/artifact_repository_registry.py#L71), so if we forward the aws credentials to [get_artifact_repository](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/68730c77773a9bc86633e49237e46e095dd21bd9/mlflow/store/artifact/artifact_repository_registry.py#L52) we can get a different S3 Client for each call.\r\nI think the credentials can be set in the [log_artifact](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/3eaaa046ce3501a48f390b4d778e34e4168aadac/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py#L250) call by the users.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we can achieve backward compatibility by simply putting default values everywhere, like:\r\n```python\r\n    def get_artifact_repository(self, artifact_uri, aws_credentials=None):\r\n```\r\nIf it's None, revert to the current behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/622644257/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lucagiovagnoli","id":4341034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDEwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4341034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli","html_url":"https://github.com/lucagiovagnoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucagiovagnoli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/628286549","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2704#issuecomment-628286549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2704","id":628286549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODI4NjU0OQ==","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-13T22:51:31Z","updated_at":"2020-05-13T22:51:31Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi @lucagiovagnoli!
