We're actively thinking about how to make it easier to embed pre/postprocessing logic into models.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our recommendation is to use the [mlflow.pyfunc.save_model](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/695) method to store custom preprocessing and model inference code. Was this the method you were trying to use?\r\n\r\nRegarding representing high-dimensional Tensors as Pandas DataFrames for inference with `pyfunc` models, have you tried using the Pandas `MultiIndex`
