On the start page of the experiment it says `Artifact Location: sftp://user@host/home/username/mlflow` But when I click on the date of a run I get `Oops, something went wrong...` from mlflow UI. (The tutorials show a nice UI https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorial.html of course.)\r\n\r\nDoes this problem relate to the sftp path?\r\n\r\nI assume that when I use sftp it should be neither

Did you all ever find a solution for this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/476617378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Gabriel808","id":9767021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjcwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9767021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808","html_url":"https://github.com/Gabriel808","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gabriel808/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2229606231,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIyOTYwNjIzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2229606231","actor":{"login":"maoding","id":21102285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTAyMjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21102285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding","html_url":"https://github.com/maoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-26T13:00:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2229606232,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMjk2MDYyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2229606232","actor":{"login":"maoding","id":21102285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTAyMjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21102285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding","html_url":"https://github.com/maoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-26T13:00:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/477395189","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/902#issuecomment-477395189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/902","id":477395189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzM5NTE4OQ==","user":{"login":"maoding","id":21102285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTAyMjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21102285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding","html_url":"https://github.com/maoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T00:19:09Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T00:19:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @Gabriel808,\r\n\r\nI am sorry I think I cannot help you since I haven’t used this in an Azure environment.

It required as many as 3 different servers... and given the one-server-per-container rule, I have 3 containers as well:\r\n1) metrics and params are stored in an SQL database, and I used MariaDB (`bitnami/mariadb`) - do not skip this one, as for performance reasons this should be the default option (I ended up increasing worker timeouts to 5 minutes and it was still not enough for default completely non-scalable metrics/params storage in text files)!\r\n2) artifacts, including models, are uploaded to an S3 bucket, I used minIO (`bitnami/minio`) - it could be also probably achieved with NFS, but I would have to wait for / beg the cluster admin to set up appropriate PV's for me, so no, there are safer options these days and as a bonus of setting up minIO  you will gain a nice file transfer tool with a web interface a la Dropbox and even a method of exchanging large files directly between containers (e.g. with the `minio` python package),\r\n3) `mflow server` runs in a dedicated container with access to credentials to both db and S3; and all these access details can be setup with either env vars recognized by mlflow or passed to mlflow server using its startup options in CMD section of your Dockerfile) (`mirekphd/ml-mlflow` - that's a custom one - enjoy:)\r\n\r\nWhat I will have to probably do for security reasons is to add a 4th container with reverse proxy such as `bitnami/nginx` because authorization is another feature missing here... Oh, and I'm not affiliated with Bitnami, it's just that they have constistently hmm, rooted out root from their containers (and so should the official Docker images), so can be run with high UIDs and all capabilities dropped (such are my security constraints for all containers, including dev ones).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/546592561/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mirekphd","id":36706320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzA2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36706320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd","html_url":"https://github.com/mirekphd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/554629562","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/902#issuecomment-554629562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/902","id":554629562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDYyOTU2Mg==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-16T11:43:25Z","updated_at":"2019-11-16T11:43:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
