folks! Thanks so much for surfacing the issue, and apologies about the delay in responding. @daanknoope , thanks for the descriptive analysis of the bug - I agree with your analysis of the issue. \r\n\r\nre: dropping the preview route, the Model Registry is now GA and thus, we feel it's appropriate for future updates to the client to not use preview routes. In general, backwards compatibility where future clients support older server versions is not supported, and I'd recommend you update your server if possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems totally reasonable to add a fix here where we catch `404 Not Found` in addition to `ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND`. @daanknoope would you be able to help with a fix here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1004381183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5837302466,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85AcrNFzwAAAAFb7irC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5837302466","actor":{"login":"daanknoope","id":8389610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODk2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8389610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope","html_url":"https://github.com/daanknoope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T21:47:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5837302472,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85AcrNFzwAAAAFb7irI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5837302472","actor":{"login":"daanknoope","id":8389610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODk2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8389610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope","html_url":"https://github.com/daanknoope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daanknoope/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T21:47:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5837303406,"node_id":"AE_lADOCB5Jx85AcrNFzwAAAAFb7i5u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5837303406","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T21:47:35Z","assignee":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github

behavior. cc: @harupy \r\n\r\n@krstp thanks for adding some more color there around the HTTP response code. Actually, more precisely, the only requirement is that the server must have a version greater than the client. Imo, it's not particularly reasonable for new clients to have to support all older servers - we add new functionality and APIs to the fluent APIs and clients, but the client would have to case for older servers which don't support this new functionality all the time.

came across a similar issue for the `` endpoint.\r\nMLflow server version: 1.21.0 (docs: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/1.21.0/rest-api.html#get-latest-modelversions)\r\nMLflow client version: 1.24.0 (docs: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/1.24.0/rest-api.html#get-latest-modelversions)\r\n\r\nThe obvious first: the request method changed from `GET` to `POST`. Apparently, the MLflow team tries to accommodate for these exact changes here:\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/e78d6e90b0011b4ad33aa9cda84e8e0c7d202349/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py#L265-L270\r\nwhich does not work because if the first method (`POST`) fails, it will break out of the loop and never try to do the `GET` method later.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, I don't get past the first entry and the exception is reraised:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13452321/161020465-1143bb44-280f-4291-8782-17a870bce5fa.png)\r\n\r\nA current workaround is to down-/upgrade either client or server until the REST API matches. To the MLflow team (not meant to be offensive):\r\n- It looks like you already have API versioning in place, please increment the API when introducing breaking changes. Do not try to accommodate for different API versions in the code, it will get harder and harder to read (and frankly, the code is fairly convoluted at this point). \r\n- IMHO your semantic versioning is off because changing the API is a major (= breaking) change and not a minor change.\r\n- As a quick fix to this issue, do not throw exceptions unless the for loop is exhausted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1084309201/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tahesse","id":13452321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDUyMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13452321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse","html_url":"https://github.com/tahesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tahesse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
