I actually spent some time looking into this. I was able to generate a static version of the react front end (you just need to build the js using the provided recipe). I also tried using [Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/) to try to make the flask part static. It is possible for the basic url patterns without an issue. Things get more complicated with things involving the `/api/2.0/` and `/ajax-api/2.0/` urls, apparently those are all constructed programmatically with some code deeper in the mlflow codebase.\r\n\r\nFrozen-Flask does not see those urls, so it doesn't create a static path for them. You can try to force them and they should be theoretically added to your static version, but I wasn't successful at this.\r\n\r\nI think the main problem is that, for my use case, I don't need any of the `POST`-related operations (e.g., creating an experiment). However, in the `mlflow` code, these are heavily intertwined with the `GET`-related operations (e.g., querying for an experiment id). So, I couldn't go much further because I realized it would have taken me a lot of time to look into the mlflow codebase to figure it out.\r\n\r\nFor what is worth, I made my experiments available. There is a service called tensorboard.dev that sort of delivers what I need (a free way to host visualizations). Here is how it looks for my experiments: https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/l6CPJ7TdSdOjxCbibzQJwA/#scalars\r\n\r\nI honestly prefer the `mlflow` interface. If I had a chance to share my experiments within gh-pages, that would be awesome.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately don't have the medium ($$$) to host an mlflow server somewhere for an undetermined amount of time. So anything that is free is what I can provide to other researchers. In that respect, I think there's a pretty good opportunity for the mlflow community to generate static sites. Much less expensive to host, thanks to services like gh-pages.
