thanks for the quick reply.\r\n\r\nI agree the authentication can be better handled outside (nginx, etc.).\r\n\r\nHere is the use case for user-based filter:\r\nWe want to share a mlflow tracking server for a group of users. the web server (nginx) could handle the auth, and pass the user name in HTTP header to mlflow. Since each run has a username, we could only show the runs which match the username in HTTP header.\r\n\r\nIt will be better to have an option to filter on experiments if experiment can have a username while creating the experiment.\r\n\r\nIn our team, each developer manages their own experiments. Within an experiments, the model training usually runs in a container from a cloud environment. We could not save the 'mlruns' in container's local file system, and we need a central tracking server to collect information for all developers. But when a developer opens the mlflow tracking UI, he/she only interests in his/her own experiments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/457463281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"weitian","id":5275150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzUxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian","html_url":"https://github.com/weitian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2096352936,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA5NjM1MjkzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2096352936","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-25T05:47:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2096352937,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwOTYzNTI5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2096352937","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-25T05:47:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/457480817","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/841#issuecomment-457480817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/841","id":457480817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzQ4MDgxNw==","user":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T07:26:37Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T07:26:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, unfortunately user level authN/authZ is currently is harder to achieve.
