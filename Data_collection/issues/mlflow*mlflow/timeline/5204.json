not an author, but I've been working on a new API wrapper I'm calling [lightMLFlow](https://github.com/collegevine/lightMLFlow) that might help with your problem. One of the main ideas behind the package was that the R package that's making calls to the MLFlow API really has no reason to require `boto3` to save things to S3, so I replaced `boto3` with `aws.s3`. It'd be easy to extend that to also allow artifact URIs in Azure, which I assume could rely on a package like [AzureStore](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AzureStor/vignettes/intro.html) for example.
