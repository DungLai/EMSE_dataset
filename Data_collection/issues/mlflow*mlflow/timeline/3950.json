Thanks for filling this FR. Removing boilerplate code by providing built-in decorators or utility methods is not a bad idea. At the same time, we have to be also careful that we don't introduce or nudge a specific pattern of writing a training code function to employ a decorator. \r\n\r\nIMHO, while it certainly works well with your use-case of writing a decorated training_func, it may not apply as a general use case to all. However, I still think this might be a worthwhile effort to provide as a PyPI package or extension that people can `pip install mflow[package]` that would enable them to use this decorator pattern for their training loops for their simple cases. And perhaps write a blog that shows how to use this extension to write training code in scenarios you have found them useful for.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is only my humble opinion. I will have the MLflow committers opine on this, as this affects how to use (or extend) MLflow APIs if it's integrated. But having an installable extension offers developers an option if this suggested pattern holds in all their use cases.\r\n\r\ncc: @harupy @smurching @dbczumar Any opinion on

As a last resort, I think a PyPI package would work, but may be overkill for essentially a single function. Additionally, I would be happy to write a blog post or tutorial for mlflow.org. \r\n\r\nWith regards to use cases, I think it is pretty general, in my experience it is quite common to see training loops in functions (outside of notebooks) even if this is just a main function. As for the decorator nudging people towards the use of training functions, I have often seen, and advocate, the use of main functions in scripts - as opposed to writing the code directly in `if __name__ == '__main__'` as this makes code easier to test, so it could arguably proposed that such encouragement is a good thing. However, if someone strongly disagrees with this, the existing functionality is still there.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate a very general use case, here is an adaptation of the tutorial found at https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorials-and-examples/tutorial.html.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# The data set used in this example is from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality\r\n# P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis.\r\n# Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.\r\nimport argparse\r\nimport logging\r\nimport warnings\r\n\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport mlflow.sklearn\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\r\n\r\nfrom mlflow_decorator import mlflow_experiment\r\n\r\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN)\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef eval_metrics(actual, pred):\r\n    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual, pred))\r\n    mae = mean_absolute_error(actual, pred)\r\n    r2 = r2_score(actual, pred)\r\n    return rmse, mae, r2\r\n\r\n\r\n@mlflow_experiment(autolog=True)\r\ndef main(alpha, l1_ratio):\r\n    warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\r\n    np.random.seed(40)\r\n\r\n    # Read the wine-quality csv file from the URL\r\n    csv_url = \"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv\"\r\n\r\n    # manual logging still works the same way with autolog enabled\r\n    mlflow.log_param(\"csv_url\", csv_url)\r\n\r\n    try:\r\n        data = pd.read_csv(csv_url, sep=\";\")\r\n    except Exception as e:\r\n        logger.exception(\r\n            \"Unable to download training & test CSV, check your internet connection. Error: %s\",\r\n            e,\r\n        )\r\n        raise e\r\n\r\n    # Split the data into training and test sets. (0.75, 0.25) split.\r\n    train, test = train_test_split(data)\r\n\r\n    # The predicted column is \"quality\" which is a scalar from [3, 9]\r\n    train_x = train.drop([\"quality\"], axis=1)\r\n    test_x = test.drop([\"quality\"], axis=1)\r\n    train_y = train[[\"quality\"]]\r\n    test_y = test[[\"quality\"]]\r\n\r\n    lr = ElasticNet(alpha=alpha, l1_ratio=l1_ratio, random_state=42)\r\n    lr.fit(train_x, train_y)\r\n\r\n    predicted_qualities = lr.predict(test_x)\r\n\r\n    (rmse, mae, r2) = eval_metrics(test_y, predicted_qualities)\r\n\r\n    print(\"Elasticnet model (alpha=%f, l1_ratio=%f):\" % (alpha, l1_ratio))\r\n    print(\"  RMSE: %s\" % rmse)\r\n    print(\"  MAE: %s\" % mae)\r\n    print(\"  R2: %s\" % r2)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\r\n    parser.add_argument(\"--alpha\", default=\"0.5\", required=False)\r\n    parser.add_argument(\"--l1_ratio\", default=\"0.5\", required=False)\r\n\r\n    args = parser.parse_args()\r\n    main(args.alpha, args.l1_ratio)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see, combined with the use of autologging (which is amazing by the way!) there is hardly any mlflow specific code, which I find remarkable considering what is logged to the dashboard! In fact, in this example, refactoring the training loop to a function which has injected arguments also enables us to remove the confusing lines:\r\n```\r\nalpha = float(sys.argv[1]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 0.5\r\nl1_ratio = float(sys.argv[2]) if len(sys.argv) > 2 else 0.5\r\n```\r\nas well as making it easier to test using a tool like pytest. In this case, if we wished to leave the manual logging as in the tutorial, the decorator would simply be `@mlflow_experiment`. \r\n\r\nHopefully this has helped to illustrate the generality of this approach and the benefits of integrating it into the core package. I look forward to hearing the opinions from other team members and am happy to help where I can.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/756429457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Chris-hughes10","id":31883449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODgzNDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31883449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris-hughes10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4181994015,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE4MTk5NDAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4181994015","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-07T22:35:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4181994021,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxODE5OTQwMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4181994021","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-07T22:35:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/756504188","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3950#issuecomment-756504188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3950","id":756504188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjUwNDE4OA==","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-08T02:20:28Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T02:20:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@dmatrix @Chris-hughes10 I'm a fan of the core premise here, which seems to be providing a decorator equivalent for `mlflow.start_run()`. I don't see a fundamental reason why an `@mlflow_run` decorator (which I think describes the use case a bit more accurately than `@mlflow_experiment`) couldn't be introduced to MLflow; in fact, it would be even better if `mlflow.start_run()` could be made usable as a decorator directly without introducing a new method (seems tricky). If a new method is indeed necessary, I think the `mlflow.tracking` module would be an appropriate place to house it (e.g., `mlflow.tracking.mlflow_run`).\r\n\r\nI have a couple of comments on the parameters:\r\n\r\n- It would be nice to match the function signature of `start_run` for consistency (i.e. `experiment_name` should be revised to `experiment_id`)\r\n- `set_tracking_uri` operates at a global level, resulting in side-effects beyond the scope of execution of the decorated function. Accordingly, I don't think this is quite the right place for a `tracking_uri` parameter, especially since most use cases will leverage the existing tracking URI without needing to override it\r\n- Similarly, `mlflow.autolog` operates at a global level, enabling autologging for all subsequent runs beyond those created within scope of the decorated function. While I think it's a really interesting idea to consider run-specific autologging enablement in the context of `start_run`, I don't think we should add an `autolog` parameter to such a decorator unless / until we decide to incorporate it into `start_run` as well.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this feedback makes sense.

@dbczumar, thanks for your feedback, I'm glad that you like the approach and I'm happy to take your feedback onboard and submit a PR. Looking over the codebase, I think the best option would be introducing an additional `@mlflow_run` function as opposed to modifying `start_run`.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind the current choice of parameters was to enable mlflow to be enabled in an existing script with minimal effort, just by adding a single line; even without really knowing the details of the mlflow API. As the experiment name and tracking uri can be set using environment variables I am happy to remove them as decorator parameters, although this would then require the user to take an additional step to set these. Perhaps just having more visibility on this for new users would suffice in the form of a tutorial or similar alongside the use of the decorator, which I would be happy to contribute as part of this work.\r\n\r\nHowever, with regards to the autologging, I have a couple of suggestions. If it was to be included in the decorator, it could be reverted to its initial state after the function execution has finished, which would remove the side effects and still maintain the benefits of converting an existing script to use mlflow in a single line. Alternatively, although this would be a different feature, what would your thoughts be on using an environment variable to enable autologging with the default settings globally?\r\n\r\nOnce I have clarity on this additional point, I should be able to turn a PR around for this quite quickly as the code is essentially already written.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/756688637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Chris-hughes10","id":31883449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODgzNDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31883449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris-hughes10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris-hughes10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4183871833,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE4Mzg3MTgzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4183871833","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-08T10:48:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4183871843,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxODM4NzE4NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4183871843","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-08T10:48:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
