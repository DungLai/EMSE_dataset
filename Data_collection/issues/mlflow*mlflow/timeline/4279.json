Thanks for filing this. An interesting feature requrest. It makes a sensible ask for local run since we use directory structure for run_ids in the File System. In this case, an ability to have a human-readable directory structure could be desriable for \r\nparsing or perusing or identifying by a certain custom string. \r\n\r\nThing is that most people in production will use MLflow with a SQLAlchemy compatibel store, where foldernames become a moot point. For artifacts, those are stored as ref on pointers to actual location on the cloud storage.\r\n\r\nIf designed and implemented, it'll take a fair amount of code changes.

@dmatrix , thanks for the quick response. If it requires a large amount of changes it's probably not worth it, I was hoping the folder structure isn't really tied to other backends.

sorry, missed your previous comment. I'm already using the runName for that kind of stuff. My problem is really just due to me having to move around folders manually quite often, so I still have to have the UI open, see which ID corresponds to which name, and go from there. Not very efficient when you're working with more than a few runs. But it's fine, I'll probably script some of that once it's annoying enough ;)\r\n\r\nClosing the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/830217460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jenspetersen","id":12710698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzEwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12710698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen","html_url":"https://github.com/jenspetersen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4670555709,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDY3MDU1NTcwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4670555709","actor":{"login":"jenspetersen","id":12710698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzEwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12710698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen","html_url":"https://github.com/jenspetersen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenspetersen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-30T16:38:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
