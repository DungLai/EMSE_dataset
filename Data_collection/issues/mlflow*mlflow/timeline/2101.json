  Thank you for the response.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, there is nothing in the current Travis test that validates the `docker build`.   The Travis tests basically test only Python/R related code.  This is a reason that issues like #1250 and #1394 occur.\r\n\r\nWhen you write, \"Do you think you could write a test for this so we don't run into this issue in the future?\"   I'm assuming you mean to test **building the docker image**.  If this is the case, I don't think the `pytest` approach will meet that need.  \r\n\r\nIn researching this, I found [this write-up](https://bencane.com/2016/01/11/using-travis-ci-to-test-docker-builds/) on testing  building a docker image using Travis.  If this is what you had in mind, I can take  stab at doing the test but it will require modifying `.travis.yml`.  Since this is a key foundation to mlflow's CI/CD pipeline, I want to confirm that it is you are looking for me to do.

I think editing the `travis.yml` file would be the right move. You should probably add the test to the nightly stage as a new Docker section, as the test would probably be pretty heavy and not needed for every PR. You will have to change [line 18](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/.travis.yml#L18) to check that the Dockerfile changed similar to the check for seeing if anything related to your `examples` tests has changed. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you wanted to use `pytest` to test this, you could probably use a wrapper for cli commands and make it work.\r\n\r\nTravis can be pretty
