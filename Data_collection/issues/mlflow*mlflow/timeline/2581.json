says:\r\n\r\n> PyTorch's model serialization API, torch.save, accepts a pickle_module parameter that users can leverage to specify how the specified PyTorch model class is serialized. Unfortunately, cloudpickle is not directly compatible with this method because of the way it imports pickle.Pickler into its namespace.\r\n\r\n> This PR provides a module that correctly imports from CloudPickle and defines cloudpickle.Pickler as cloudpickle.CloudPickler for compatibility with the PyTorch serialization routine. It will allow users to call mlflow.pytorch.save_model(..., serialization_module=mlflow.pytorch.pickle) to persist model definitions with CloudPickle, allowing class definitions to be captured from notebooks and the __main__ scope.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/599331602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3198228631,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE5ODIyODYzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3198228631","actor":{"login":"arjundc-db","id":61438563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDM4NTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61438563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db","html_url":"https://github.com/arjundc-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-03T22:39:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
