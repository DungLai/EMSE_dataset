ran into the same issue with mlflow 1.8.0. I assumed `mlflow ui` would pick up my `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` from the environment, but it does not. Which means that my `mlflow ui` was looking for local metadata while my `train.py` was writing information to a local `sqlite` database because of having used `export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=sqlite:///mlflow_tracking.sqlite` before running my `train.py`.\r\n\r\nSolution was to pass the alternative tracking uri as a commandline parameter to mlflow ui:\r\n`mlflow ui --backend-store-uri $MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/645429194/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bneijt","id":61703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt","html_url":"https://github.com/bneijt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bneijt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/866695753","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/468#issuecomment-866695753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/468","id":866695753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NjY5NTc1Mw==","user":{"login":"sidazhou","id":8648738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDg3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8648738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sidazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T09:50:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T09:51:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(f'file://{ROOT_DIR}/mlflow_data')` and I manually deleted the trashed experiment:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd $ROOT_DIR/mlflow_data\r\nrm -rf .trash/2/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then refreshed the UI, and create new experiment (which gave this MissingConfigException) and something something, and suddenly there was `$ROOT_DIR/mlflow_data/mlruns` directory\r\n\r\nThe fix was\r\n```\r\ncd $ROOT_DIR/mlflow_data\r\nrm -rf mlruns/\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/866695753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sidazhou","id":8648738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDg3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8648738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sidazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidazhou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
