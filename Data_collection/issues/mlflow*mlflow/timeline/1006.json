I don't use Docker per se, just Conda. Here is the warning I get:\r\n\r\n`~/miniconda3/envs/mlflow-9c11590e267466ef952e604ddcc6ef166c0a38b9/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/utils/environment.py:26: YAMLLoadWarning: calling yaml.load() without Loader=... is deprecated, as the default Loader is unsafe. Please read https://msg.pyyaml.org/load for full details.`\r\n`env = yaml.load(_conda_header)`\r\n\r\nI went through [PyYAMLDocumentation](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation) and saw that the recommended way of doing it is using `.safe_load` instead of `.load`. Here is the reason why:\r\n\r\n> Warning: It is not safe to call yaml.load with any data received from an untrusted source! yaml.load is as powerful as pickle.load and so may call any Python function. Check the yaml.safe_load function though.\r\n\r\nSince `conda.yaml`s for Mlprojects are simply nested dictionaries of lists of strings, I think it's okay to switch that function to `safe_load`. Again, this is a decision to be made by the maintainers.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/475689573/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dorukhansergin","id":11355765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzU1NzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11355765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin","html_url":"https://github.com/dorukhansergin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorukhansergin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/531409638","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1006#issuecomment-531409638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1006","id":531409638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTQwOTYzOA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T22:25:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T22:25:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
