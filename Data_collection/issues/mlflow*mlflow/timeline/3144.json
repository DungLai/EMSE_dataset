By default, this will be in the `mlruns` directory. And within it, a directory '0' with the `meta.yaml` that will have a path stored in it. The default experiment is always \"Default,\" if you don't specify a name. \r\n\r\nIf you move your python code elsewhere and run it, a new `mlruns` directory is created where the path for the `artifact_location` is different from the previous run in that directory. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that have a consistent `artifact_location` if you are running experiments on your localhost, we recommend that you decide\r\nahead of time where you want artifact store and the backend store to be. Once decided, launch your tracking server with those arguments. For example: `mlflow server --backend-store-uri file:/tmp/issue_3114 --default-artifact-root /tmp/issue_3114`\r\n\r\nThis will launch the mlflow tracking server on your `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  Use this URI in the code.\r\n\r\nHere is the example code:\r\n```\r\nimport joblib\r\nimport mlflow\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n   with open('test.file', 'wb') as f:\r\n      test = range(20)\r\n      joblib.dump(test, f)\r\n   mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://127.0.0.1:5000\")\r\n   exp_info = MlflowClient().get_experiment_by_name(\"issue_3114\")\r\n   exp_id = exp_info.experiment_id if exp_info else MlflowClient().create_experiment(\"issue_3114\")\r\n   with mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=exp_id) as run:\r\n      run_id = run.run_id = run.info.run_uuid\r\n\r\n      params = {\"n_estimators\": 3, \"random_state\": 0}\r\n      mlflow.log_params(params)\r\n      mlflow.log_artifact('test.file')\r\n\r\n      print(f\"artifact_uri={mlflow.get_artifact_uri()}\")\r\n      print(f\"run_id={run_id}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput from  the code:\r\n\r\n ```\r\nartifact_uri=/tmp/issue_3114/0/616239e0c63140d884f3fedde71916a3/artifacts\r\n run_id=616239e0c63140d884f3fedde71916a3\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis will always have the same `artifact_location` from wherever you run the python code with your mlflow code in it. It no longer will\r\ncreate a `mlruns` directory at the same location as where your code runs or resides. \r\n\r\nDoes this answer your question?  \r\n\r\nRegardless of where you run your MLflow code, `artifact_location` will remain the same for all experiments; with this suggested best practice, there's no `mlruns` directory. \r\n\r\ncc: @arjundc-db

you for your fast answer. Unfortunately, this does not resolve my problem yet. I use the function `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` to set the path to the `mlruns` folder.

If I then run the `mlflow ui` in the new location (in order to once again look into the results of this experiment), the UI shows me all logged parameters and metrics, but not the artifacts.
