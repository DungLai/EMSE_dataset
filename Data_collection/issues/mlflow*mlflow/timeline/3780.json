sure I understand what you mean. Logging a model from a Python session involves a fitted model represented in that Python session. And you can’t represent R models in python in general (with the exception of models like xgboost or keas that can be loaded in both languages). If you have an R function already serialised as RDS, you can move this file into a `model/` directory of an MLflow run and also create an `MLmodel` file that meets the MLflow crate conventions but that’s not very elegant and robust. \r\n\r\nFor prediction (and serving), you should be able to use the CLI and Python API independent of whether the model was created with R or Python, e.g. see https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.models.html#mlflow.models.FlavorBackend.predict for the Python. Check to source code but for initializing, `config` can be an empty dict if I remember correctly and then you can call the `predict` method. It’s quite slow though IIRC because of conversion between languages and startup costs, serving is much quicker for processing a request once started up (going thorough Python, saving as csv, starting up R, reading in - all this can be skipped) I can provide more details if you need.
