I tried for a little bit to install a WSGI server in front of the UI but gave up as it seemed to be more involved than I was willing to spend time on it. I opened the issue in the first place as running the UI in a docker container didn't work as the interface was binding to `127.0.0.1` and not `0.0.0.0`, but I believe this is already resolved through other issues (did the same thing on my own fork). Running in a docker container is required for me as I'm running a NGINX proxy in front of all my public facing docker containers.\r\n\r\nThe UI is currently running fine but I now have some other problems as the UI is running on HTTPS. I'll try to figure that out soon though. Feel free to close this issue if you feel it's irrelevant but it's maybe good to keep it open also for the HTTPS remote server support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/396152481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zegerhoogeboom","id":5371096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzEwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5371096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom","html_url":"https://github.com/zegerhoogeboom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/396488514","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/9#issuecomment-396488514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/9","id":396488514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjQ4ODUxNA==","user":{"login":"zegerhoogeboom","id":5371096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzEwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5371096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom","html_url":"https://github.com/zegerhoogeboom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zegerhoogeboom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-12T07:09:11Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T07:09:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Actually the default is now 0.0.0.0 on the current `master`.
