@dmatrix,\r\n\r\nthanks! I guess the misunderstanding is that we are talking about the files inside the docker container!\r\nTo me it looks like you were looking at the permissions of the mounted files on your very own filesystem.\r\n\r\nSo to reproduce it with the mlflow docker example:\r\n`\r\nmlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5`\r\n\r\nYou will then see how it ran Docker, e.g.:\r\n`docker run --rm -v /home/zeth/PycharmProjects/mlflow/examples/docker/mlruns:/mlflow/tmp/mlruns -v /home/zeth/PycharmProjects/mlflow/examples/docker/mlruns/0/f3ebf070053643ab9171c4834424c9c1/artifacts:/home/zeth/PycharmProjects/mlflow/examples/docker/mlruns/0/f3ebf070053643ab9171c4834424c9c1/artifacts -e MLFLOW_RUN_ID=f3ebf070053643ab9171c4834424c9c1 -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=file:///mlflow/tmp/mlruns -e MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID=0 docker-example:142abbb python train.py --alpha 0.5 --l1-ratio 0.1`\r\n\r\nAfter mlflow is done you can start the Docker container in interactive mode with a shell:\r\n`docker run --rm -it -v /home/zeth/PycharmProjects/mlflow/examples/docker/mlruns:/mlflow/tmp/mlruns -v /home/zeth/PycharmProjects/mlflow/examples/docker/mlruns/0/f3ebf070053643ab9171c4834424c9c1/artifacts:/home/zeth/PycharmProjects/mlflow/examples/docker/mlruns/0/f3ebf070053643ab9171c4834424c9c1/artifacts -e MLFLOW_RUN_ID=f3ebf070053643ab9171c4834424c9c1 -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=file:///mlflow/tmp/mlruns -e MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID=0 docker-example:142abbb /bin/bash` \r\n(I added -it and replaced the run command with /bin/bash).\r\nIf you now navigate through the file system to the artifacts etc everything will be owned by root.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/634789012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Zethson","id":21954664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTU0NjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21954664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson","html_url":"https://github.com/Zethson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3379066948,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM3OTA2Njk0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3379066948","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-27T16:38:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3379066950,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNzkwNjY5NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3379066950","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-27T16:38:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3379067099,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzM3OTA2NzA5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3379067099","actor":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-27T16:38:54Z","label":{"name":"needs
