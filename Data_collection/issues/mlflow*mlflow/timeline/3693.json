While less likely, my guess would be the same issue happens for very large numbers (e.g. `123456789000` -> `123456789 ...` . Is that right?\r\n\r\nIn either case, I think my preference would be that the current truncation be replaced with rounding (using scientific notation where necessary). It doesn't quite cover the original request's \"show all digits,\" but I think it's a good compromise that should cover the majority of use-cases.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for looking into this!

I spoke with some frontend dev friends, and most of them advised a more advanced solution that I propose above, and I think I agree: Have the number of digits displayed (and width of the field) change dynamically to ensure there's enough digits to differentiate all metrics that show for the field, on the page. For example, if the values for a specific metric were 0.11111200, 0.11111210, and 0.11111300, display the values to 7 decimal places. I've never looked at the backend or backend of the frontend, but presumably that's something that should be done at least in javascript and not css.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1383173429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ZaxR","id":19669890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjY5ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19669890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR","html_url":"https://github.com/ZaxR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZaxR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8229724469,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx84sTUGJzwAAAAHqh6E1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/8229724469","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-15T15:01:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8229724474,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx84sTUGJzwAAAAHqh6E6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/8229724474","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-15T15:01:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
