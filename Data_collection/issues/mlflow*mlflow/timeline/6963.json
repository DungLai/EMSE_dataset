@addisonklinke, thank you for filing this feature request. A CoreML flavor for MLflow is very exciting. At this time, we'd recommend introducing the flavor as an integrated Python package that populates the `mlflow.coreml` namespace. This package can be pretty lightweight, e.g. it can consist of a single module defining flavor code, similar to the single-module construction of flavors like `mlflow.catboost`: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/catboost.py. Once the package has been released, we'd be very excited to document it on the MLflow website.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1266155486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7511454215,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85TJyA2zwAAAAG_t7IH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7511454215","actor":{"login":"addisonklinke","id":39926682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTI2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39926682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke","html_url":"https://github.com/addisonklinke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-03T22:48:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7511454224,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85TJyA2zwAAAAG_t7IQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7511454224","actor":{"login":"addisonklinke","id":39926682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTI2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39926682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke","html_url":"https://github.com/addisonklinke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-03T22:48:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7511454885,"node_id":"AE_lADOCB5Jx85TJyA2zwAAAAG_t7Sl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7511454885","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-03T22:48:47Z","assignee":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczuma
