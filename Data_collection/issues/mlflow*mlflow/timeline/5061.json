Thus, it does not really answer my question which is how to pass multiple parameter values to \"mlflow run\" without having to predefine the param grid.\r\nI just looked at this [example ](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/hyperparam/MLproject) but it appears that you just can't pass multiple values. At most, you can pass a max or a min value and then build the grid inside the code.\r\nAm I right on this point ?\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/977770534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Downfor-u","id":63454063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDU0MDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63454063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u","html_url":"https://github.com/Downfor-u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downfor-u/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/979326369","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5061#issuecomment-979326369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5061","id":979326369,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx846X1Wh","user":{"login":"jwyyy","id":38301522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzAxNTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38301522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy","html_url":"https://github.com/jwyyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwyyy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-25T16:02:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T16:15:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Downfor-u Thanks for your confirmation!
