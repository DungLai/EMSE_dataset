that's great to hear, thank you for considering it.\r\n\r\nI have a few more thoughts on how this might be achieved.\r\n\r\nOne other potential idea is to have a schema specific entry script and then write those to handle the different inputs and outputs. A natural boundary would be the current limitation of not allowing the mixing of `TensorSpec` and `ColumnSpec` Schema types in the same Schema definition, that is input or output. Therefore, it may be possible to build up an entry script text string by having functions appended to the entry script string depending on the type of Schema is contained within the definition of `input` or `output` objects. This could allow the deserializing of the `input` JSON and the readying of the output to JSON ready for serializing of the `output` to be separate considerations, and even separate Schema types.\r\n\r\nHow about something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nENTRY_SCRIPT_STR = '''\r\n\"{input_parsing_package_imports}\"\r\n\"{output_parsing_package_imports}\"\r\nfrom azureml.core.model import Model\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import load_model\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc.scoring_server import \"{input_parsing_function}\", \"{output_parsing_function}\"\r\n\r\ndef init():\r\n    global model\r\n    model_path = Model.get_model_path(model_name=\"{model_name}\", version={model_version})\r\n    model = load_model(model_path)\r\n\r\ndef run(json_input):\r\n    input = \"{input_parsing_function_call}\"\r\n    return \"{output_parsing_function_call}\"\r\n'''\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea above is extended from the existing example, using string `format` arguments to provide the relevant text strings of the required package imports and function calls, which could be controlled on the basis of the model flavour and/or Schema
