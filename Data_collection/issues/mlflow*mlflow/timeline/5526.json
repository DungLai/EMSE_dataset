@dogeplusplus would the current functionality included in the context wrapper `mlflow.start_run()` that supports defining the arguments `run_name` and `tags`={\"run_description\": \"This is what this

Any UI-based description fields that are present are simply logged as tags and are rendered in a different manner from within the UI. \r\nSetting descriptions and any additional data are typically done through applying tags to the run. \r\nThis is typically how users define ancillary information to be associated with a run in code rather than having to add information in the GUI. See: [the API docs](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run)  for the full

yes I could use the tags or the run name to do that.
