have made some notes on things the helm chart might need to support \r\n\r\nArtifact storage configuration:\r\n- S3 / Minio\r\n- ABS (Azure)\r\n- GCS\r\n- FTP / SFTP\r\n- NFS (volume mount: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs)\r\n- HDFS\r\n\r\nTracking database:\r\n- sqlite (local, mount Kubernetes volume for persistence)\r\n- sqlalchemy uri (remote, mount uri from secret)\r\n\r\nMlflow server modes:\r\n- tracking only\r\n- proxy artifact \r\n- standard\r\n\r\n#### Notes: \r\n- Credentials for artifact storage needs to be mounted to the pod with secrets. CA Certificates also need to be optionally mounted as volumes from secrets. The helm chart should support using existing secrets as well as having configurable values for creating secrets.\r\n- Use a format like bitnami helm charts for documenting mlflow specific parameters in the values.yaml file\r\n\r\n#### Questions:\r\n\r\n> 1. [Dependency on this FR: [FR] [Roadmap] Publish official Docker image for MLflow Tracking server #6093] Official docker images for the MLflow Tracking Server (hosted here).\r\n\r\n- The container image needs python libraries for each storage type. The current published container doesn't have boto3 needed for AWS S3 / Minio support (I haven't checked dependencies for other storage backends). We will need to add new images or modify the existing one.\r\n\r\n> 2. Charts must permit standalone deployment to Kubernetes as well as being defined as a sub-chart within a more comprehensive helm chart for a deployment.\r\n\r\n- Could someone expand on the comprehensive helm chart. Would this be a chart that sets up minio, postgres (or just local sqlite) and mlflow? Could we move that into another issue and get standalone done first?\r\n- Where will the helm chart(s) go, `/charts`?\r\n\r\n> 3. Support for individual components (Tracking service, Serving) as well as the ability to install all services from a single helm install command.\r\n\r\n- Could someone expand on what the Serving component is? Edit: looks like this is model serving\r\n\r\n> These helm charts (versioned by release) should be published to the official helm repository here.\r\n\r\n- Need to add CI for pushing helm chart to the specified repository.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am able to contribute or coordinate effort on this. I'd be able to get together a helm chart that supports cloud storage, remote db and standard serving mode but would need to leverage the expertise of others to implement HDFS, (S)FTP and NFS support (I dont have experience using these with mlflow).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1336035147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ichbinjakes","id":20906800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTA2ODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20906800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes","html_url":"https://github.com/ichbinjakes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichbinjakes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
