thanks for your suggestion. It works for my case. However, there are still some concerns. For example, \r\n1) In order to show the metrics over time, I have to explicitly select the runs to compare. \r\n2) The compared graph uses runIds as X-axis, which is not flexible enough, since runIds are just some random strings, which fail to show the date-time of a run. \r\n\r\nI searched the issue history, and found the proposal #598 satisfies my needs. But need to wait for its implementation.
