awesome, I'm a fan of this as a workaround given that Plotly doesn't allow making the tooltips \"sticky\". I guess if users have a plot with many runs (many overlapping lines), they can isolate the run (line) of interest by double-clicking it in the legend on the right, then click the selected line. It does seem a little hard to discover though.\r\n\r\n@gioa @mateiz @clemens-db any thoughts here?\r\n\r\nAlso, I was wondering if we could also/instead add a link to the run in the plotly legend, e.g:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2358483/72107654-9a406600-32e6-11ea-9266-4b380972c03f.png)\r\n\r\nHowever this seems difficult to do - it's possible to change the legend text [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/3440c127c9e27d8b5cf6affd0b1ced3890720e8f/mlflow/server/js/src/components/MetricsPlotView.js#L29) to include a hyperlink, e.g. by replacing that line with something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (isComparing) {\r\n      legendText += `, ${Utils.truncateString(runDisplayName, MAX_RUN_NAME_DISPLAY_LENGTH)}`;\r\n      return `${legendText} <a href='http://google.com'>(link)</a>`;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, customizing the toggle behavior of the legend (getting the link text to actually trigger when clicked, instead of toggling the

E.g. you'd have to have one \"jump to the run\" button next to each run but only one close button.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/572810565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"clemens-db","id":49700219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzAwMjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49700219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db","html_url":"https://github.com/clemens-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemens-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/572826980","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2279#issuecomment-572826980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2279","id":572826980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjgyNjk4MA==","user":{"login":"gioa","id":1960721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjA3MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1960721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa","html_url":"https://github.com/gioa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T01:05:06Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T01:05:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @clemens-db for the feedback!
