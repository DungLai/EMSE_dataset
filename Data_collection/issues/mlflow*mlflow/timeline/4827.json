It does seem like a good route to me. MLflow's schema enforcement seems to convert None values to pandas.NA, which doesn't seem totally unreasonable -- it just doesn't work with scikit-learn's SimpleImputer.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there's another \"more correct\" behavior for MLflow. We could keep \"None\", but it's not obvious that that's better in all cases, so fixing this on the scikit side seems like a reasonable long-term solution.\r\n\r\ncc @tomasatdatabricks
