@adriangonz. We have considered doing this in the past but decided to go with the minimal default environments instead. The reason was what you said above - that the environment used for training can include more dependencies than is necessary for inference. And any extra dependencies will increase chances of portability issues (and make scoring image larger). Default environment seemed like a safer choice at the time.\r\n\r\nDo you have a use case where the default environment is not sufficient?\r\n\r\nIt might be valuable to have an option to request the behavior you described above. Or we can add a utility function that gets you definition of the current active environment. Does that sound
