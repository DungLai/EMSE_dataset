The current tradeoff here for `FileStore` is that we are recording a single param (also metric) on a line. We want to ensure that a param is not logged again with a different value, hence the assertion.\r\n\r\nCan you help me understand the use case here for multi-line params. `log_param` API was design to records hyper parameter used for a run, and we did not envision multi-line text. If you want to record additional information about a run, please consider using tags. Since version `0.7.0` you can record multi-line tags using `set_tag` API. It works similar to `log_params` and all you need to change is the method name.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/428297259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/428306944","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/614#issuecomment-428306944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/614","id":428306944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODMwNjk0NA==","user":{"login":"hangelwen","id":1547796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDc3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen","html_url":"https://github.com/hangelwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangelwen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T18:48:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T18:48:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mparkhe Thanks for the details.
