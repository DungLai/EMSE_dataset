So I've created [this draft pr](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2608) to show how it could work? I didn't go into tests or doc or anything like that, just a straightforward implementation that kinda follows what's being done for `--param-list` :)\r\n\r\nIt'd be awesome if you guys could implement it. If the general idea of the PR looks good to you but you don't think you'll be able to get to it, I can try to work on it thought it might take me longer. Let me know!

@tomasatdatabricks Gotcha, so right now the only way we can do `mlflow run` with GPUs is using conda env correct?\r\n> \r\n> In that case it could easily work for docker environments as well if we could set on MLproject file something like:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> docker_env:\r\n>     image: my-image\r\n>     run_params: [['--gpus', 'all'], ['--other-flag', 'value'], ...]\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> And have `run_params` propagated to wherever mlflow calls `docker run` and just append them.\r\n\r\nThis solution looks great to me!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/604491929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Zethson","id":21954664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTU0NjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21954664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson","html_url":"https://github.com/Zethson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3168752658,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE2ODc1MjY1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3168752658","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T15:21:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3168752663,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNjg3NTI2NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3168752663","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T15:21:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
