this the official suggested way to save and load fasttext models? It isn't working currently in Databricks. I'm trying to load the fit fasttext model for use as a preprocessor to convert a sentence into a sentence vector prior to classification model predictions.

it's been a while, but this is how I tackled it back then:\r\n\r\nThus, you train your model as you would with the standard FastText methods\r\n```\r\nft_model_sup = fasttext.train_supervised('your_train_data.text', lr=0.5, epoch=50, wordNgrams=2, dim=30, bucket=100000, loss='ova')\r\nft_model_path = os.path.join(\"ft_model.bin\")\r\nft_model_sup.save_model(ft_model_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards, you have to define you conda environment like this and capture your model_path in an artifacts objects. \r\n```\r\ndef my_conda_env(include_cloudpickle=True):\r\n        import fasttext\r\n        pip_deps = ['fasttext==0.9.2']\r\n        if include_cloudpickle:\r\n            import cloudpickle\r\n            pip_deps.append(\"cloudpickle=={}\".format(cloudpickle.__version__))\r\n    \r\n        return _mlflow_conda_env(\r\n            additional_conda_deps=None,\r\n            additional_pip_deps=pip_deps,\r\n            additional_conda_channels=None\r\n        )\r\n\r\nartifacts = {\r\n            \"ft_model\": ft_model_path\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere you instantiate a custom_model object from mlflow and add this to your custom_model log parameters. You also add the artifact model object which refers to where your model is saved. This will be used to load the model afterwards.\r\n```\r\nmymodel = custommodel.CustomModel()\r\ncustom_model.log_model(python_model=mymodel, \r\n                            artifact_path=\"\", \r\n                            artifacts=artifacts, \r\n                            registered_model_name='my-model', \r\n                            code_path=[\"custommodel.py\"],\r\n                            conda_env=my_conda_env())\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow to use your model. You capture your model from the artifacts and use it.\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow.pyfunc as custom_model\r\nimport fasttext\r\n\r\nclass CustomModel(custom_model.PythonModel):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    def load_context(self, context):\r\n        super(CustomModel, self).load_context(context)\r\n        import fasttext\r\n        self.ft_model = fasttext.load_model(context.artifacts[\"ft_model\"])\r\n\r\n    def predict(self, context, X):\r\n        return X['input'].apply(self.ft_model.predict)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this helps a bit in your journey!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/876966960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GJAE-nv","id":56383189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzgzMTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56383189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv","html_url":"https://github.com/GJAE-nv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJAE-nv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4998708598,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk5ODcwODU5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4998708598","actor":{"login":"jvschoen","id":35496082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDk2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35496082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen","html_url":"https://github.com/jvschoen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvschoen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-09T07:07:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
