I guess it is an expected behaviour but I did not come to the conclusion fast enough.\r\n\r\nActually, I still had a similar issue with mlflow (mlflow, version 1.28.0) trying to use MLproject by:\r\n`mlflow run . --no-conda ...` \r\nor the newer approach\r\n`mlflow run . --env-manager=local ...` \r\n\r\n - When I have an MLproject with only one entry point this command line parameter is enough to ignore the conda env yaml and mlflow does not create automatically any conda env.\r\n \r\n- However, when there are multiple entry points in MLproject, I have to define in the main script workflow for each of the entry points not to use conda env with **env_manager='local'** as a parameter of the method mflow.run(...) , as well.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nMLproject\r\n```\r\nname: test-mlflow\r\n\r\nentry_points:\r\n  train:\r\n    parameters:\r\n      alpha: {type: float, default: 0.1}\r\n    command: \"python train.py {alpha}\"\r\n  test:\r\n    command: \"python test.py\"\r\n  main:\r\n    command: \"python main.py\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nmain.py\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef workflow(...):\r\n    with mlflow.start_run() as active_run:\r\n            mlflow.run(\".\", \"train\", env_manager='local')\r\n            ...\r\n            mlflow.run(\".\", \"test\", env_manager='local')\r\n            ...\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    workflow()  \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now `mlflow run . --env-manager=local ...`  works without creating any conda env automatically.\r\n\r\nThank you a lot again!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1216659421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"teodora-petkova","id":8216410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTY0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8216410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova","html_url":"https://github.com/teodora-petkova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teodora-petkova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
