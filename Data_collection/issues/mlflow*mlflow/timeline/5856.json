E.g. instead of `wasbs://my-container@my-account.blob.core.windows.net` configure `wasbs://my-container@my-account.blob.core.windows.net/foo` as `MLFLOW_SERVER_ARTIFACT_ROOT`.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\n`is_directory` (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/artifact/artifact_repo.py#L78-L80) erroneously returns `True` in our case. `listing` looks like this, for example:\r\n```\r\n[<FileInfo: file_size=70, is_dir=False, path='0/310c7a8a52c148d5a0123e234b9c0da9/artifacts/testmodel/testing/logging/to/different/location/requirements.txt'>]\r\n```\r\nbut it should be an empty array in order for `is_directory` to be `False`.\r\n\r\nIn the Azure specific code in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/artifact/azure_blob_artifact_repo.py#L145-L149, `infos[0].path == rel_path` is `False` in our
