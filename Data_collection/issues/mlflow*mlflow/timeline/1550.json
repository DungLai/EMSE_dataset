folks, the MLflow fluent API, including `mlflow.log_metrics()`, is not designed for asynchronous execution (is not thread safe). We recommend using [MlflowClient().log_batch()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html#mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient.log_batch) to record metrics asynchronously.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1024492066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5972597108,"node_id":"CE_lADOCB5Jx84brXSBzwAAAAFj_pl0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5972597108","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-28T18:22:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1024807107","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1550#issuecomment-1024807107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1550","id":1024807107,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx849FVDD","user":{"login":"you-n-g","id":465606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTYwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/465606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g","html_url":"https://github.com/you-n-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/you-n-g/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-29T02:04:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T02:04:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We
