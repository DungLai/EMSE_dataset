uintino that's very interesting. It seems to me, if I'm understanding you correctly, that a concept of \"teams\" may make sense as a solution to your problem as well.\r\n\r\nThe idea of experiments being different approaches to the same project confuses me a bit, as I consider runs to be different approaches to a given experiment. Without knowing the details of your team it's hard to fully digest, but I'm sure you have good reason for your approach.\r\n\r\nI wonder, if you treated an experiment as a \"project\", but only saw the runs (attempts) of people in your team, or you could filter out different teams, would that also work?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm asking is because I would love something like teams to be implemented in MLFlow, with permissions of views and UI logins for each member. And it's just another conceptual way to potentially organize your work. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/611699377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3219582848,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIxOTU4Mjg0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3219582848","actor":{"login":"rquintino","id":10835742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10835742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino","html_url":"https://github.com/rquintino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-09T19:01:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3219582850,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMTk1ODI4NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3219582850","actor":{"login":"rquintino","id":10835742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10835742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino","html_url":"https://github.com/rquintino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-09T19:01:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/617103752","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1414#issuecomment-617103752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1414","id":617103752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzEwMzc1Mg==","user":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T10:49:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T10:51:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Ben-Epstein I'll describe my use-case, which is for me a crucial argument for comparing runs between experiments (unless I miss sth):\r\n- we have a multi-step ML pipeline\r\n- the pipeline is run every Sunday\r\n- each step of the pipeline is running as a separate task within Airflow DAG\r\n- we want to have all steps tracked in one \"catalog\" - either an experiment or a parent run\r\n- this \"catalog\" should be named with a date, e.g. \"21-04-2020\"\r\n\r\nAnd now - to get such an effect with experiments I can just add:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(os.getenv(\"CURRENT_DATE\"))\r\nmlflow.start_run(run_name=\"step-name\")\r\n...\r\nmlflow.end_run()\r\n```\r\nto each step and that's all. But then I cannot compare the final model from \"21-04-2020\" with the one from e.g. \"28-04-2020\".\r\n\r\nAnd what about a parent run? How to manage a parent run's lifecycle through many independent steps being \"child steps\"? I have to start it each time before the proper child run? Moreover - do I really need to pass to every child run a parent run ID looking like `399760f34e6145d3af66b8f04d3ea7d1`? I know I can manage it via envar, but it's far, far less elegant than just using string name like with experiments.\r\n\r\nAnd despite the above - it's just much more intuitive to have each full pipeline as a single \"experiment\" on the left side, named with a date and showing all steps as runs. Imho nested runs should be a solution for very complex / detailed workflows, not sth you have to use on a daily basis. Experiments are extremely underused currently.\r\n\r\nAnd btw - if I want to delete a \"catalog\" from one day it's much easier to find a proper experiment ID (just integer) than this awful run ID. And by delete I mean \"true delete\" from a hard drive, not just changing metadata of an experiment/run via GUI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/617103752/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3255667463,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1NTY2NzQ2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3255667463","actor":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-21T10:49:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3255667469,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTU2Njc0Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3255667469","actor":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-21T10:49:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/617129573","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1414#issuecomment-617129573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1414","id":617129573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzEyOTU3Mw==","user":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T11:45:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T11:45:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jaklan that's interesting, I think I understand your process and issue now. \r\n\r\nIs each stage of the pipeline something you can \"compare\"? Ie does each stage have metrics? For a stage that's not necessarily a model, how do you know if it's outperforming a different run within that stage?\r\n\r\nAlso, you say you want to have all steps in one \"catalog\" which is fair, but I'm curious why. Would the organization structure of:\r\n`mlflow.set_experiment(step_name)\r\nmlflow.start_run(run_name=<>)`\r\n\r\nNot make sense? The date is already tracked in every run automatically. If you can't compare different stages of the pipeline why have them in the same \"experiment?\" That way you can use the run_name for something else that may be useful. \r\n\r\nRegarding nested runs, I think that could actually be an elegant solution as well. Each run is a stage in the pipeline, and it has a bunch of children runs. Comparison within runs of different dates would just be 1 click and you can hold everything in 1 experiment.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding the searching by run_id, I fully agree it's not a nice way to do things.

function?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/617219296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3256533835,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1NjUzMzgzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3256533835","actor":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-21T14:34:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3256533839,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTY1MzM4Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3256533839","actor":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-21T14:34:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/617381258","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1414#issuecomment-617381258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1414","id":617381258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzM4MTI1OA==","user":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T19:57:01Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T19:57:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jaklan Thanks for all of the answers! Very interesting, and a good example of where it may very well be useful to have cross experiment run comparisons.  \r\n\r\nThe helper function is pretty straightforward, but it's in our custom tracking plugin. We essentially loop through all runs of a requested experiment (or all runs of all experiments if no experiment is passed in) and check the run name of each run. If it matches, return the run id/run ids. Not efficient but for this specific task efficiency isn't really a concern.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/617381258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ben-Epstein","id":22605641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22605641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Epstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Epstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3257673192,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1NzY3MzE5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3257673192","actor":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-21T19:57:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3257673202,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTc2NzMyMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3257673202","actor":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-21T19:57:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3557919857,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NTc5MTk4NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3557919857","actor":{"login":"Zangr","id":6811562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTE1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6811562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr","html_url":"https://github.com/Zangr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zangr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-17T12:31:01Z","label":{"name":"area/tracking","color":"48eabc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3557919859,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NTc5MTk4NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3557919859","actor":{"login":"Zangr","id":6811562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTE1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/681156
