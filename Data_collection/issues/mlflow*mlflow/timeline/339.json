According to this [Proto Buf documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json), `int64` are JSON serialized to `string`. `int32` and `float` fields are mapped to `number`, as can be seen in the following example. This is the tutorial example run using: `mlflow run example/tutorial -P alpha=0.4`. As you can see the `int64` fields as you reported were encoded as strings, but metric values which are floats are numbers. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ > curl
