Currently, MLflow supports SDKs in Python, Java, and R, since these were the top 3 languages used for ML. I am curious to learn more about your C++ ML use case and particularly the need for C++ API. How will you be using this and do you have other Python/Java/R code that wraps the C++ ML code where you could use mlflow?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nmani","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/432909050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1925163064,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkyNTE2MzA2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1925163064","actor":{"login":"sepidehhosseinzadeh","id":15150444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUwNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15150444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/sepidehhosseinzadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-25T04:16:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1925163065,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5MjUxNjMwNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1925163065","actor":{"login":"sepidehhosseinzadeh","id":15150444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUwNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15150444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/sepidehhosseinzadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-25T04:16:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/433068401","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/666#issuecomment-433068401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/666","id":433068401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzA2ODQwMQ==","user":{"login":"sepidehhosseinzadeh","id":15150444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUwNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15150444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/sepidehhosseinzadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepidehhosseinzadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sepid

@sepidehhosseinzadeh:\r\n\r\nOne of the things I am not clear on is why you could not use python SDK. What is the interface between your python and C++ code? Are you using C++ for the entire model training flow as well? \r\n\r\nWe talked about this internally in the team and a couple of alternatives were suggested by the team\r\n\r\n- Using Caffe callbacks and inside the callbacks use python SDK. Here's [an example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41490526/what-are-solvers-callback-functions-in-pycaffe-and-how-can-i-use-them).\r\n\r\n- Using [python embedding](https://docs.python.org/2/extending/embedding.html) in your C++ code. You can create the interpreter in `main()` and reuse in your training.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot use the above 2, can you please describe the use case and also why you need C++ SDK to make your flow work. We try to keep the footprint limited based on use cases, so for instance we have python, R, and Java SDKs that interface with the rest client. The plan is to extend SDKs and various types of implementations very carefully. The reason here is so that these can be well unit tested and can continued to be maintained over
