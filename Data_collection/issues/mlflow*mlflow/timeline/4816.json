@tmnhat2001, apologies for the delayed reply. Your proposal for splitting the existing `mlflow.sagemaker.deploy()` functionality into `create_deployment()` and `update_deployment()` sounds great!\r\n\r\nRegarding the limited interface for `delete_deployment()`, `list_deployments()`, and `get_deployment()`:\r\n\r\n1. For `delete_deployment()`, since this operation modifies deployment state, I think it's acceptable to introduce a `config` parameter as a keyword-argument. For backwards compatibility, we can check if `config` is specified and, if it isn't, avoid passing it to the underlying plugin implementation. We can also use `inspect.signature()` to check if the plugin implementation accepts this parameter.\r\n\r\n2. For `list_deployments()` and `get_deployment()`, since these are read operations, it would be nice to avoid adding configuration arguments. Instead, can we consider how to embed region information into the deployment's `target_uri`? Ideally, the `target_uri` should specify the relevant AWS account and region containing the endpoint(s).\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch for your contributions! I'll take a look at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4971 shortly - I like how we're initially introducing the plugin as `@experimental` and leaving the preexisting solution intact - that's awesome!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/957126057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5552971647,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx847iBjrzwAAAAFK-59_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5552971647","actor":{"login":"jamestran201","id":15841903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQxOTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15841903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201","html_url":"https://github.com/jamestran201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-02T06:05:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5552971650,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx847iBjrzwAAAAFK-5-C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5552971650","actor":{"login":"jamestran201","id":15841903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQxOTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15841903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201","html_url":"https://github.com/jamestran201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-02T06:05:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/958171295","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4816#issuecomment-958171295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4816","id":958171295,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx845HIif","user":{"login":"jamestran201","id":15841903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQxOTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15841903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201","html_url":"https://github.com/jamestran201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestran201/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"created_at":"2021-11-02T21:13:58Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T21:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dbczumar
