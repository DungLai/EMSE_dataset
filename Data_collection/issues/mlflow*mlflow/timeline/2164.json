The artifact uploading is working apropriately but when I've try to download by MLFlow UI the page \"Something went wrong\" appears and no error log is shown at server console. \r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be with UI layer. When I've run the MLFlow UI with browse console opened, a error message was thrown:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreact-dom.production.min.js:151 Error: Can't find child.\r\n    at ArtifactUtils.js:50\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Function.value (ArtifactUtils.js:46)\r\n    at t.value (ArtifactView.js:171)\r\n    at t.value (ArtifactView.js:66)\r\n    at t.value (ArtifactView.js:87)\r\n    at t.value (ArtifactView.js:211)\r\n    at p (react-dom.production.min.js:131)\r\n    at beginWork (react-dom.production.min.js:138)\r\n    at i (react-dom.production.min.js:176)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, the function _findChild_ at _ArtifactUtil.js_ was not caring about the value \"\" of variable \"_part_\". I my case, the variable _path_ contained the value: \"/artefatos/1/5d6fdd11e9d84c78a95cbd565c2e031f/artifacts/Treinamento.xlsx\" and after the \"split\" operation, the value of \"_parts_\" with index=0 contained a blank string.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  static findChild(node, path) {\r\n    const parts = path.split('/');\r\n    let ret = node;\r\n    parts.forEach((part) => {\r\n      if (ret.children && ret.children[part] !== undefined) {  // <== the error occurs HERE!!\r\n        ret = ret.children[part];\r\n      } else {\r\n        throw new Error(\"Can't find child.\");\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n    return ret;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it a bug or is it my misleading?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n

also had the same issue. My remote tracking server uses a local sqlite file as backend-store and an remote FTP (NAS) server as the artifact-store. MLflow UI has the artifacts 'listed' correctly but when I click on the file for preview/download purpose it shows: \"Something went wrong\". The artifact_uri in the sqlite database is registered as \"ftp://<username>:<password>@<host_ip>:path_to_artifact\".\r\n\r\nActually I was also trying to use the same FTP as the sqlite backend-store but I could never succeeded because of sqlite has no permission to write to the mounted FTP folder. I have tried to change the folder permission very extensively but same problem persist even the folder permission was already \"drwx-rwx-rwx\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/693198696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenguo06","id":3402731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI3MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3402731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06","html_url":"https://github.com/glenguo06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenguo06/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
