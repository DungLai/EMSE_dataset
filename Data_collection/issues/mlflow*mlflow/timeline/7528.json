think that @WeichenXu123 may have a valid point. `MlflowClient.log_batch` is a bit complex here. It requires the user to construct those array + dictionary in order to use it.\r\n\r\n__Alternative 1__\r\n\r\nWe can name maybe the method just `log`. For tags, I think the verb we use is `set`, it users will not map that to the action `log`. Additionally, not sure if we could also add `artifacts` as another parameter so the user will always call `log`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef log(\r\n    params: Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.Param] | None = None,\r\n    metrics: Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.Metric] | None = None\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.log(\r\n    metrics=[\r\n        mlflow.tracking.MetricSeries(\"metric1\", values=[1, 4], steps=[0, 1], timestamps[1, 2]),\r\n        mlflow.tracking.MetricSeries(\"metric2\", values=[1, 4], steps=[0, 1], timestamps[1, 2])\r\n    ]\r\n}   \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may add a way to construct the metric data as needed, so we avoid users writing all the time the metric they want. It also makes it simpler to plug in the data as returned from ML frameworks (like for instance, tensorflow training history).\r\n\r\n__Alternative 2__\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef log(\r\n    params: dict[str, Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.ParamValue] | None = None,\r\n    metrics: dict[str, Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.MetricValue] | None = None,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.log(\r\n    metrics={\r\n        \"metric1\": [\r\n            {\"value\": 1 \"step\": 0, \"timestamp\": 1},\r\n            {\"value\": 4 \"step\": 1, \"timestamp\": 2}\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis is more close to what a user will do and it won't require repeating yourself that much (for the metric name key).

I think that @WeichenXu123 may have a valid point. `MlflowClient.log_batch` is a bit complex here. It requires the user to construct those array + dictionary in order to use it.\r\n> \r\n> **Alternative 1**\r\n> \r\n> We can name maybe the method just `log`. For tags, I think the verb we use is `set`, it users will not map that to the action `log`. Additionally, not sure if we could also add `artifacts` as another parameter so the user will always call `log`.\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> def log(\r\n>     params: Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.Param] | None = None,\r\n>     metrics: Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.Metric] | None = None\r\n> )\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Usage:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> mlflow.log(\r\n>     metrics=[\r\n>         mlflow.tracking.MetricSeries(\"metric1\", values=[1, 4], steps=[0, 1], timestamps[1, 2]),\r\n>         mlflow.tracking.MetricSeries(\"metric2\", values=[1, 4], steps=[0, 1], timestamps[1, 2])\r\n>     ]\r\n> }   \r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> We may add a way to construct the metric data as needed, so we avoid users writing all the time the metric they want. It also makes it simpler to plug in the data as returned from ML frameworks (like for instance, tensorflow training history).\r\n> \r\n> **Alternative 2**\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> def log(\r\n>     params: dict[str, Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.ParamValue] | None = None,\r\n>     metrics: dict[str, Sequence[dict | mlflow.entities.MetricValue] | None = None,\r\n> )\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Usage:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> mlflow.log(\r\n>     metrics={\r\n>         \"metric1\": [\r\n>             {\"value\": 1 \"step\": 0, \"timestamp\": 1},\r\n>             {\"value\": 4 \"step\": 1, \"timestamp\": 2}\r\n>         ]\r\n>     }\r\n> )\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This is more close to what a user will do and it won't require repeating yourself that much (for the metric name key).\r\n\r\nAlternative 2 is awesome!
