is a key features. Arbitrarily increasing the size of tag values may affect the performance of logging and searching over large values. One of the recommendations would be to  use [plugins to customize some of this functionality](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html) to allow large artifacts to be logged. Another negative of having large blobs logged as tags is increased I/O when searching and listing runs (since the data models pushes all data when a run is fetched).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the UX with large blobs showing up as tags for a run (on run page) or a column on an experiment page needs to be worked out.\r\n\r\nWhile ability to log large data as tags would be nice, the benefit of having this large data blob stored as tag vs artifact is not clear. Here are a couple of alternatives to be able to do achieve what you are trying to do.\r\n\r\n### Log each feature importance value as a tag (or metric)\r\n```\r\nfor (feature_name, importance_value) in features.items():\r\n  key = \"feature_importance.{}\".format(feature_name)\r\n  mlflow.log_metric(key, importance_value)\r\n```\r\nThis will make searchability using a specific feature value and importance (`\"metrics.feature_importance.sq_footage > 0.45\"`) or order runs based on feature importance like\r\n\r\n```\r\nsearch_runs(filter = \"metrics.error_rate < 0.2 AND params.model_type = 'tensorflow'\",\r\n            order_by = [\"metrics.feature_importance.sq_footage\", \"metrics.feature_importance.inventory DESC\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### As recommended before log the entire feature blob as an artifact\r\nYou can create a handy function log features\r\n```\r\ndef log_features(features):\r\n    with TempDir() as tmp:\r\n        feature_path = tmp.path(\"features.csv\")\r\n        with open(feature_path, \"w\") as writer:\r\n            data = \"\\n\".join(\"{},{}\".format(k, v) for (k, v) in sorted(features.items()))\r\n            writer.write(data)\r\n        mlflow.log_artifact(feature_path)\r\n```\r\nThis has a benefit of being stored with the run and unlike tags cannot be overwritten.\r\n\r\nI am closing this issue out as a duplicate of
