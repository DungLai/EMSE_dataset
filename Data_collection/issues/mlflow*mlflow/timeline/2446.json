Create a new run nested under `run_id` when calling `mlflow.start_run(run_id=run_id, nested=True)`. This somewhat complicates the behavior of the `run_id` parameter, as based on the `nested` flag we'd either resume & reset attributes of an existing run or create a new run that doesn't have the passed-in run ID, but rather is nested under it (would need to document this). It's also a behavior change that I'd be hesitant to make (though it seems pretty unlikely that people are relying on the current behavior of `mlflow.start_run(run_id=run_id, nested=True)`, where `nested=True` is just ignored, and maybe the fact that `nested` is ignored is more confusing).\r\n2. Correct the documentation of the `nested` parameter to explain that it's only accounted for if a new run is created (i.e. that it's ignored if `run_id` is specified). Could also consider throwing if `run_id` is supplied along with other parameters, but this might break existing workflows.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I kinda like option 2, although I do think the syntax in option 1 is more concise - for 2.0 maybe we should separate out or otherwise clarify APIs for resuming runs vs creating nested
