@yl790. I just pushed some tests I forgot to push to my [xgboost PR](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3085/files). I think these tests could be taken more or less 1 to 1 for h2o - and they are more comprehensive than the ones for keras, namely because they also test non-R / R API interactions. Also, I modified some util functions for creating `conda_env.yaml`, (see the diff in the PR) because previously, the structure of the file did not match the one that resulted from saving an xgb model from the Python API.
