This is not possible with `crate` or `python_function` flavor alone.\r\n* Convenience: In the python API, every model could be stored as `python_function` but I think it is the same as with crate: These require more boilerplate code, so it's nicer to use the designated flavors to store and load.\r\n\r\nDo you think we'd still need a parsnip and a recipes flavor then or is workflows enough?

Some of the questions below are probably just a result of me not having found the right documentation. \r\n\r\n * Most of these points are also true for `caret` and (probably) `mlr3`. \r\n * My first inclination is to standardize tidymodels objects on workflows (and not `parsnip` `model_fit` objects). Workflows know a lot more about the underlying data that goes into the model. \r\n * It would be helpful to have a reference to a specification of what `mlflow` needs for a model in order to be deployed. For example, I've seen [examples](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-signature) with JSON for the inputs and outputs but can't find documentation of this. The same would be true for package requirements. Is there a specification for declaring those?\r\n * I suspect that there needs to be some transition code between the data that is served to the model and the format that the model expects. For example, a character input will mostly likely need to be converted to an appropriate factor encoding. Same for input strings representing dates (and so on). Maybe I have not need seen the right docs but it is unclear what an R model object would expect for data inputs. \r\n * We've thought about the autologging parts too (this may be a bit of a rant). The R model frameworks (including tidymodels) would probably make the user experience much better than what I've seen in the wild. This maybe a tangent but I believe that most people developing models in R would _not_ use experiments to manage the model development process. We've had longstanding api's that replicate that functionality in an R session (complete with distributed computing).  There are other cultural differences that make the experiment/run structure very kludgy for R users.

Thank you so much for having a look at this. And thank you for all of your `tidymodels` work. I agree that it suffices to support workflows.\r\n\r\nI can't say I've seen MLflow signatures before. I haven't seen them implemented in R, at least. Presumably they would be part of the `MLmodel` YAML file that accompanies every saved model, but I'd have to dig into the Python side to find out how they're encoded. In my implementation, an `MLmodel` for workflows looks like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npath: \".../model/path\",\r\nflavors:\r\n    workflow:\r\n        data: workflow.rds,\r\n        model: rand_forest,\r\n        engine: engine,\r\n        mode: regression\r\n```\r\n\r\nMLflow serves a REST API that can accept either JSON or CSV (or static HTML, which I think we can ignore here). Looking at [the source code for the R side of MLflow serve](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7bba35ceed7ac3219622583a2041cc4af4801159/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model-serve.R#L50), it appears as though  [JSON is parsed with `jsonlite`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7bba35ceed7ac3219622583a2041cc4af4801159/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model-serve.R#L100) and [CSV with read.csv](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7bba35ceed7ac3219622583a2041cc4af4801159/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model-serve.R#L191), so the model developer would need to handle the deserialising process themselves. Kind of like `plumber`, although `plumber` comes with handy tools for doing this translation. You're right though, in that this would be a problem faced by `crate`, a `caret` flavour, or any other implementation of a model in R.\r\n\r\nI'd be very keen to hear more about your thoughts on autologging and R, and these R APIs, but it sounds like I may be jumping the gun a bit by trying to implement autologging in MLflow?

I couldn't get it shorter:\r\n\r\n## parsnip vs workflows\r\n\r\n> My first inclination is to standardize tidymodels objects on workflows (and not parsnip model_fit objects). Workflows know a lot more about the underlying data that goes into the model.\r\n\r\nMakes total sense.\r\n\r\n## reference specification and deployment\r\n\r\n> It would be helpful to have a reference to a specification of what mlflow needs for a model in order to be deployed. \r\n\r\nJust to make sure we are on the same page here, we should clarify: The minimal requirements for a flavour in R are an S3 generic for `mlflow_save_model()`, `mlflow_log_model()`, `mlflow_load_model()` and `mlflow_predict()` like for crate (or what I added for `{xgboost}` in #3085) as well as writing `MLmodel` as a side effect with `mlflow_save_model()` and `mlflow_log_model()` (see crate). To my knowledge, all supported [deployment tools](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#built-in-deployment-tools) (if you meant that with *deployment*) are based on the `python_function` flavour. For deployment, a `python_function` is packaged in a conda environment inside a docker container that runs a [web-server](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#mlflow-server) to expose the model. This is where things get a bit tricky because we'd either need conda or renv support first for flavours, then add docker support (as tracked in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3817). My suggestion is to implement the tidymodels flavour first not thinking about virtual envs and docker first, because it's really pretty much the code @mdneuzerling has written above. The virtual envs and docker parts should also then be leveraged by all R flavours. In particular, the same way all Python based flavours such as `python_function`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch` etc. leverage `python_function` for deployment, it probably makes sense that all R flavours use the R equivalent `crate` for deployment. \r\n\r\nTo deploy as web service in databricks via the model registry, I think docker support is a pre-condition. At least I [could not deploy a simple crate model](https://forums.databricks.com/questions/55512/support-for-serving-r-models-through-model-registr.html). Loading a model in an R session from the model registry works.\r\n\r\n## Signatures\r\n\r\nTo second @mdneuzerling, signatures are not implemented in the R client to my knowledge for any flavors, so I'd treat this as a separate topic from this issue. We can always add this later, e.g. when we think about deployment of the flavours. Before signatures were implemented in python (like 3 months ago), deployment also worked without it.\r\n\r\n## Input data types\r\n\r\n> I suspect that there needs to be some transition code between the data that is served to the model and the format that the model expects. For example, a character input will mostly likely need to be converted to an appropriate factor encoding. Same for input strings representing dates (and so on). Maybe I have not need seen the right docs but it is unclear what an R model object would expect for data inputs.\r\n\r\nIf you access a model from R, you can do everything R can handle. E.g. for `crate()`, I can supply a custom `vctrs` class (and then do whatever I want inside the crated function). If you access/make available the model over the above mentioned web server/Python/CLI, you are probably more limited to typical types like int, string and logical as @mdneuzerling has elaborated above. Anyways, it makes sense to handle conversion inside the `{workflow}` and not use data types that are not well-defined outside R in the user-facing API of a flavour (e.g. as the input of a workflow model when running `mlflow_predict()`). \r\n\r\n> Kind of like plumber, although plumber comes with handy tools for doing this translation\r\n\r\nYes, but the user in mlflow would get the data already processed by the plumber part (the web server into int, str or logical) and has no control over this deserialization. `{recipes}` has probably all the functions to do the conversions inside the worfklow (side note: ML deployment was the reason why I asked to support arbitrary transformations in recipes: https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/576). So I don't see this as a problem. I'd revisit that later when we look into signatures, not sure data types could be derived from it. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Autologging\r\n> We've thought about the autologging parts too (this may be a bit of a rant). The R model frameworks (including tidymodels) would probably make the user experience much better than what I've seen in the wild. This maybe a tangent but I believe that most people developing models in R would not use experiments to manage the model development process. We've had longstanding api's that replicate that functionality in an R session (complete with distributed computing). There are other cultural differences that make the experiment/run structure very kludgy for R users. We can replicate those structures so that mlflow could be used but the R api's would be very different from what the user would do with the R mlflow package api's.\r\n\r\nI vote to discuss that later and not in this issue too ;D. Not sure what you saw in the wild. And not sure I get what you mean with *most people developing models in R would not use experiments to manage the model development process*. In my opinion, the `with(mlflow_start_run(), {...})` API is not very R-ish, but you can also just use the imperative approach, which in my eyes is almost what I'd do without mlflow anyways. \r\n```r\r\nlibrary(mlflow)\r\nlibrary(xgboost)\r\nmlflow_start_run()\r\n\r\ndata(agaricus.train, package = \"xgboost\")\r\ndata(agaricus.test, package = \"xgboost\")\r\n\r\ndtrain <- xgb.DMatrix(agaricus.train$data, label = agaricus.train$label)\r\ndtest <- xgb.DMatrix(agaricus.test$data, label = agaricus.test$label)\r\nwatchlist <- list(train = dtrain, eval = dtest)\r\n\r\n## from xgboost docs\r\nparam <- list(\r\n  max_depth = 2, eta = 1, verbose = 0, nthread = 2,\r\n  objective = \"binary:logistic\", eval_metric = \"auc\"\r\n)\r\nbst <- xgb.train(param, dtrain, nrounds = 2, watchlist)\r\n\r\n# this is what you want to autolog. In sklearn, they did it with patching the base learners\r\n# in my understanding; https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2050. We could patch\r\n# the fit method in {parsnip} and friends.\r\n\r\n# mlflow::mlflow_log_param('rmse', 'value')\r\n# mlflow::mlflow_log_param('n-variables', 'value')\r\n# mlflow::mlflow_log_param('n-obs', 'value')\r\n# mlflow::mlflow_log_param('n-iterations-fittin', 'value')\r\n\r\nmlflow_save_model(f, \"model\")\r\nmlflow::mlflow_end_run()\r\n```\r\nAs I said, I think this is a separate discussion and for autologging, a tidymodels flavour is a pre-condition.\r\n\r\n> Model developers can always manually log parameters and metrics one-by-one in the current version of MLflow.\r\n\r\nI agree. Later, we can eliminate boilerplate code in ML code and increase consistency by adapting auto logging.\r\n\r\n## My conclusion\r\n\r\n* As a first step, implement the tidymodels flavour for workflow objects as @mdneuzerling suggested above and using common helper functions used in the R implementation of xgboost and h2o and tensorflow etc. models.\r\n* allow to save the tidymodels flavour as `crate` function so we can think about deploying all R models via `crate` the same way all python functions are deployed as `python_function` (lambda-like). This requires docker support as discussed in as tracked in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3817 and potentially conda/renv support.\r\n* Discuss autologging in a follow-up issue.\r\n\r\ncc:
