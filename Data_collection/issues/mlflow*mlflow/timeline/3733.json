One thing to note is that at the time we added pagination to SearchRuns, MLflow did not yet have a stable REST API - now that MLflow's REST API is stable, we'll need to think about how to add pagination in a way that doesn't break existing use cases. \r\n\r\nAs one idea, we could introduce a `max_results` parameter to ListExperiments (similar to SearchRuns, see its [REST API docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#search-runs)), and apply pagination if `max_results` is present. That way (below 'old' = before the ListExperiments change, 'new' = after the change):\r\n* Old clients talking to new servers will continue to see all experiments returned when hitting the ListExperiments REST API\r\n* New clients can pass `max_results` to enable pagination. We'd need to document the behavior of `max_results` carefully - when talking to an old server, `max_results` will be ignored, but it will be honored when talking to a new server.\r\n* Conveniently, the presence/absence of a `next_page_token` indicates whether more pages are present for both old and new servers\r\n\r\nDefinitely open to solutions that result in a simpler API, since the behavior of `max_results` here is kinda confusing - for example we could consider adding a new endpoint for paginated listing of

That makes total sense, thank you! I'm relatively new to the MLflow project, so I don't have a great intuitive sense yet for what feels most appropriate to this codebase. I've already done some playing around with adding a `max_results` param and it wouldn't be much work to clean that up and make sure it's backwards compatible (i.e. your first option). That said, if you're ok with expanding your API surface area, the cleanest option probably is the new endpoint - avoiding surprises for users and back compat headaches for us sounds ideal.\r\n\r\nIf we're good to go with that, I'll be able to have a first draft PR up sometime next week to facilitate more discussion. Even if the user API is fairly straightforward, there'll be some fine points about the ListExperiments internals and what can be reused that'll be good to talk over. I'll also need to get in touch with someone eventually about the .proto files and doing the associated autogeneration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/742834351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wamartin-aml","id":42586848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTg2ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42586848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml","html_url":"https://github.com/wamartin-aml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4097485284,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA5NzQ4NTI4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4097485284","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-10T22:15:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4097485287,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwOTc0ODUyODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4097485287","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-10T22:15:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/824393517","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3733#issuecomment-824393517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3733","id":824393517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDM5MzUxNw==","user":{"login":"ernestklchan","id":37346936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzQ2OTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37346936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan","html_url":"https://github.com/ernestklchan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ernestklchan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-21T22:17:21Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T22:17:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As
