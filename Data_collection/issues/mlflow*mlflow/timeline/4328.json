Samuel,\r\n\r\nThanks for the feature request and your willingness to contribute! \r\n\r\nI manage the team at Databricks that supports the Model Registry. We discussed supporting more flexible stages in model registry. However, adding arbitrary custom stages may introduce incompatibilities with existing stages - for example, the None stage is already treated differently from Staging and Production. Instead, we are considering supporting sub-stages so users could have fine-grained controls of the model lifecycle, and we think that this will be easier to support compatibility across different MLflow versions and installations. For example, under \"Production\" stage, you could have customized substages, e.g. \"Production/live-a\", \"Production/live-b\" for A/B testing. Would such substages work for your use case? \r\n\r\nWe wonâ€™t be able to get to the sub-stage project immediately due to prioritization. In the meantime, we recommend using tags to annotate the model stages beyond \"Staging\" and \"Production\". \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions. We are happy to have a discussion to better understand your use case.
