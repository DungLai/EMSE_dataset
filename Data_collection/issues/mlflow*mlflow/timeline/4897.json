I would like to work on this issue.\r\n\r\nTalking about the issue, it seems that we are incorrectly passing a value to the argument `error_code` in function `_handle_serving_error`.\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b945297a85d7a9998543bb108e80c838c66cff07/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py#L80-L89\r\n\r\nThe function `_handle_serving_error` then passes the value `MALFORMED_REQUEST` to a `MlflowException constructor`. \r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b945297a85d7a9998543bb108e80c838c66cff07/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py#L203\r\n\r\nIn `MlflowException constructor`, it sets the value `MALFORMED_REQUEST`, which is not defined. So, probably the code goes to an exception, where error_code stores a value `ErrorCode.Name(INTERNAL_ERROR)`.\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b945297a85d7a9998543bb108e80c838c66cff07/mlflow/exceptions.py#L49-L52\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `MALFORMED_REQUEST` has not been defined in [mlflow/exceptions.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b945297a85d7a9998543bb108e80c838c66cff07/mlflow/exceptions.py)\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b945297a85d7a9998543bb108e80c838c66cff07/mlflow/exceptions.py#L3-L28\r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways to fix this issue:\r\n1. Instead of passing `MALFORMED_REQUEST`, we need to pass `BAD_REQUEST`. I would prefer this option.\r\n2. Define `MALFORMED_REQUEST` in [mlflow/exceptions.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/b945297a85d7a9998543bb108e80c838c66cff07/mlflow/exceptions.py)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/956163699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"abatomunkuev","id":55283735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjgzNzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55283735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev","html_url":"https://github.com/abatomunkuev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abatomunkuev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5548401756,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx849I6FtzwAAAAFKteRc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5548401756","actor":{"login":"mmaitre314","id":8584604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODQ2MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8584604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314","html_url":"https://github.com/mmaitre314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-01T11:43:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5548401758,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx849I6FtzwAAAAFKteRe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5548401758","actor":{"login":"mmaitre314","id":8584604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODQ2MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8584604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314","html_url":"https://github.com/mmaitre314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmaitre314/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-01T11:43:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/959758538","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4897#issuecomment-959758538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4897","id":959758538,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx845NMDK","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T17:27:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T17:27:43Z","

I have created a Pull Request. However, when I was performing tests by running the following command\r\n```\r\npytest tests/pyfunc --large\r\n```\r\nSome tests have failed since I have changed the code in `scoring_server/__init__.py`. I am a little bit confused. Should I change the existing tests in `test_scoring_server.py` ? If so, could you help me to find which test function needs to be updated so that it respects the changes. \r\n\r\nThank
