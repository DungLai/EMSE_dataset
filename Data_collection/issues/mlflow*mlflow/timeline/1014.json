usecase actually has not much to do with this issue, I was just thankful to read this line:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommand: \"Rscript -e 'mlflow::mlflow_source(train.R)' --args --alpha={alpha} --lambda={lambda}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo maybe I should have refrained from commenting here (and just submitted the PR). My goal was simply to make use of the MLprojects feature, which I believe is great - and I thought should be documented so other people can use it. I wanted to use it because I can specify default values for all parameters in one file for example. I have not investigated if and how other features such as Kubernetes or running on databricks work / don't work for the R API.
