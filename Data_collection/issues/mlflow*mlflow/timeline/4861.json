just found out that this issue is duplicated with [this issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1116) right after I hit the submit button (sorry guys).\r\n\r\nAccording to [the answer](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1116#issuecomment-481813861), the root issue is that when we run `mlflow run <project_name>` it actually uses the Python of the base environment, in which there is no `mlflow` installed (although I run the `mlflow run` command in my working environment that already installed MLFlow).\r\n\r\n_I get to know this diagnosis by running `where python` when I activate the conda environment that MLFLow created for the project, and it shows 2 python versions. Then, when I run `python` in that environment, it prints the version of Python in the base environment._\r\n\r\n**Solution**: I install MLFlow in the base environment, and voila everything works okay. \r\n\r\nIf this keeps happening to everyone out there then we should have a solution for this issue.\r\n\r\nI'm closing the issue for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/932193691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tranctan","id":42478131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDc4MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42478131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan","html_url":"https://github.com/tranctan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5394140995,"node_id":"CE_lADOCB5Jx848ZUuqzwAAAAFBhA9D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5394140995","actor":{"login":"tranctan","id":42478131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDc4MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42478131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan","html_url":"https://github.com/tranctan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T12:43:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/932256761","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4861#issuecomment-932256761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4861","id":932256761,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx843kRv5","user":{"login":"tranctan","id":42478131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDc4MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42478131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan","html_url":"https://github.com/tranctan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tranctan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-01T14:02:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-02T03:21:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

If python version isn't specified, the created env will use `base` python, that is, the one installed in your native environment not in the conda env. Even when the env is activated, the `pip` it uses also is the one installed in your native environment (`base`), which means using this `pip` will install mlflow in your `base` not the created conda env.

thank you for your dedicated response. Based on your response and some trials, somehow I found out the problem and fixed this, though I don't understand why the issue occurs. \r\n\r\nThe issue is about _activating multiple conda environments makes the second-activated environment uses Python from the `base` environment instead._ \r\n- This is why when I activate a conda environment that is not `base` environment (in this case, `test_mlflow` environment) and run `mlflow run`, it yields an issue of Python is from the `base` environment.\r\n\r\nStep to reproduce:\r\n- Create a conda environment, e.g `test_mlflow` with Python + `MLFlow` installed.\r\n- Activate `test_mlflow` & run `mlflow run sklearn_elasticnet_wine`\r\n- Then MLFlow Project creates new environment (`mlflow_<serial_number>`), runs the project and yields the error we talked about.\r\n\r\nReproduce again the error in more handy way:\r\n```\r\n(base) D:\\WORK\\mlflow\\examples>conda activate test_mlflow\r\n\r\n(test_mlflow) D:\\WORK\\mlflow\\examples>conda activate mlflow-f1d746bcf57e2f4f48709a3067a87365cc1f75c2\r\n\r\n(mlflow-f1d746bcf57e2f4f48709a3067a87365cc1f75c2) D:\\WORK\\mlflow\\examples>python\r\nPython 3.7.4 (default, Aug  9 2019, 18:34:13) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32\r\n\r\nWarning:\r\nThis Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has\r\nnot been activated.
