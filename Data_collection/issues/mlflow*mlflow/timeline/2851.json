Attempt to mount the host's docker socket when running docker containers for MLflow project execution as described in [the StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27879713/is-it-ok-to-run-docker-from-inside-docker/33003273#33003273).\r\n\r\nI think both of these would unblock your use case, but require code changes to MLflow.

It would be great if you could replicate it and validate my approach before doing a PR for that.
