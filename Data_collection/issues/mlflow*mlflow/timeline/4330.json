seems to me you are trying to store the html to build an iframe as an artifact in mlflow, that won't work.\r\nyou cant store an iframe as an artifact, an iframe is literally just a link to another website. Dash (which powers explainerdashboard) is not a static asset, it requires a flask server to run. \r\n\r\nHowever you can store the \"state\" of the explainerdashboard as an artifact and serve that through a flask route.\r\nSo log the dashboard.yaml and explainer.joblib with mlflow, and then loading the dashboard from config when serving it.\r\n\r\nso instead of using an iframe, you could return the html from the dash app. so following the explainer dashboard documentation: https://explainerdashboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html#deploying-dashboard-as-part-of-flask-app-on-specific-route\r\n\r\n```\r\ndashboard1 = ExplainerDashboard(explainer1)\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name='dummy'):\r\n\r\n   \r\n   mlflow.log_artifact(ExplainerDashboard.to_yaml(), \"dashboard\")\r\n   mlflow.log_artifact(explainer.dumps(), \"explainer\")\r\n```\r\nthen where you are serving your mlflow dashboard ( i did not test this code, but i was planning on developing something similar to what you want to do). (also i have never build an mlflow dashboard).\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom flask import Flask\r\n\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\n\r\n# fetch from mlflow storage\r\ndashboard_yaml = ...\r\nexplainer = ...\r\n\r\nedb = ExplainerDashboard(explainer,server=app,url_base_pathname=\"/dashboard/\").from_config(dashboard_yaml)\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.route('/dashboard')\r\ndef return_dashboard():\r\n    return db.app.index()\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe (flask) server running mlflow will need to initialize the dash application before its first request though, since dash does not run if it can't init before_first_request (so i don't know how well this will scale if you want to explain many different models). So if this simple \"single file\" flask structure will work, but if you want to use blueprints (which you should) there should be a dash.init_app somewhere before the first request.\r\n\r\nAlso i would recommend you to develop this in a docker container (using a PAAS can cause unforeseen issues when trying to serve dash as a flask/fastapi route).\r\n\r\nAnother route would be to try an create a static version of the dash app, but i don't think you could use frozen-flask for this. Maybe Oege Dijk over at explainerdashboard is interested in developing a static html version of the dashboard? the interactivity does not add that much in my view. If the entire dashboard were to be written in plotly components, you could store the html of the figures and log that in mlflow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/841831088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hugocool","id":25592581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTkyNTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25592581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool","html_url":"https://github.com/hugocool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugocool/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/842317937","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4330#issuecomment-842317937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4330","id":842317937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjMxNzkzNw==","user":{"login":"Simon-Free","id":58785686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Nzg1Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58785686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free","html_url":"https://github.com/Simon-Free","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T13:19:18Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T13:27:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Okay, thank you a lot for your answer ! I will clarify a few points, which were probably unclear in my previous comment. I do have two servers, the first running mlflow, the second running my dashboards. For example, my mlflow server will run on `http:\\\\127.0.0.1:5000` and my second server is also up and running at `http:\\\\127.0.0.1:8001`.\r\n\r\n My iframe simply contains an adress, e.g. `http:\\\\127.0.0.1:8001\\custom_dashboard_number_1234`, that emmit a request to my dashboard server, when the artifact is loaded. The problem is not due to a non-running server, but is caused by what is called a \"Cross-Origin Request\", i.e. a web-page loading informations from two differents servers. The CORS (cross origin resources sharing) being blocked by default by most of the navigators, the dashboard cannot be loaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, it DOES work using [some navigator extension](https://mybrowseraddon.com/access-control-allow-origin.html?v=0.1.6&type=install). \r\n\r\nBut this is not a good solution, since using this extension is not advised for production purposes. So I'm looking for another way to allow this. It seems that you can allow it with some http headers, but I don't know where to place it in the source code of mlflow/flask. Another solution could be to manually get and run the `app` object from `mlflow.server` and add some other `@app.route`, but it would probably not work without some more effort for the ExplainerDashboard, since it generates it's own app.\r\n\r\nFinally, to be honest, I first tried to make some \"static\" dashboard using plotly, but the tool is really not made for it... Doing a \"simple\" two-levels-filtering requires some nasty hacks, is completely not optimal, consumes a lot of memory, ect. Some better tricks might be available, but I spent a few days on this question without finding something satisfying. The best result being [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61556618/plotly-how-to-display-and-filter-a-dataframe-with-multiple-dropdowns), but it is really, really not scalable as is.\r\n\r\nSo using some static html seems to be excluded, at least with plotly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/842317937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Simon-Free","id":58785686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Nzg1Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58785686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free","html_url":"https://github.com/Simon-Free","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Simon-Free/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
