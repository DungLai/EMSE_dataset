So, for the missing functionality, such as autologging, I'm afraid that we just don't have that implementation prioritized, opting instead to work on features within the Python API. \r\nThat being said, we would certainly not turn down a submission for a solution (although the complexity of implementing this will likely be extreme). \r\nTo answer each of your questions:\r\n1. None. You can't do it with the current version.\r\n2. There are none. Since autologging relies on patching of invoked methods during runtime, any Java or Scala models that are running would need to have runtime inspection implemented in those languages to enable features such as this. While entirely possible, it's just not something that is even remotely close to the top of our list of priorities for MLflow.\r\n3. In the PythonAPI, for PySpark models, auto-logging is fully featured (with the exception of the soon-to-be-implemented signature and example auto-logging, which will hopefully be released in either the next release version or the one after that). There simply is no similar functionality (metrics, params, artifacts, etc. all must be logged manually with calls to the JavaAPI wrapper around the Python APIs).\r\n4. The current supported (as of MLflow 1.24.0) version of scala is 2.12.6 as per https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mlflow/mlflow-spark/1.24.0 . This isn't to say that it won't work with scala 2.13 (you can always fork MLflow, update the POM, and use maven to build a version with your required scala runtime and see if it works); we simply haven't tested it with 2.13. Yet. We'll be taking a look at this since Spark 3.2.0 introduced support for 2.13 in November. \r\n5. Spark 3.2.0 and 3.2.1 are built on scala 2.12 and scala 2.13: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.spark/spark-core. It'll work fine! :) \r\n\r\nHope that helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1071905397/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6262999315,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85F43CLzwAAAAF1TckT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6262999315","actor":{"login":"sreerama-naga","id":26213170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjEzMTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26213170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga","html_url":"https://github.com/sreerama-naga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-18T00:39:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6262999318,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85F43CLzwAAAAF1TckW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6262999318","actor":{"login":"sreerama-naga","id":26213170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjEzMTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26213170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga","html_url":"https://github.com/sreerama-naga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-18T00:39:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1072023920","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5506#issuecomment-1072023920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5506","id":1072023920,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx84_5clw","user":{"login":"sreerama-naga","id":26213170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjEzMTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26213170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga","html_url":"https://github.com/sreerama-naga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-18T04:36:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T12:10:39Z","a

thank so much for the details.

But what I am not sure how far logging as artifact compete with log_model in behavior wise from the mlflow ui and also not sure whether this way it will be treated as model.\r\nOr\r\nMay be it is not good idea to send models as artifacts as it needs to be stored as a fie for artifact.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1072023920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sreerama-naga","id":26213170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjEzMTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26213170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga","html_url":"https://github.com/sreerama-naga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreerama-naga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6263827421,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85F43CLzwAAAAF1Wmvd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6263827421","actor":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-18T04:36:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6263827424,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85F43CLzwAAAAF1Wmvg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6263827424","actor":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-18T04:36:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1072931822","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5506#issuecomment-1072931822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5506","id":1072931822,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx84_86Pu","user":{"login":"amesar","id":1721873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1721873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar","html_url":"https://github.com/amesar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-19T03:45:50Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T03:45:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The
