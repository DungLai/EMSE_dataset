This would be critical for integrating with external services\r\n* Many parts of the UI would not respond to the tagged semantic version (i.e. registered model page)\r\n* Tags can be edited/deleted independent of the registered model object whereas the true model version cannot be changed after creation (more resistant to accidental tampering)\r\n* It feels odd to use a tag key for a model property which already exists. This might cause confusion in team communication\r\n\r\nI understand this might be lower priority, but it still seems like a useful feature in the

I can add some suggestion to this FR:\r\n\r\nIn my company we are designing automatic training and deployment of fresh models in production.\r\nIn this case we need to have versioning pattern **that will let for distinguishing following changes in the model**:\r\n- a) new version of model breaks backward compatibility (inference method new signature is not backward compatible)\r\n- b) new version of model is backward compatible, but there was some code change in ML Project\r\n- c) new version of model is produced using the same ML Project code, but with differed (newer) training data set\r\n\r\nThis distinction is fully coherent with Semantic Versioning. And accordingly using `major.minor.patch` pattern we will:\r\n - a) bump `major` number when breaking backward compatibility\r\n - b) bump `minor` number when preserving backward compatibility but introducing code changes in ML Project\r\n - c) bump `patch` number when just retraining model using the same ML Project code","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1329412578/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cristofp","id":4295054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTUwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4295054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp","html_url":"https://github.com/cristofp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristofp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1329427302","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7280#issuecomment-1329427302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7280","id":1329427302,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85PPXNm","user":{"login":"addisonklinke","id":39926682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTI2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39926682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke","html_url":"https://github.com/addisonklinke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-28T16:53:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T16:53:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cristofp yes exactly!
