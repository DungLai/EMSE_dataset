It looks like we can add support for including run name in the downloaded CSV by modifying the logic in ExperimentView.runInfosToCsv (defined [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/76fa8cb/mlflow/server/js/src/components/ExperimentView.js#L650), called [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/76fa8cb/mlflow/server/js/src/components/ExperimentView.js#L591)). Specifically we should be able to pass `this.props.tagsList` to `runInfosToCsv` and use `Utils.getRunName(tagsList[index])` to get the run name from the set of tags [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/components/ExperimentView.js#L681).\r\n\r\nThis could be a good starter issue for getting familiar with React / contributing to the MLflow UI ([see instructions](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#running-the-javascript-dev-server) for running the dev UI) - would you be interested in making a PR with the change?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/459622520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2111396363,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjExMTM5NjM2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2111396363","actor":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-01T06:35:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2111396364,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMTEzOTYzNjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2111396364","actor":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-01T06:35:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/459706322","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/856#issuecomment-459706322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/856","id":459706322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTcwNjMyMg==","user":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":
