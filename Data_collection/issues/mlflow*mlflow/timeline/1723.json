Apologies for the very substantial delay here. In the time since this issue was filed, we've introduced several APIs to make it easier to log artifacts, such as `mlflow.log_image()` (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_image) and `mlflow.log_text()` (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_text), which automatically handle persistence of artifact content to files, logging, and file cleanup. Accordingly, I'm going to go ahead and close this issue for now. Please feel free to reopen it if you believe there's significantly more work to be done.
