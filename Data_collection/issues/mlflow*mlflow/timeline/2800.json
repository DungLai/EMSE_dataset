thank you for raising this issue and finding relevant parts of our implementation!\r\n\r\nThe `conda-env` parameter in MLproject is intended to capture the dependencies required to run code in MLflow in a reproducible way. Needing a wheel in dbfs breaks the reproducibility across different environments, but perhaps that's okay in your context and could be managed outside of the MLproject format.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the behavior of the running MLprojects on Databricks, there are two relevant limitations here:\r\n- the conda environment is only installed on the driver\r\n- there's no easy way to reference a wheel from a conda environment\r\n\r\nIn your example, `libraries` is not a recognized field in the field that is accepted in the command (https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs.html#jobsclusterspecnewcluster). In this case, your example wouldn't be expected to work. \r\n\r\nThis would need some additional design on how to pass additional libraries to the cluster specification that gets constructed, as it would have to be defined outside the `cluster.json`. We'd also want to think through its impact on reproducibility. \r\n\r\nOne thing that would be helpful for us is to understand the use case a bit better - what aspects of the MLproject formats are you particularly looking to leverage that go beyond what the Databrick's job APIs provide?

for your reply!\r\n\r\nMy requirements is quite simple. The code I'm writing requires some third-party libraries to be installed on computing nodes, not only on the driver's side. \r\n\r\nFor example, we're using maxmind GeoLocation libraries (maxminddb) to perform large-scale preprocessing, so, library maxminddb need to be present on workers. That's not the only example, but rather quite generic requirements to be able to specify cluster's workers configuration.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm using mlflow via databricks-connect, I'm specifying already configured cluster, so, it's not a problem to install any set of packages. I want to be able to do the same when I'm running mlflow job with `-b databricks -c cluster.json` mode.\r\n\r\nIn theory, it is possible to solve in a hacky way by running `pip install` or doing `SparkContext.addFile`, but that becomes a mess in a large project with several dependencies.\r\n\r\nSo, ideal solution will be to have a way to specify set of packages to be installed on a cluster

You should be able to log to MLflow from these jobs, you'll just need to be sure to include MLflow in the libraries if you are using the Databricks Runtime. MLflow is installed on the Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning. Would this unblock you while we work on a more integrated solution?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/626889575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3324313098,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMyNDMxMzA5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3324313098","actor":{"login":"Shmuma","id":66154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma","html_url":"https://github.com/Shmuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T18:52:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3324313100,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMjQzMTMxMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3324313100","actor":{"login":"Shmuma","id":66154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma","html_url":"https://github.com/Shmuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T18:52:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/628551757","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2800#issuecomment-628551757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2800","id":628551757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODU1MTc1Nw==","user":{"login":"Shmuma","id":66154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma","html_url":"https://github.com/Shmuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-14T10:45:17Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T10:45:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for suggesting!\r\n\r\nI've quickly skimmed through jobs api documentation, but found it quite limited in comparison to mlflow functionality.

Let assuming that you don't want to wait for (3), let me know which approach you would like to pursue among (1) and (2).\r\n\r\n**Approach 1.** With the `spark_python_task`, library management for the workers and drivers would all be through the `libraries` block of the cluster specification, and would have a conda environment on the driver. The warning you see refers to the `spark_submit_task` task type, which is a different task type than the `spark_python_task`. However, your understanding is correct that the job is limited to referencing a single python file. You'd have to bundle up other code you depend on into a wheel or library and install that on the cluster.\r\n\r\n**Approach 2.** We're also considering on a patch to address this in the MLflow client to unblock this use case relatively quickly. It would have a quirk. You would need to specify the libraries you depend on in both the conda environment and the `libraries` property for cluster configuration, in slightly different ways. As you have a wheel in your previous example, I'm assuming you have a wheel uploaded to \r\n\r\nTo install wheels on the driver, in your conda yaml file:\r\n```\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - pip:\r\n    - /dbfs/path_to_my_lib.whl\r\n```\r\nNotice that the path to the wheel is not of the form `dbfs:/`, but instead uses the FUSE mount in `/dbfs` to make the file appear local. For other libraries to install in the driver, you would specify them using standard conda conventions.\r\n\r\nTo install wheels on the workers, you would need to specify them in the cluster json, in a slightly different format than what you've been using:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"new_cluster\": {\r\n    \"spark_version\": \"6.5.x-scala2.11\",\r\n    \"num_workers\": 1,\r\n    \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"libraries\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"whl\": \"dbfs:/path_to_my_lib.whl\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo add other additional libraries you would use the [standard Databricks JSON format](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/libraries.html#managedlibrarieslibrary) for libraries in APIs.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit ugly to have to specify the libraries for workers and the driver separately in two different formats, but we could get a patch into MLflow in the next few days. To use it you'd have to wait until the next release (which may be up to a month from now) or build MLflow yourself from master (as described [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#prerequisites), except you could probably get away without installing the test requirements).\r\n\r\n**Approach 3.** In the long run we would like the workers to respect the conda environment too, but that would be a much longer project to get released and available to you, likely on the order of several months from now.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/629399933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3341996408,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM0MTk5NjQwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3341996408","actor":{"login":"Shmuma","id":66154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma","html_url":"https://github.com/Shmuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-15T18:00:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3341996411,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNDE5OTY0MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3341996411","actor":{"login":"Shmuma","id":66154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma","html_url":"https://github.com/Shmuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-15T18:00:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/629615643","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2800#issuecomment-629615643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2800","id":629615643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTYxNTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"Shmuma","id":66154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma","html_url":"https://github.com/Shmuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shmuma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-16T09:20:30Z","updated_at":"2020-05-16T09:20:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
