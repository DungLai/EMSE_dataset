FYI, we implemented something very similar in our forks. The main difference is we persist the list in the URL. It enables to share a view to an experiment by mail or instant messaging. You can prepare your board with only the columns you want then share the URL to your team mates.\r\n\r\nWe didn't push a PR to the main mlflow repo because this FR implies lot of changes and some refactoring on the JS part. Here a link to our changes in our fork: https://github.com/criteo-forks/mlflow/pull/199 https://github.com/criteo-forks/mlflow/pull/178\r\n\r\nThe main changes we did are:\r\n* States are stored at ExperimentPage level, and the columns are filtered in the Table. These arguments must be injected from Page to Component to Table. (and the dropdown with columns list must have also a callback to store the state)\r\n* The dropdown with columns list manages a \"exclude list\"... We changed it to an \"include list\"\r\n* It also implies to have the list of all available columns for an experiment. We added an endpoint for this.\r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to reuse our PRs. We will be happy to contribute.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/728765435/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jdlesage","id":658597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODU5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage","html_url":"https://github.com/jdlesage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
