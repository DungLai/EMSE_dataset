not just about ONNX, in fact, many issues were open in the mlflow github repo to allow predict to accept multidimensional arrays:\r\n\r\nOpen issues: \r\n* [[BUG] ONNX predict fails for high-dimensional models #3229](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3229)\r\n* [[BUG] Predict N-dimensional data with pyfunc from MLmodel #2830](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2830)\r\n* [[FR] Support tensor inputs to MLflow inference APIs #3159](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3159)\r\n\r\nPull requests:\r\n* [Added support for high dimensional onnx models #3307](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3307/)\r\n\r\nClosed issues:\r\n* [How to pass 2D array as an input to the MLFlow Model #1480](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1480)\r\n* [[FR]How to transfer the multi-dimensional pixel information of the image to the model after the model is deployed as docker？ #1668](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1668)\r\n* [[BUG] Model predict with json input fails if the dataframe has multi-index #2412](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2412)\r\n* [[FR] Mlflow serve - sending an image #2452](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2452)\r\n* [Recommended handling of I/O for pyfunc? #702](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/702)\r\n* [TensorFlow wrapper ravels outputs on predict #1066](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1066)\r\n\r\nThis is clearly something that blocks so many users from properly use their models logged by MLFlow, some work was done to allow onnx to accept multidimensional data in the pull request linked above trying to understand if the client wants to shape their DataFrame as a multi-dimensional array. I still don't understand why MLFlow predict method is tightly coupled to DataFrames which clearly can't represent a wide range of inputs, why don't we just allow passing numpy arrays ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/713490654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mohammedi-haroune","id":23096288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDk2Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23096288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune","html_url":"https://github.com/mohammedi-haroune","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammedi-haroune/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
