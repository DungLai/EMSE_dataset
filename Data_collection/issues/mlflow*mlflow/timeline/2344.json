Given that we don't have per-test pass-rate reporting yet, one way to get started here is to look through failed master builds [here](https://travis-ci.org/mlflow/mlflow/builds), identify unit tests that failed recently on master, and label them as flaky.\r\n* (~2 person-days) Investigate selective test execution via testmon to speed CI times. The challenge here seems like it'll be finding a way to ensure testmon's cache files (.testmondata) are updated when PRs are merged. We can look for inspiration at what other projects that use testmon (e.g. modin) do - it looks like modin for example (see [related PRs](https://github.com/modin-project/modin/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+testmon) & [umbrella issue](https://github.com/modin-project/modin/issues/853)) uses Github workflows to upload the .testmondata file to S3 on merges to master & fetches it at the start of PR builds.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd be interested in either of
