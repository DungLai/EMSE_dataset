like to understand the needs here a little bit better.\r\n\r\nAre these models that you want to use other functions of other supported model flavors? For example, are you logging something like `mlflow.sklearn.log_model` then loading via the pyfunc flavor and you want access to the methods of the underlying sklearn model (or other model flavor)?\r\n\r\nMy gap in understanding is that pyfunc sort of \"unifies\" the interface over many types of models -- i.e. it gives a consistent interface to load & score models, regardless of the underlying library/framework used. But if you want direct access to the internals, these are not necessarily the same across model flavors, so it makes me wonder whether the pyfunc flavor is what's desired.

entirely?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1248475972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"skylarbpayne","id":4830598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzA1OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4830598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne","html_url":"https://github.com/skylarbpayne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1248953420","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6794#issuecomment-1248953420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6794","id":1248953420,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85KcYRM","user":{"login":"ikrizanic","id":38288854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mjg4ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38288854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic","html_url":"https://github.com/ikrizanic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-16T06:04:57Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T06:04:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@skylarbpayne Hello, thank you for your interest in this FR.\r\n\r\nCustom models which I refer to when talking about unwrapping them could be (and often are) completely custom python classes which I use in inference pipelines.\r\n\r\nI understand your concern with pyfunc originally used for \"unifying\" and now using it just as a wrapper for any custom model, but this option is very useful in workflows where there is a need for storing custom python objects as pickled models. `mlflow.pyfunc` already implements save_model, log_model and load_model in the exact manner it is needed for most of the cases when using python objects, and I have no real need for creating custom flavors in that case.\r\nThat's why I still want to use pyfunc, while getting some more freedom in interacting with my objects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1248953420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ikrizanic","id":38288854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mjg4ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38288854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic","html_url":"https://github.com/ikrizanic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikrizanic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7400294115,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85R0zBDzwAAAAG5F4bj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7400294115","actor":{"login":"skylarbpayne","id":4830598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzA1OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4830598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne","html_url":"https://github.com/skylarbpayne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-16T06:04:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7400294119,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85R0zBDzwAAAAG5F4bn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7400294119","actor":{"login":"skylarbpayne","id":4830598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzA1OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4830598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne","html_url":"https://github.com/skylarbpayne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylarbpayne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-16T06:04:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7416427534,"node_id":"CE_lADOCB5Jx85R0zBDzwAAAAG6DbQO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7416427534","actor":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-19T19:30:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
