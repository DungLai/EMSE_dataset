As in the code sample above, it wasn't aware of the `tracking_uri` (I think) and therefore couldn't find experiments, even though the experiment methods (relying on the `client` object) did find it. This seems to be because experiment tracking and model registry are developed separately but unsure. it would be good if we could e.g. `mlflow.set_client` and use it as a default when relying on an `MlflowClient` object.\r\n\r\nShort version: Use both the client and mlflow.set_tracking_uri so both parts of mlflow are aware of the tracking_uri and use both start_run(experiment_id=... and mlflow.set_experiment so that both parts are aware.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/884787468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daimonie","id":10976353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc2MzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10976353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie","html_url":"https://github.com/daimonie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5054677012,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTA1NDY3NzAxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5054677012","actor":{"login":"daimonie","id":10976353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc2MzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10976353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie","html_url":"https://github.com/daimonie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daimonie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-22T09:50:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
