@oojo12, thank you for volunteering to implement this feature! Please feel free to get started on a pull request and let me know if you have additional questions.\r\n\r\n1. Using `FROM ubuntu:20.04` as a base image seems like a great idea.\r\n2. From the base image, we should `pip install` MLflow from a specified branch of the MLflow GitHub repository\r\n3. The CMD for starting the tracking server should be `mlflow server`, with additional arguments forwarded from the `docker run` invocation to the `mlflow server` command.\r\n4. Spot on!
