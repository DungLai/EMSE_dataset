This is what I'm thinking at the moment:\r\n\r\n* Update the `RunData` protobuf message to include minimum and maximum metric values, eg:\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage RunData {\r\n  // Run metrics (latest values).\r\n  repeated Metric metrics = 1;\r\n\r\n  // Run parameters.\r\n  repeated Param params = 2;\r\n\r\n  // Additional metadata key-value pairs.\r\n  repeated RunTag tags = 3;\r\n\r\n  // Run metrics (minimum values).\r\n  repeated Metric metric_minimums = 4;\r\n\r\n  // Run metrics (maximum values).\r\n  repeated Metric metric_maximums = 5;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Add a new column to the `latest_metrics` table to differentiate between latest, minimum and maximum values. The migration script for this should create the new column with a default value corresponding to latest and then populate the table with minimums and maximums from the existing data, similar to the migration used when the `latest_metrics` table was initially added. Possibly we could make this optional if users have a lot of data to migrate and don't mind only getting min/max values for new runs. It would also be nice to rename this table to something like `summary_metrics`, although that might be a bit more disruptive.\r\n* Update the minimum and maximum values in the DB when metrics are logged in the `SqlAlchemyStore`.\r\n* Add support for getting minimum and maximum metrics with the `FileStore`.\r\n* Update the UI to show minimums and maximums as well as latest values for single runs. Make sure this degrades nicely when using an older version store that doesn't provide min/max values.\r\n* As a follow up PR, look into updating the UI for listing runs to allow showing min/max values and sorting by these.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1068648950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adamreeve","id":626438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/626438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve","html_url":"https://github.com/adamreeve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6247459953,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx846egHnzwAAAAF0YKxx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6247459953","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T01:50:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6247459958,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx846egHnzwAAAAF0YKx2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6247459958","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T01:50:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6247459965,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx846egHnzwAAAAF0YKx9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6247459965","actor":{"login":"niksbansode","id":19736733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzM2NzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19736733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode","html_url":"https://github.com/niksbansode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niksbansode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T01:50:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6247459968,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx846egHnzwAAAAF0YKyA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6247459968","actor":{"login":"niksbansode","id":19736733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzM2NzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19736733?v=4","gravatar_

@dannyfriar @niksbansode @adamreeve. Apologies for the delayed response. I think we can leverage the existing GetMetricHistory API (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#get-metric-history) to implement this feature in the UI. This will require the frontend to scan the values of each metric and determine the min / max, but it should be much easier to implement than extending the `Metric` or `RunData` API, which is a major hurdle considering the number of organizations that implement their own MLflow Tracking services.\r\n\r\nWe'd be happy to review a pull request that implements this capability on the Runs page, as shown in the awesome mock provided by @niksbansode.

@dbczumar, computing the min and max on the UI side seems reasonable for the single run view, but showing the min/max values in the experiment view for multiple runs and potentially being able to sort and search based on the min/max values seems more useful, eg. to allow easily comparing runs, and that would probably require server side support.\r\n\r\nI would think it should be possible to do this in a backwards compatible way, so that if a tracking API doesn't provide the min and max values then the UI just won't show them and won't allow sorting/searching by them (or maybe only show them in

be great if there was a plan for how this can be supported in the experiment view too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1069699063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adamreeve","id":626438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/626438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve","html_url":"https://github.com/adamreeve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreeve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6254367535,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx846egHnzwAAAAF0yhMv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6254367535","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T22:27:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6254367543,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx846egHnzwAAAAF0yhM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6254367543","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T22:27:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1071324100","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4750#issuecomment-1071324100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4750","id":1071324100,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx84_2xvE","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-17T19:59:47Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T19:59:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Absolutely, I agree that comparing and sorting runs based on min / max metric values would be quite helpful. I think it would be great to take incremental steps toward a solution, beginning with UIs for display min / max metric values for a single run. The next step we could take would be to display this information on the Compare Run page. After those, we can then work together to determine whether we want to update additional UIs (e.g. the runs table on the experiment page) or introduce expanded search support (e.g. including MIN / MAX clauses in the filter / order by strings).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1071324100/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1146976600","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4750#issuecomment-1146976600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4750","id":1146976600,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85EXXlY","user":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-06T02:40:44Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T02:40:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#5574 implemented this feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1146976600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
