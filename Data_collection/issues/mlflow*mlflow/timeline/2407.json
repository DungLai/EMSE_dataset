faced the same problem using the Java API and QuickStartDriver Example. The solution to this specific use case is simple, but not well documented.  In a **local setup**, you first need to install mlflow python package and run the server.  \r\n```python\r\npip install mlflow\r\nmlflow serve # your server is runing by default on http://localhost:5000 \r\n```\r\nNow, you can create your client instance and launch your experiment  \r\n```java\r\nString MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI = \"http://localhost:5000 \r\nMlflowClient client = new MlflowClient(MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI ) \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be more practical if we had a maven plugin to automatically launch the server without the Python setup.
