Therefore I would need a few information regarding the design-decisions:\r\n\r\nCurrently the stages are hard-coded in two places: The `entities/model_registry/model_version_stages.py` and the `server/js/src/model-registry/constants.js`. The goal of a PR would be to enable additional stages but also enable the renaming of existing stages to align them with users internal naming convention. Therefore I would see `Archived` and `None` as fixed meta-stages which are not editable, while `Staging` and `Production` would simply be the default configuration in the future.\r\n\r\nConcrete design questions I have are:\r\n * How should the stages be configurable. The common approach would be some configuration file, how ever I think there is no such concept in MLFlow yet, is there? An alternative would be command-line arguments, but the information that could be given with those is rather limited (see below colors). Therefore my suggestion would be the introduction of a yaml- or json style configuration which users could point to at startup using a command line flag.\r\n * Colors: Currently Production is reflected with green for production and yellow for staging. For consistency-reasons I would keep those and enable users to change those and the colors of other stages using the configuration file.\r\n \r\n An example of the config-file and how it would look like by default (to keep mlflow as it is) would be:\r\n     \r\n    {\r\n        \"model_stages\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\":  \"Staging\",\r\n                \"color\": \"#ff961d\"}\r\n            ],\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\":  \"Production\",\r\n                \"color\": \"#2e7d32\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nUsers could then modify this default configuration, for example to add a stage \"Dev\" prior existing stages they could do the following. \r\n     \r\n    {\r\n        \"model_stages\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\":  \"Dev\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\":  \"Staging\",\r\n                \"color\": \"#ff961d\"}\r\n            ],\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\":  \"Production\",\r\n                \"color\": \"#2e7d32\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nThe color of the Dev  stages would be the default grey, as users did not specify any color.\r\n\r\nIn a similar fashion additional stages could also be placed between staging and production (for example preprod or integration as they are often named) or even behind prod.\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible to remove or rename existing stages. How ever the documentation should state, that renaming and removals of stages are not advised on existing installations, as there would not be any automatic migration. \r\n\r\nThis PR does not need any rest-api changes as the changes be handled with the existing API. It hopefully also won't require additional dependencies. It would change the UI with regard that all configured stages would be visible in the models view as well as the dropdown for deployment within a model-versions-page.\r\n\r\nI am open to feedback and eager to hear your opinions on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1091152731/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"krlng","id":1107509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc1MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng","html_url":"https://github.com/krlng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1092712970","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3686#issuecomment-1092712970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3686","id":1092712970,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85BIXoK","user":{"login":"marcindulak","id":3178318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzgzMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3178318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak","html_url":"https://github.com/marcindulak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcindulak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-08T10:24:12Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T10:24:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Do
