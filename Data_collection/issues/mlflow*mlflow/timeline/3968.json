Thanks for filing this issue. This is not really a bug. Rather, it's a documentation error. \r\n\r\n> If a registered model with the name doesn’t exist, the method registers a new model, creates Version 1, and returns a ModelVersion MLflow object. If a registered model with the name exists already, the method creates a new model version and returns the version object.\r\n\r\nThis comment refers to the section below and for the code snippet for `mlflow.register_model()` rather than `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`, which can take registered_name as keyword argument; the [signature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.log_model) does not return anything. It will\r\ncreate a version when registering but it does not return it. Only the `mlflow.register_model()` returns a ModelVersion. \r\n\r\nThe comment as is can be misleading to suggest the model version is returned from `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()` when it's not. I'll correct that. Hence, this is not a bug in the signature, only document ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThe comment should read as:\r\n\r\n> If a registered model in the above code with the name doesn’t exist, the method registers a new model, creates Version 1. If a registered model with the name exists already, the method creates a new model version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/760398569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4207697140,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIwNzY5NzE0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4207697140","actor":{"login":"deokkyun","id":19466114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDY2MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19466114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun","html_url":"https://github.com/deokkyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-14T18:51:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4207697147,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMDc2OTcxNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4207697147","actor":{"login":"deokkyun","id":19466114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDY2MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19466114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun","html_url":"https://github.com/deokkyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deokkyun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-14T18:51:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4207705167,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0MjA3NzA1MTY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4207705167","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-14T18:53:50Z","assignee":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https:
