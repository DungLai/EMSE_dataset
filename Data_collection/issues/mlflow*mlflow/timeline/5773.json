The state dict is downloaded to a temporary location on the filesystem that is not clearly exposed by this method. To download the state dict artifact to your local filesystem and obtain the resulting path, I recommend using the `mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts` API (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.artifacts.html#mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts), which is available in MLflow >= 1.25.0. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npretrained_state_dict_path = mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts(pretrained_url)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for using
