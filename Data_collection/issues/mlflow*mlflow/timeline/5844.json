Others have already done basic auth with nginx around mlflow. If you use s3 as the artifact store and don't proxy artifacts through the tracking server, they upload there and at the same time that bucket name (i.e. username) and token are the credentials. The same auth is used for nginx and the bucket name can also be team name and db schema name. Then the wrapper or decorator in would either reinitialize the db and async wait to point to the right place before querying. Or it could reinit the whole flask app/server if easier with the new info.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't get to the ui yet. But I assume a similar approach could be taken. Also the ui can be a bit less finicky because it can run anywhere on demand and doesn't need to be up or accessible 24/7. Others have put it inside of jupyterhub. It could even just be run locally.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's all worth the work though. Separate team instances and auth are already easy to achieve. We just have to suck it up and handle the inefficiency of running hundreds of uis and tracking servers when one with multitenancy would do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1176984291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nreith","id":6225521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjU1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6225521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith","html_url":"https://github.com/nreith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreith/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1236297296","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5844#issuecomment-1236297296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5844","id":1236297296,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85JsGZQ","user":{"login":"umialpha","id":13465150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDY1MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13465150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha","html_url":"https://github.com/umialpha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umialpha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-04T09:27:15Z","updated_at":"2022-09-04T09:27:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"our
