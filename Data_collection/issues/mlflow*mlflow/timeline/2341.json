are three primary ways  [Model Registry API workflows](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#api-workflow) work with the model registry. None is a default one, and its usage and choice will depend on at what point in your experiment runs you will want to create or register a model. \r\n\r\nInstead of advising or showing all examples to register the model while using `mlflow.<model_flavor>.log_modelI(..)`, we should rather suggest the three ways you can register a model. \r\n\r\nThis way developers can choose at what point during his or her experiments are they ready to commit the model to the registry and start collaborating with the rest. \r\n\r\nIf we update all the MLflow examples to register the model while logging the model, then we are dictating or setting the best practice, which may not always be the case. The workflows or usage I envision among developers is as follows:\r\n\r\n**Scenario 1:** I know exactly which model I want to register as version 1, do it while running experiments, and let it create multiple versions, and I'll choose the best version later to transition to \"Stage\"\r\n- create a model, log all metrics, and register as part of `mlflow.<model_flavor>.log_model(...)`\r\n\r\n**Scenario 2**: Not sure which run within an experiment yields the best outcome, so don't register it during runs,\r\n-  create a model, log all metrics\r\n- examine all runs to evaluate the best run\r\n- now register the model using the _runs://URI_\r\n\r\n**Scenario 3:** Let me create a registered model with a unique name and no versions\r\n- run experiments \r\n- chose the best run to create a version.\r\n\r\nAll these [three ways to interact with the registry are documented](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#api-workflow)\r\n\r\nSo IMHO, in general, we should not always register the model at the time we log the model in our\r\nexamples because it may suggest what we think that scheme is the best. Plus, each run will result in a version of the model, which can grow with hundreds of runs.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, what's best will depend on each use case how the ML team experiments, and at what point feel they want to commit to the registry for collaborating, testing, staging, productioinizing, archiving or deleting. \r\n\r\nPerhaps, for this particular example, you can say you can register a model while logging the model with the `register_model_name=<name>` as part of the `mlflow.<model_flavor>.log_model(...)`, but there are other ways too, and point them to the docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/595524144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/596173885","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2341#issuecomment-596173885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2341","id":596173885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjE3Mzg4NQ==","user":{"login":"netanel246","id":12097973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk3OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12097973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246","html_url":"https://github.com/netanel246","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netanel246/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T07:01:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T07:01:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dmatrix,
