I am aware of the parameter concept, sorry for being a little vague here. Let's actually take an example from the examples repo (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/multistep_workflow/als.py). There are various parameters passed via @click.option to the train function that parameterize each run (and are actually quite essential to the run). This is a pretty common setup. However, the parameters given via cmd are not logged in the example. To do this you would have to log them by hand:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.log_params({\r\n\"split_prop\": split_prop,\r\n\"max_iter\": max_iter,\r\n# ...\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, with the proposed `log_vars` function, you simply write:\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.log_vars()\r\n```\r\nAnd now, if you added, let's say an important `ALS` parameter to your command line arguments, it will be automatically logged with `log_vars` while otherwise you will have to remember to add it to your logging statement.\r\n\r\nYes, logging those parameters is doable without the proposed function, but the proposed function will ease the development process of such scripts tremendously and prevent missing parameters when logging runs. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the proposed function _can_ be considered syntactic sugar. Maybe I am a little biased by `sacred` which basically logs everything for you automatically ;) Two different paradigms, I guess. \r\n\r\nI hope this makes a little more sense now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/520695747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgbckr","id":1241516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1241516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr","html_url":"https://github.com/mgbckr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgbckr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/520920380","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1724#issuecomment-520920380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1724","id":520920380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDkyMDM4MA==","user":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-13T17:02:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T17:02:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"One alternative that I typically use is I use `argparse` to take in command line arguments and use `log_batch` to log that.

thanks for the PR! I wonder if the use case in your example could be satisfied by running your Python script as an MLflow project. In particular, MLflow actually supports running Python scripts as projects & passing parameters to them on the command line, logging said parameters. For example, you can run a Python script via `mlflow run /parent/directory/of/script -e script_file.py --no-conda -P firstparam=3 -P secondparam=4`, which under the hood will run `python /parent/directory/of/script/script_file.py --firstparam 3 --secondparam 4` - perhaps we could look into enhancing this functionality (or the docs, since it doesn't seem to be mentioned [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#running-projects) if it currently falls

So it seems the project module kind of alleviates the need to log parameters in the first place. Meaning, that for logging parameters when using the project functionality, `mlflow` would prefer the user not to log parameters by hand at all. Assuming that this is true, I think there are two possible cases:\r\n\r\n**Case 1**: Parameter logging should be handled by the project module only. In this case, `mlflow.log_param` and `mlflow.log_params` should not exist, since all parameters should be handled through project functionality, i.e., calling an entry point. Looking at the multi-stage example project ([example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/977186ce49304e5a19b4fb101af5f518ed0c2a43/examples/multistep_workflow/als.py)), this seems to be the case since no parameters are explicitly logged. This would mean that the tracking module is not an independent project. \r\n\r\n**Case 2**: The tracking module is independent, thus supporting the use of a custom project structure without having to use the Mlflow project functionality. The whole `fluent` API (`start_run`, `log_param`) etc. points towards this use case.   \r\n\r\nSo, considering the `fluent` API, I think, Case 2 is the more likely. In this case my proposed `log_vars` function makes sense (i.e., for Case 2) in order to support convenient logging independent of the project module. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think :)\r\n\r\n*As a side-note*: I think having a side-by-side comparison of a tracking / `fluent`-based script and a project based setup  (discussing pros and cons) would be a really valuable asset for the documentation.\r\n\r\n*One more note*: I find the [example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/977186ce49304e5a19b4fb101af5f518ed0c2a43/examples/multistep_workflow/als.py) mentioned above a little confusing. Using `click` may result in unexpected behavior since it implies that the script can also be called *without* the `mlflow` project functionality. However, doing this will implicitly triggers `mlflow` logging to a local directory which may be unexpected (without using the mlflow cmd or API this can not be prevented). It may be more elegant to disable logging completely, if an entry point is not called via the MLflow cmd / if no run is explicitly started.
