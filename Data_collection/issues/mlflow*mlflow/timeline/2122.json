proposed a PR that fixes the problem when a new SQL migration is introduced. But if someone introduced an API changes or new requirements to mlflow, these tests will be broken again.\r\n\r\nI am not sure to understand why we need to specify mlflow as dependency of a mlflow project (in `MLProject` file) that will be run by `mlflow run`. It just makes sense that a mlflow project needs mlflow.\r\nWhat about to let the `mlflow run`  command to manage the version of mlflow that will be used ? I suggest to introduce a `--install-mlflow` option to the CLI (exactly the same as the `mlflow models serve --install-mlflow` option). It will enable these tests to be executed using the current mlflow version instead the latest from pypi.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/557552891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jdlesage","id":658597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODU5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage","html_url":"https://github.com/jdlesage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2835145663,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4MzUxNDU2NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2835145663","actor":{"login":"jdlesage","id":658597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODU5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage","html_url":"https://github.com/jdlesage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdlesage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"58e33b5ceaaaa2ad3e63053c101b5a3042665d2d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/criteo-forks/mlflow/commits/58e33b5ceaaaa2ad3e63053c101b5a3042665d2d","created_at":"2019-11-27T10:39:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/565469519","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2122#issuecomment-565469519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2122","id":565469519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTQ2OTUxOQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T14:52:59Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T14:52:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
