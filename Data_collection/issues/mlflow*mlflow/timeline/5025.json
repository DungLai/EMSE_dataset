I wasn't sure if you were cautious in filtering out specific routes to avoid having a high-cardinality label, which is a concern that I have if we have an open-ended path label included in the metric. Generally a good rule of thumb for Prometheus metrics is to keep the cardinality for any given label less than 10. Whereas there are currently 47 endpoints and that number can potentially grow.\r\n\r\nI also have concern with maintainability if we keep an explicit list of paths to filter, as its likely that as new endpoints are added to the server people won't know to also update a list in `mlflow/server/prometheus_exporter.py`. \r\n\r\nThe simplest approach, in my opinion, towards getting better operational visibility would be to remove the path label from the metric and instead have request counts/latencies grouped by HTTP verb and HTTP status (and we can choose to explicitly _exclude_ some endpoints like the health endpoint if we'd like).
