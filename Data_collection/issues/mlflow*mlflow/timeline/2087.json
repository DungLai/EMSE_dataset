I haven't worked on it, that'd be awesome! Before writing code & opening a PR, a good first step would be to write up a description of the proposed API & its behavior. Happy to review a proposal if you're able to write one & share it here.\r\n\r\nI'm new to Pytorch, but I'd recommend focusing on adding autologging for the most common Pytorch APIs first (will spend some time tomorrow learning more about Pytorch). Also, I'd suggest `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()` as the API name, to match the existing Keras & TF autologging APIs, but open to alternatives. Thanks for being willing to contribute

sorry for the delayed response, that'd be awesome - one strawman API proposal would be to add an `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()` API, and an `mlflow.fastai.autolog()` if appropriate - AFAICT fastai & PyTorch are analogous to Keras and TensorFlow (fastai seems to be a higher-level API implemented using PyTorch), so seems reasonable to have separate APIs for the two libraries. \r\n\r\nThat being said, it's probably worth considering whether implementing PyTorch autologging could indirectly solve fastai autologging (i.e. could we reuse the implementation of PyTorch autologging for fastai autologging?). My guess is that it might be possible, but the right way to implement fastai autologging would be instead be to use public `fastai` APIs, e.g. by adding callbacks to save & log the user's model as you described - I don't know too much about either PyTorch or fastai so curious to hear your opinion.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/577028229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2968831711,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk2ODgzMTcxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2968831711","actor":{"login":"antoniomdk","id":4209122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDkxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4209122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk","html_url":"https://github.com/antoniomdk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-22T06:25:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2968831721,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5Njg4MzE3MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2968831721","actor":{"login":"antoniomdk","id":4209122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDkxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4209122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk","html_url":"https://github.com/antoniomdk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-22T06:25:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/577099469","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2087#issuecomment-577099469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2087","id":577099469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzA5OTQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"antoniomdk","id":4209122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDkxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4209122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk","html_url":"https://github.com/antoniomdk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoniomdk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-22T09:50:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T09:51:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes,
