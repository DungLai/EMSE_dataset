Agreed that it's somewhat confusing to have the same public API exposed in two modules, one way to address the issue would be to make the APIs in `mlflow.tracking` private and expose only `mlflow.log_param` etc (though this would be a pretty substantial breaking change).  @mateiz do you have any thoughts on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/412163565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1783089253,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc4MzA4OTI1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783089253","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T18:14:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1783089254,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3ODMwODkyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783089254","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T18:14:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1783089255,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc4MzA4OTI1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783089255","actor":{"login":"amesar","id":1721873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1721873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar","html_url":"https://github.com/amesar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T18:14:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1783089256,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3ODMwODkyNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783089256","actor":{"login":"amesar","id":1721873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1721873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ames
