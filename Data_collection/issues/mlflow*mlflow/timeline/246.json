Obviously as we get larger runs with larger sets of metrics and parameters, we may want to revisit this, but at that point we should also refactor `get_run` not to be some potential landmine API that could explode the client. Maybe @mateiz has some opinion on the place of those three additional APIs.\r\n\r\n`search` I agree without reservation that it should be added in the current Python API -- but this is the most complicated API, and maybe, as you pointed out [here](https://github.com/amesar/mlflow-python-client/blob/master/mlflow_client/mlflow_api_client.py), we should simplify it before exposing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415129785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1803367024,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgwMzM2NzAyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1803367024","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-22T18:19:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1803367026,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MDMzNjcwMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1803367026","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-22T18:19:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/426613976","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/246#issuecomment-426613976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/246","id":426613976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjYxMzk3Ng==","user":{"login":"parkerzf","id":1273326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1273326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf","html_url":"https://github.com/parkerzf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parkerzf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-03T12:11:31Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T12:11:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any
