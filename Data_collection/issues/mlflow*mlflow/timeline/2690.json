ended up getting the same issue when I deleted all my experiments. The workaround I did was delete the empty mlruns folder. Then, I launched mlflow ui which re-created the mlruns folder with the default experiment 0. After that I was able to create new experiments again in my notebook.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/705162042/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JustinCharbonneau","id":25487881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDg3ODgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25487881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau","html_url":"https://github.com/JustinCharbonneau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinCharbonneau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/753719676","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2690#issuecomment-753719676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2690","id":753719676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzcxOTY3Ng==","user":{"login":"RicardoSouzaMoura","id":4068157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjgxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4068157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura","html_url":"https://github.com/RicardoSouzaMoura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RicardoSouzaMoura/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-04T02:03:07Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T02:08:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I could solve this problem by creating a new experiment\r\n`mlflow experiments create -n Default`\r\nAfter that, I went to the mlruns folder and changed the folder name from 1 to 0.
