workaround.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/586260490/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MarkusShepherd","id":4608491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDg0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4608491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkusShepherd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusShepherd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3243436301,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNDM0MzYzMDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3243436301","actor":{"login":"relferreira","id":4078815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzg4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4078815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/relferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/relferreira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-17T08:47:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3504534454,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MDQ1MzQ0NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3504534454","actor":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T22:56:08Z","label":{"name":"area/docker","color":"ede978"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3504534764,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzNTA0NTM0NzY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3504534764","actor":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T22:56:17Z","assignee":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avata

@dbczumar , thanks for the reply.\r\nThe solution proposed in #2189 is sufficient in its idea, but I believe the implementation lacks two things:\r\n1. Add support for supplying a base image in the CLI of SageMaker (to be able to use the direct build/push functionality through mlflow.sagemaker)\r\n2. When supplying your own docker base image with custom properties/private dependencies, you'd sometimes want to include it in the relevant virtualenv/conda env that the model will be working in. In the proposed solution, a new venv is created through miniconda regardless of the custom image, which will just make the base virtualenv redundant, or if we trry to create one before on the same path that mlflow does, will fail since the directory already exists.\r\nI believe adding support for the base virtualenv would work, of course.\r\n\r\nSpecifying our own templates would work as well, of course, but that means that we are not \"aligned\" if there are any changes to the mlflow docker template. Not ideal, but could work as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1107776679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zionsofer","id":61654681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjU0Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61654681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer","html_url":"https://github.com/zionsofer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zionsofer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6485461972,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx84eYwMdzwAAAAGCkEvU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6485461972","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-24T07:10:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6485461975,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx84eYwMdzwAAAAGCkEvX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6485461975","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-24T07:10:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
