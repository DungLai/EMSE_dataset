We (Databricks) did some investigation on our end on the possibility of improving searchRuns(). We concluded with an approach on dynamic pagination of searchRun results, instead of providing another interface such as searchRunLite.\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding, in your use case, you'd like the backend to still return both RunInfo and RunData, but for RunData, exclude params and metrics field, and only include the tags field. Is it correct?\r\n\r\nOne issue with the above approach is the future proofness: someone might want to show some params on UI one day. A customized API might not accommodate that well. If you have ideas on a flexible searchRunLite() API design that can select the fields one wants without too much complexity, and how a backend can take advantage of such request, please let us know!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/973909769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jinzhang21","id":78067366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDY3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78067366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21","html_url":"https://github.com/jinzhang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
