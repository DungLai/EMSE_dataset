haha :P - yeah I think an example demonstrating how to display & query MLflow experiment data with redash would make a lot of sense. Looks like redash supports JSON-over-HTTP as a datasource ([see docs](https://redash.io/help/data-sources/querying/json-api)). Thus it could be worth looking into building a redash dashboard backed by the [MLflow SearchRuns REST API](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#search-runs) - if you or someone else is interested in investigating, we'd be happy to provide guidance & could document the solution publicly on
