It can be solved with two steps:\r\n\r\n1) Using the `docker run` flag propagataion introduced https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2608 by passing:\r\n ```\r\nmlflow run ... -A net=host\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes the the error thrown by `mlflow.start_run`. But then we get the error:\r\n```\r\nFile \"/mlflow/projects/code/validator/mlflow_handler.py\", line 52, in _log_artifacts\r\n    mlflow.log_artifact(config_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\", line 311, in log_artifact\r\n    MlflowClient().log_artifact(run_id, local_path, artifact_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 257, in log_artifact\r\n    self._tracking_client.log_artifact(run_id, local_path, artifact_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 257, in log_artifact\r\n    artifact_repo.log_artifact(local_path, artifact_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlflow/store/artifact/s3_artifact_repo.py\", line 38, in log_artifact\r\n    s3_client.upload_file(local_file, bucket, dest_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/boto3/s3/inject.py\", line 131, in upload_file\r\n    extra_args=ExtraArgs, callback=Callback)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/boto3/s3/transfer.py\", line 279, in upload_file\r\n    future.result()\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/futures.py\", line 106, in result\r\n    return self._coordinator.result()\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/futures.py\", line 265, in result\r\n    raise self._exception\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/tasks.py\", line 126, in __call__\r\n    return self._execute_main(kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/tasks.py\", line 150, in _execute_main\r\n    return_value = self._main(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/s3transfer/upload.py\", line 692, in _main\r\n    client.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key, Body=body, **extra_args)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/client.py\", line 316, in _api_call\r\n    return self._make_api_call(operation_name, kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/client.py\", line 613, in _make_api_call\r\n    operation_model, request_dict, request_context)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/client.py\", line 632, in _make_request\r\n    return self._endpoint.make_request(operation_model, request_dict)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/endpoint.py\", line 102, in make_request\r\n    return self._send_request(request_dict, operation_model)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/endpoint.py\", line 132, in _send_request\r\n    request = self.create_request(request_dict, operation_model)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/endpoint.py\", line 116, in create_request\r\n    operation_name=operation_model.name)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/hooks.py\", line 356, in emit\r\n    return self._emitter.emit(aliased_event_name, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/hooks.py\", line 228, in emit\r\n    return self._emit(event_name, kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/hooks.py\", line 211, in _emit\r\n    response = handler(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/signers.py\", line 90, in handler\r\n    return self.sign(operation_name, request)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/signers.py\", line 160, in sign\r\n    auth.add_auth(request)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/auth.py\", line 357, in add_auth\r\n    raise NoCredentialsError\r\nbotocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/71922462cc82225f5509d0baea71d523d169d73e/mlflow/projects/__init__.py#L831 doesn't place the aws credentials where they can be used. \r\n\r\n2) Workaround if docker container user is root is to add: \r\n```\r\ndocker_env:\r\n    volumes: [..., 'home/user/.aws:/root/.aws']\r\n```\r\nin the MLproject file.\r\n\r\n@tomasatdatabricks, @dbczumar Shouldn't https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/71922462cc82225f5509d0baea71d523d169d73e/mlflow/projects/__init__.py#L831 be modified? For some reason it only works for me when docker container is run as root. Any thoughts as to why? These two steps have been the only way I've gotten a docker project to log to a remote tracking server.\r\n\r\nLet me know,
