I think it's also alright if this behavior is S3 specific, we can extend support to other artifact stores (at least the ones that support a notion of content type) in the future.\r\n\r\nOne question for you though is whether we could handle this on the UI-side itself (and if not, why not) - we currently to [guess the content type](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/18eacdd9bde4e693942ff94882fb3da322b593c0/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/artifact-view-components/ShowArtifactPage.js#L27-L36) of the file in the UI based on the file extension, and this seems to work for other artifact stores (e.g. DBFS).
