This is a feature. Isolation between processes is a good thing. \r\nIf you're looking for a free tip on implementing something that will work for your use case, try generating a run_id from within your for loop and pass that run_id to your notebook. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    \r\n    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http:://127.0.0.1:5000\")\r\n    experiment_id = mlflow.create_experiment(name=\"My Cool Experiment\",\r\n                                             tags={\"mlflow.note.content\": \"An experiment I'm going to use\"})\r\n    run = mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=experiment_id, run_name=\"A run I'm going to reuse\")\r\n    \r\n    for i in range(3):\r\n        pm.execute_notebook(\r\n            \"model_train.ipynb\",\r\n            \"/dev/null\",\r\n            parameters = {\"i\": 3, \"run_id\": run.info.run_id}\r\n        )\r\n    mlflow.end_run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, from within your notebook, simply parse that ```**kwargs``` value and consume the passed-in run_id. You _may_ need to set the tracking server address at the top of the notebook as well just to be certain. \r\n\r\nAnother tip: you really shouldn't delete the default experiment. It will only create headaches for you. You can recreate it (and it will be auto-recreated for you if you do delete it in the upcoming 2.0 release).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1306163065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7756175184,"node_id":"CE_lADOCB5Jx85VqxLIzwAAAAHOTddQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7756175184","actor":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-07T20:42:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
