Maybe we need to temporarily unset some env variables set by the parent process like `$MLFLOW_HOME` (e.g. as set in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/dev/install-common-deps.sh#L52).\r\n* Fix `mlflow:::python_mlflow_bin()` to look in `Scripts/` subfolder for the binary and see all tests passing (hopefully).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/708580435/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lorenzwalthert","id":10477073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10477073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzwalthert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/709017590","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3206#issuecomment-709017590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3206","id":709017590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwOTAxNzU5MA==","user":{"login":"lorenzwalthert","id":10477073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10477073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzwalthert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-15T09:03:32Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T14:29:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a major bug IMO and makes it unusable for R users on windows, so I think we must look into this asap. @smurching @javierluraschi @harupy @yitao-li @dmatrix . \r\n\r\nContext: The localisation of the executable (the reason this issue was opened) is fundamentally the same as #3319, #1009 and the timeout (described below) the same as #3393 and #3077.\r\n\r\nIt's apparently more complicated than what I outlined in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3206#issuecomment-708580435. First, there are no windows tests for R, so we can't show (and later test) the problematic behavior. In addition, setting the executable right does not solve the problem, because `mlflow_client()` will still time out as reported in #3393 and #3077. I have the suspicion that the problem occurs within `mlflow:::mlflow_client()` with the file path that has two `:` on Windows, e.g. `\"file://D:/a/mlflow-test-3206/mlflow-test-3206/mlruns\"` as shown [here](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/mlflow-test-3206/runs/1257884865?check_suite_focus=true#step:9:28).  \r\n\r\nI think to properly solve this, one needs access to a Windows machine which I currently don't have and I also don't have time to look into this. \r\n\r\n**Edit:** I believe there is a missing `/` in the R output that Python has.

You can find some more experimentation I did here: https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/mlflow-test-3206/commits/main. In particular, I got \r\n```\r\nError in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : \r\n  Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 5816: Connection refused\r\nCalls: <Anonymous> ... request_fetch -> request_fetch.write_memory -> <Anonymous>\r\nExecution halted\r\n```\r\nwith `mlflow:::mlflow_validate_server(client)`  with https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/mlflow/pull/5, which should return the correct number of trailing slashes as described in the PR description, but still does not work. But probably it's easier if you start debuging again from scratch 🤔. I hope you have an interactive windows env available, this is very annoying to debug otherwise -.- Also, I don't know what the latest version of ML flow is that worked on windows for R - if any.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/738026226/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lorenzwalthert","id":10477073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10477073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzwalthert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4067778362,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA2Nzc3ODM2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4067778362","actor":{"login":"yitao-li","id":405346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTM0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/405346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li","html_url":"https://github.com/yitao-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-03T14:25:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4067778368,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwNjc3NzgzNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4067778368","actor":{"login":"yitao-li","id":405346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTM0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/405346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li","html_url":"https://github.com/yitao-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitao-li/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-03T14:25:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/738029340","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3206#issuecomment-738029340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3206","id":738029340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODAyOTM0MA==","user":{"login":"lorenzwalthert","id":10477073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10477073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzwalthert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-03T14:29:57Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T14:29:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":
