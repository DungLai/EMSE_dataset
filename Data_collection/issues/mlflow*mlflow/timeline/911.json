[epoch count].OneOf(jpg, png, gif, txt, csv...)`\r\n\r\nMost bigdata systems use leading zeros to keep files sorted. In your case, renaming sample files like so would help\r\n\r\n```\r\nsample-00001.jpg\r\nsample-00002.jpg\r\n...\r\nsample-00011.jpg\r\nsample-00012.jpg\r\n...\r\nsample-00111.jpg\r\nsample-00112.jpg\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to do that in your

this is hard, because every time I save a sample I would have calculate the amount of leading zeros.

Since it works in vscode, maybe it would be possible to just adapt their sorting-algorithm?
