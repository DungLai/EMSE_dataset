If that is the case, it may cause confusing if having multiple timezone office.\r\n\r\nDate is stored as epoch from UTC, so it's really more related to how we display it in the frontend, which is based on your browser's time zone.\r\n\r\n> For user, any plan to allowing provided as an parameter?\r\n\r\nIt would definitely be reasonable to support overriding users. Currently we just find it by asking the OS for the current user's name. How were you thinking a user might specify their name, though -- on the command line? Through an environment variable?\r\n\r\n> For storage, seems like it use local file as storage. Any roadmap/ plan to use database as storage media?\r\n\r\nDefinitely we want to extend it beyond local files as storage, but there's no concrete work towards that yet. For the time being, having the files on a network-attached storage with automatic backups (e.g., AWS EBS) is hopefully a good solution with respect to reliability.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/396094191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1672839373,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY3MjgzOTM3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1672839373","actor":{"login":"makcedward","id":36614806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjE0ODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36614806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward","html_url":"https://github.com/makcedward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-11T00:26:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1672839374,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NzI4MzkzNzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1672839374","actor":{"login":"makcedward","id":36614806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjE0ODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36614806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward","html_url":"https://github.com/makcedward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-11T00:26:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/396116638","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/30#issuecomment-396116638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/30","id":396116638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjExNjYzOA==","user":{"login":"makcedward","id":36614806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjE0ODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36614806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward","html_url":"https://github.com/makcedward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makcedward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-11T04:03:24Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T04:47:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For
