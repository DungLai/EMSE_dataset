@WeichenXu123 \r\n\r\n(to answer 1.) As mentioned above,  The goal is adding a `before_request` hook to perform authorization.\r\nIn details, the mlflow server deployment consists of a AWS application load balancer performing authentication and forwarding the authenticated user to the mlflow server running as a Fargate service. To keep the architecture simple, it would be nice not having to add middleware (between the ALB and the MLflow server container) to perform user authorization to the server. Therefore it would be convenient to add a custom hook checking the JWT authenication header provided by the ALB.\r\n\r\n(to answer 2.) Your proposal seems sound however I wouldn't like to be blocked by/coupled to a plugin interface MLflow defines on top of Flask's one. One reason would be to take advantage of shared Flask middleware components (for auth, logging, etc.) without having to instantiate new MLflow server plugin classes. \r\n\r\nMy proposal was somewhat more generic as it would have allowed one to have full access and customization capabilities to the `mlflow.server.app` instance before spinning up the gunicorn WSGI. This approach of \"customizing\" the Flask app before spinning up the server is already taken into use in the MLflow's Prometheus exporter
