\r\n\r\nI'm very interested in this issue! We want to deploy tens/hundreds of models using mlflow build-docker, and the image size is clearly a blocker!\r\n\r\nIn general, I have 2 comments:\r\n1. The docker image already provides a decent form of virtualization. Creating another conda environment inside it can be redundant.  \r\n2. I would imagine an even more customized feature (please point me to an issue if created before), which allows a user to reference his pre-written Docker template file to create the model image. Currently there are some dependencies hard-coded [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/models/docker_utils.py#L14). I see the PR #2496  split it into 2 for Java and Python separately, but that still looks a little rigid to
