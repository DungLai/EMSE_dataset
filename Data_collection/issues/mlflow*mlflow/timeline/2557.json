about this some more, some more off-the-cuff thoughts:\r\n* Tracking & model registry: given that we want to drop the gunicorn & SQLalchemy dependencies, seems reasonable for the client to contain only RestStore implementations of the tracking & model registry AbstractStores (with ``mlflow-client``, you can log to a remote server). We could add FileStore support later if there's a compelling use case.\r\n* Projects: The client should be capable of running projects. Long term, we may want to enable running projects via the REST API, in which case we can remove some dependencies needed to run projects from the client (e.g. gitpython). We don't need to include `docker`, `kubernetes` as dependencies\r\n* Flavors: Client should support autologging, `save_model`, `log_model`, `load_model` APIs for flavors, as well as the ``mlflow.pyfunc`` APIs for scoring models on pandas and Spark DataFrames. Note that schema enforcement requires `pandas`.\r\n* Models: The [FlavorBackend interface](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/HEAD/mlflow/models/flavor_backend.py#L4), defining the methods underlying the `mlflow models serve/predict/build-docker` CLIs, should not be part of the client, as it requires a `gunicorn` dependency\r\n* Model deployment APIs could be part of the client, as they don't add additional dependencies (users are responsible for installing boto, azureml, etc)\r\n* CLI: tricky to split. We actually rely on the CLI to log artifacts from the Java and R clients, and `mlflow.projects.run(..., synchronous=False)` invokes `mlflow run` in a subprocess (also currently depends on the CLI). These CLI dependencies aren't fundamental, but would take quite a bit of work to remove (would require reimplementing available Python artifact repos in Java/R etc). Another extreme is to include the full CLI, where some commands (e.g. ``mlflow server``) would just fail if you don't have the appropriate dependencies installed\r\n\r\nI think reasonable next steps on this would be to:\r\n* Investigate what other packages do - is it reasonable to include APIs where users are required to install dependencies in order to use those APIs (as we currently do flavors, e.g. ``mlflow.tensorflow`` APIs), or would this lead to too much user confusion / should the ``mlflow-client`` package not contain such APIs?\r\n* Write out the long-term packaging structure we'd like MLflow to have (an `mlflow-client` package that `mlflow` depends on, splitting out additional packages from `mlflow` as appropriate, where all of the packages are co-versioned and released together?)\r\n* Investigate options (given what Python packaging supports) to define the `mlflow-client` package. Ideally, we can keep the ``mlflow-client`` code within the main MLflow repo for ease of development\r\n\r\nOther goals:\r\n* Only require dependencies for functionality that actually needs it (\"graceful degradation\"), e.g. don't import `pandas` where not needed\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/663709261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1144337938","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2557#issuecomment-1144337938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2557","id":1144337938,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85ENTYS","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-02T02:01:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T02:01:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"[mlflow-skinny](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow-skinny/)
