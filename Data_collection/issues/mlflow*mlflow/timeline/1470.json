In the future, you can get around this issue by specifying the conda_env parameter in log_model to configure the environment file saved with the serialized model (in this case by specifying the public pyspark=2.4.3 instead of pyspark=2.4.3dev0).\r\n\r\nHowever, looking deeper the azureml.build_image command currently only supports the \"python\" deployment framework in Azure ML - we'll get that fixed so that you get native pyspark support in AzureML. Your best bet right now might be to use mlflow all the way up to the build image command, where you then switch to using Azure ML SDK APIs directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/504290763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"akshaya-a","id":16749003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ5MDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16749003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a","html_url":"https://github.com/akshaya-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaya-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2429267744,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQyOTI2Nzc0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2429267744","actor":{"login":"joshuafennessy","id":7947679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7947679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuafennessy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-21T05:06:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2429267745,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MjkyNjc3NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2429267745","actor":{"login":"joshuafennessy","id":7947679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7947679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuafennessy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuafennessy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-21T05:06:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2429267747,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQyOTI2Nzc0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2429267747","actor":{"login":"rastala","id":18446796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDQ2Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18446796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala","html_url":"https://github.com/rastala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rastala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-21T05:06:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2429267749,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MjkyNjc3NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues
