@sunishsheth2009, I'm looking to try and implement this FR and was wondering about some points.\r\n\r\nRight now, most of the state related to what is shown in the experiment view is stored in two separate objects [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/sdk/MlflowLocalStorageMessages.js) (ExperimentPagePersistedState & ExperimentViewPersistedState). Is there a good reason for them to be separate like this? I feel they are similar enough to be in the same object and handled the same way across the ExperimentPage and ExperimentView components. That would make exporting the state to a url simpler as well.\r\n\r\nSome of the state is already being pushed to the query parameters in the url (such as search string and column to sort on). What are your thoughts on pushing all the other state changes (`categorizedUncheckedKeys`, `runsExpanded`, `showMultiColumns` etc.) to the url query params? If all the state is pushed to the query params, the share button would simply copy the url to the user clipboard. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime I'll work on a bit of a prototype and share my thoughts\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/940798975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marijncv","id":9256667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTY2Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9256667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv","html_url":"https://github.com/marijncv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijncv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5447950653,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx847iZG8zwAAAAFEuSE9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5447950653","actor":{"login":"sunishsheth2009","id":5621432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjE0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5621432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009","html_url":"https://github.com/sunishsheth2009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-12T08:45:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5447950660,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx847iZG8zwAAAAFEuSFE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5447950660","actor":{"login":"sunishsheth2009","id":5621432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjE0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5621432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009","html_url":"https://github.com/sunishsheth2009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-12T08:45:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/941651185","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4820#issuecomment-941651185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4820","id":941651185,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx844IHTx","user":{"login":"sunishsheth2009","id":5621432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjE0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5621432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009","html_url":"https://github.com/sunishsheth2009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunishsheth2009/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-12T22:18:2

I feel, ExperimentPage would maintain state for experiments page and same for experiment view. We can lift the state up when we need the state to be shared across multiple components. I don't think that is the case here. Each component maintaining its own persistent state does sound good. \r\n\r\nI do agree adding things to the URL does make it easier to share the URL. We can surely do that. But, we need to consider what all is important to be shared. Example, sharing if the runs are expanded or what columns are expanded/order of columns might not be super useful. So can we list the things that we feel are important that could be part of the URL and necessary for sharing?

I created a [draft PR](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4904) with a prototype for this FR. It adds the share button that copies the current url to the users clipboard and displays a small notification message. Also, the prototype maintains the following state in the url:\r\n\r\n- `search`\r\n- `startTime`\r\n- `orderByKey`\r\n- `orderByAsc`\r\n- `categorizedUncheckedKeys`\r\n\r\nThe other state elements that could be included with the share button are:\r\n- `runsHiddenByExpander`\r\n- `runsExpanded`\r\n- `showMultiColumns`\r\n- `unbaggedMetrics`\r\n- `unbaggedParams`\r\n\r\nI think adding the the `showMultiColumns` to the share button makes sense, but not sure about the others. What do you think?\r\n\r\nFinally, I ended up lifting the state of `categorizedUncheckedKeys` from the ExperimentView to the ExperimentPage to make the state setting from the url done in one place.
