I am also facing the same issue with a model using PyTorch Geometric, which takes two tensors for the inputs. One tensor represents the **nodes** in the graph and another represents the **edges**. This works for batch inference, but not for online serving. My format is the same as above in the code to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n       \"inputs\":{\r\n             \"nodes\": tensor(num_nodes, num_features),\r\n             \"edge_index\": tensor(num_edges, 2)\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt would be extremely helpful if MLflow would accept different lengths for tensor inputs.
