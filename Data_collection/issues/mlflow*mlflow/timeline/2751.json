Zangr, I’m really proposing two separate ideas.\r\n\r\n-  right now it requires a lot of API calls and manual work to get data in the format I describe and provide a hand-made example of above, which is the standard for most data scientists / statisticians, insofar as people are aware that there’s a standard ;) (i.e. see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data). So this is equally applicable to anyone that uses DataFrames in Python (pandas or xarray), R, or Julia. ggplot2, plotnine, seaborn, holoviews, Altair, Plots.jl, VegaLite, and dozens of Grammar of Graphics plotting libraries use this standard.\r\n\r\n- plotly is great, but it uses plotting templates. To customize GUI, I either have to give you JS code that you eval, or fork Mlflow to inject my own plots. I proposed a method for users to supply JSON to add custom plots in the GUI. This JSON could easily be stored in the database or artifact backends. Plotly is great for developers, but VegaLite is great for end users.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Happy to elaborate if something isn’t clear.
