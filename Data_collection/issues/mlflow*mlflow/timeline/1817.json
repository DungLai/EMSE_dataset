it - thanks for the clarification. \r\n\r\n@dnzprmksz, for your use case, it sounds like having the equivalent of the `mlflow.spark.log_model` in java would be sufficient? (`save_model` saves to the local filesystem and `log_model` allows saving to remote/cloud ones)\r\n\r\n@salqadri, for yours, if you are using MLflow tracking, you may be able to use https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/java_api/org/mlflow/tracking/MlflowClient.html#downloadArtifacts-java.lang.String- ? or if you need to version your models, using model registry (by registering models into it from python) and downloading on the java/scala side with https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/java/client/src/main/java/org/mlflow/tracking/MlflowClient.java#L751 might work.
