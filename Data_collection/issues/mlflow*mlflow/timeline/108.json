A few questions about it:\r\n- Are there any additional messages beyond \"worker timeout\"? Maybe on stderr or stdout?\r\n- Do you have a `mlruns` directory in the location where you ran `mlflow ui`? If so, are any runs created using an older version of MLflow? (This isn't expected to be a problem but would be good to know.)\r\n- What exact path is MLflow installed in? Try doing `which mlflow`, and also make sure it's the one that came from `pip3` and not some other installation.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, you don't need `npm` to run `mlflow ui`; we only use it for building the client-side JavaScript files needed for MLflow, but we don't use it as a server. It should just require that one Python process on port 5000 + child processes to serve requests, but it seems that those are crashing for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/401980830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/402029728","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108#issuecomment-402029728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108","id":402029728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjAyOTcyOA==","user":{"login":"dennyglee","id":1446829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee","html_url":"https://github.com/dennyglee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T06:41:27Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T06:59:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Out of curiosity, by any chance will `http://localhost:5000`work even though `http://127.0.0.1:5000` will not?

Also, I am running these with virtualenv environments in both macOS and Ubuntu.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/402420817/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stenpiren","id":26466563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDY2NTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26466563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren","html_url":"https://github.com/stenpiren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stenpiren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1715879321,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTcxNTg3OTMyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1715879321","actor":{"login":"dennyglee","id":1446829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee","html_url":"https://github.com/dennyglee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-04T09:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1715879323,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3MTU4NzkzMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1715879323","actor":{"login":"dennyglee","id":1446829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee","html_url":"https://github.com/dennyglee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-04T09:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/402493184","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108#issuecomment-402493184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108","id":402493184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjQ5MzE4NA==","user":{"login":"dennyglee","id":1446829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee","html_url":"https://github.com/dennyglee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennyglee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-04T14:20:57Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T14:20:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @stenpiren -

Python searches the module by sys.path and the current directory is the first path it searches. The mlflow project directory structure has `mlflow/mlflow/server` in it.

Just do `pip install mlflow --user` as a requirement instead.\r\n\r\nThank you for this amazing package.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/410524808/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mycaule","id":6161385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjEzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6161385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule","html_url":"https://github.com/mycaule","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycaule/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/410707512","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108#issuecomment-410707512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/108","id":410707512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDcwNzUxMg==","user":{"login":"thunterdb","id":7594753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTQ3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7594753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb","html_url":"https://github.com/thunterdb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T13:27:50Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T13:27:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@stenpiren I had the same problem, which was due to the fact that the web files (js, css) were not built.
