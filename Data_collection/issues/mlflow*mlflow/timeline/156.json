Could I ask what pip version you're using? Looking at the output of your installation, I can access the URLs that get printed (e.g. https://pypi.python.org/simple/querystring_parser/). I suspect the certificate verification failures are what's ultimately preventing the installation - are you able to `pip install` other packages hosted on PyPi? If the problem is certificate verification, the fixes suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29751768) might work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/405340653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1735973091,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTczNTk3MzA5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1735973091","actor":{"login":"15021687693","id":41133129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTMzMTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41133129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693","html_url":"https://github.com/15021687693","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-16T18:41:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1735973094,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3MzU5NzMwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1735973094","actor":{"login":"15021687693","id":41133129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTMzMTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41133129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693","html_url":"https://github.com/15021687693","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-16T18:41:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/405435246","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/156#issuecomment-405435246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/156","id":405435246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTQzNTI0Ng==","user":{"login":"15021687693","id":41133129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTMzMTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41133129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693","html_url":"https://github.com/15021687693","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/15021687693/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-17T02:01:12Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T02:01:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**#
