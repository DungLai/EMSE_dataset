This is actually not about transitioning the same model version between stages (e.g. moving model version 3 from Production to Staging), rather it is concerned with moving back to a previous model version _within a given stage_.\r\nFor instance, model version 3 was in Production previously and it was working fine. After a while, you decide to move model version 7 into production. However, you find out that there is a bug in this new version (version 7) and you want to move back to a version that you know was working properly (version 3). \r\nWhen you have a large number of versions registered, it is difficult to keep in mind which model version to go back to (if you are making direct transitions, say by using the `transition_model_version_stage` API). This is why I think this feature might be useful.\r\nWe could also maybe provide several options along with this, such as moving back to the first model version in a stage or rollback n times and so on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1173908706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MinuraPunchihewa","id":49385643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzg1NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49385643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa","html_url":"https://github.com/MinuraPunchihewa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6928709478,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85M_O-vzwAAAAGc-7dm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6928709478","actor":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-04T14:53:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6928709482,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85M_O-vzwAAAAGc-7dq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6928709482","actor":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-04T14:53:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1174490035","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6180#issuecomment-1174490035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6180","id":1174490035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85GAUuz","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-05T01:06:16Z","upda

though).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1174706327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MinuraPunchihewa","id":49385643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzg1NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49385643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa","html_url":"https://github.com/MinuraPunchihewa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MinuraPunchihewa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6931927425,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85M_O-vzwAAAAGdLNGB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6931927425","actor":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-05T07:18:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6931927433,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85M_O-vzwAAAAGdLNGJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6931927433","actor":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-05T07:18:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1174770170","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6180#issuecomment-1174770170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6180","id":1174770170,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85GBZH6","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-05T08:27:4
