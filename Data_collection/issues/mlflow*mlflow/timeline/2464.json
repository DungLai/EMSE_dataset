thanks for filing - the same question actually came up in #1924, where the resolution was that adding an `artifact_location` parameter to `set_experiment` makes the API hard to reason about, as you're not guaranteed that the artifact location will actually be set on the newly-created experiment (the `artifact_location` will be honored if the experiment doesn't already exist with a different artifact location). \r\n\r\nIt is possible to achieve a slightly simpler implementation of your use case (a few less lines of code, but still pretty gnarly):\r\n\r\n```\r\nexisting_exp = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(name)\r\nif not existing_exp:\r\n  mlflow.create_experiment(name, artifact_location=\"...\")\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm now leaning towards actually supporting `artifact_location` as a parameter to `set_experiment`, as it seems the current APIs do cause a good bit of pain from a usability standpoint. I think if we do this, we should make sure it's clear to the user when `artifact_location` is not honored because an experiment already exists with a different `artifact_location` (& hopefully that case is rare), e.g. log a warning in that case. Let me ask around for other opinions, but if others agree we'd be happy to review a contribution adding an `artifact_location` parameter :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/657369015/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3538041935,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUzODA0MTkzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3538041935","actor":{"login":"Minyus","id":33908456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTA4NDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33908456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus","html_url":"https://github.com/Minyus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T05:36:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3538041937,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MzgwNDE5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3538041937","actor":{"login":"Minyus","id":33908456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTA4NDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33908456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus","html_url":"https://github.com/Minyus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T05:36:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3538097306,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MzgwOTczMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3538097306","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T06:03:52Z","label":{"name":"priority/important-soon","color":"534cb5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/657398245","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2464#issuecomment-657398245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2464","id":657398245,"nod
