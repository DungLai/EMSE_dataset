Note that you can specify the default artifact URI to use for experiments created under an MLflow server via the `--default-artifact-root` argument to `mlflow server`, e.g. by running your server via a command like `mlflow server --default-artifact-root s3://your-s3-bucket`. Given that the default artifact URI can be specified in this manner, would you be able to clarify why your workflow involves passing an artifact URI explicitly to `create_experiment`? It seems you could avoid the need for this by setting the default artifact URI when you run the server.\r\n\r\nThanks

- Thanks for replying. Yes, I can do that. But in case you are working on multiple projects - each having its own artifact location - as different s3 buckets and different locations on s3 - this approach would not work.

Note that you can specify the default artifact URI to use for experiments created under an MLflow server via the `--default-artifact-root` argument to `mlflow server`, e.g. by running your server via a command like `mlflow server --default-artifact-root s3://your-s3-bucket`. Given that the default artifact URI can be specified in this manner, would you be able to clarify why your workflow involves passing an artifact URI explicitly to `create_experiment`? It seems you could avoid the need for this by setting the default artifact URI when you run the server.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks again!\r\n\r\nIt seems that does not work if the path is a local path. I am building a POC with `docker-compose` and both the client and server will write to their path in their own container but it is the same local folder on the host machine. \r\nJust so i dont have to set up S3 connection and permission etc... for a POC.
