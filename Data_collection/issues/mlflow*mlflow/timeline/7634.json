Thanks for reporthing this. We checked GitHub Actions logs generated during Dec 25 ~ Dec 30, but didn't find `torchtoriton`. I investigated why and found https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/91539. My hypothesis is that `torchtoriton` is an optional dependency and `pip install --upgrade --pre torch -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html` doesn't install it (but `pip install --upgrade --pre torch[dynamo] -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html` does).
