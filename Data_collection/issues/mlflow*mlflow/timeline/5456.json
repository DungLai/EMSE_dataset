I strongly support some kind of pipeline execution native to MLflow. I think that would make it a much more complete platform for MLops. For some background on my questions, I'm a ML engineer with 3.5 years experience focused in deep learning computer vision. Some of my favorite tools are [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning), MLflow 😄, [Raytune](https://www.ray.io/ray-tune), [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt), and [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra). To start, I have a couple generic questions\r\n\r\n1. To me, MLX sounds similar to Kubeflow, so I'm curious how you would distinguish between the two, and what would convince a team to switch from Kubeflow given that it's already fairly mature in comparison? An obvious difference is that Kubeflow is native to Kubernetes for its execution engine / orchestration framework vs. MLX sounds like it would be more agnostic in that sense, but I'm curious about other considerations \r\n2. Related to the above, how will infrastructure be provisioned/deployed with MLX? Considering cloud, on-prem, containerization, distributed workloads, existing orchestration frameworks, GPUs, etc\r\n\r\nReading your proposal, I'd be interested in exploring flexibility for user-defined\r\n\r\n1. **Pipeline templates:** having some pre-made starting points is good, but I think many users will quickly find themselves needing to customize aspects beyond what can be accomplished with a config file. If there wasn't an option to subclass/extend the base templates, I worry that MLX wouldn't be used widely enough to gain traction in the community\r\n3. **Execution engines:** I see you mentioned Bazel above, which might be okay for an initial release. However, could the pipeline engine interface to MLX be designed so that it's adaptable for other framework integrations in the future? I've heard Airflow, Pachyderm, and other tools mentioned more often in the MLops community than Bazel, and it would be great to write integrations for future (unknown) tools as they come out since the landscape is evolving so rapidly\r\n\r\nI'd also like to give a shout-out to the [MLops.community](https://mlops.community/) Slack workspace (I have no affiliation, just a community member who thinks it's awesome). Currently there are over 8.7k members in there discussing best practices for MLops under a wide variety of use cases. I've shared this issue in their `#mlops-questions-answered` channel to promote further engagement, but I think the broader chat history could also be useful for MLflow contributors who want to read-up on additional opinions for brainstorming\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1060941210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"addisonklinke","id":39926682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTI2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39926682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke","html_url":"https://github.com/addisonklinke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonklinke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1060988430","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5456#issuecomment-1060988430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5456","id":1060988430,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx84_PWYO","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T18:19:36Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T18:19:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@addisonklinke MLX and Kubeflow serve different personas. The initial target for MLX is data scientists who are new to ML under production settings, which we believe are the majority.\r\n\r\nIMHO Kubeflow is designed for engineers/ops. Take t[he MNIST example from kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/blob/master/mnist/mnist_vanilla_k8s.ipynb). The very first code cell would scare away many data scientists. \r\n\r\nMLX proposes a two-layer solution:\r\n\r\n1. ML pipeline templates defined by engineers, which provide main skeletons to solve certain kinds of problems with guardrails during development and deployments. This could include a deployer to Kubeflow.\r\n2. Problem-specific conf/code defined by data scientists (mostly within their comfort zone), to customize the project to fit concrete problems.\r\n\r\nIn the current proposal, we host a few pipeline templates in MLflow directly. I hope it would cover many ML problems already. But as you mentioned, it won't help solve all problems. For advanced problems, later we can open up pipeline/step APIs for engineers to create/extend/customize pipeline templates for data scientists to use.\r\n\r\nInitially, the pipeline engine choice is an implementation detail. After we validate the main idea of MLX has a good product fit, future development can make pipelines compile down to different pipeline execution engines.\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing this proposal with MLops.community!

There could be support for kubernetes out of the box, but then the user could write a custom runner to run experiments on whatever infrastructure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1061069296/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"giacomov","id":5917371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTczNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5917371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov","html_url":"https://github.com/giacomov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giacomov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6222587745,"node_id":"PE_lADOCB5Jx85FJVDozwAAAAFy5Sdh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6222587745","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"pinned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-11T06:02:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1069196243","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5456#issuecomment-1069196243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5456","id":1069196243,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx84_uqPT","user":{"login":"zbloss","id":7165947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjU5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7165947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss","html_url":"https://github.com/zbloss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbloss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-16T14:33:55Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T14:33:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I like this direction, but would really want to see MLflow utilize or integrate with existing pipeline tools like Argo Workflows or Apache Airflow.

One layer is the pre-defined pipeline templates created by engineers, similar to \"compile -> test -> package -> publish\" workflow in software development.
