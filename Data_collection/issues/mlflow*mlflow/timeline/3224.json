When loading, check if file exists; if not fallback to looking for file with h5 prefix (to maintain backwards compat)\r\n\r\nThis way, backwards compat can be maintained (though with a slight perf hit for model loading -- I don't believe it's a critical perf difference though).\r\n\r\nThen later when you want to make it a breaking change (e.g. next time you do a significant version update), we can remove the fallback.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nEDIT: It looks like someone has taken a stab at [fixing this bug](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3282); I think it still needs some work, but looks
