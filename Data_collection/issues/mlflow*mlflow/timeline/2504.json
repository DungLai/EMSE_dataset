I don't think we have plans to implement a Python health check function in MLflow, since the health check API is only implemented by the open source MLflow server (other implementations of the REST API do not expose the `/health` endpoint). If we were to introduce such a function in Python, we would also likely have to introduce it for R and Java, expanding the API surface significantly.\r\n\r\nInstead, we propose fetching the tracking server URL via `mlflow.get_tracking_uri()` and using a Python HTTP library (e.g., `requests`) to query the `/health` endpoint of an OSS MLflow tracking server. For now, I'm going to close this ticket; please feel free to reopen this if the proposed workaround does not meet your requirements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/622601956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3294698590,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI5NDY5ODU5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3294698590","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T22:57:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3294698593,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI5NDY5ODU5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3294698593","actor":{"login":"mjmikulski","id":23487805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDg3ODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23487805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski","html_url":"https://github.com/mjmikulski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T22:57:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3294698595,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyOTQ2OTg1OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3294698595","actor":{"login":"mjmikulski","id":23487805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDg3ODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23487805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski","html_url":"https://github.com/mjmikulski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjmikulski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T22:57:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
