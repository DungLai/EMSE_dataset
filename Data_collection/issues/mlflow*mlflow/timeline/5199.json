it turns out, there's a bug in `mlflow_rest` here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/tracking-rest.R#L68\r\n\r\nThe issue is that that ^ line is converting boolean values to characters, so `TRUE` is converted to `\"TRUE\"`, which then fails. An easy (albeit hacky, since it still leaves us open to more bugs) fix, would be to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nPOST = function(){\r\n  httr::POST( api_url,\r\n        body = if (is.null(data)) NULL else rapply(data, function(.x) ifelse(!is.logical(.x), as.character(.x), .x), how = \"replace\"),\r\n        encode = \"json\",\r\n        mlflow_rest_timeout(),\r\n        config = rest_config$config,\r\n        req_headers\r\n  )\r\n},\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere we first check the data type of the thing we're trying to convert to a character before converting, just to make sure we don't coerce a boolean to a string. _However_, this brings up another question: Why are we coercing these types anyways? As far as I can tell, the following also works:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nPOST = function(){\r\n  httr::POST( api_url,\r\n        body = if (is.null(data)) NULL else data,\r\n        encode = \"json\",\r\n        mlflow_rest_timeout(),\r\n        config = rest_config$config,\r\n        req_headers\r\n  )\r\n},\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nso maybe it makes sense to just get rid of the type coercion? Why is this type coercion here in the first place? Any pointers on this front would be great.\r\n\r\nSeparately, I'm happy to PR fixes for these issues. If I do, what is the best way to test any changes I make? I see we have some test infrastructure set up in `testthat/`, and I see there's already a test for this function here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/R/mlflow/tests/testthat/test-model-registry.R#L294-L313, but I'm not sure how this test is passing, given that (unless I'm missing something big), it's pretty broken.\r\n\r\nThanks for any pointers on this, and let me know if I can help out!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1000976910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mrkaye97","id":44219491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjE5NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44219491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97","html_url":"https://github.com/mrkaye97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1001045817","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5199#issuecomment-1001045817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5199","id":1001045817,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx847qr85","user":{"login":"mrkaye97","id":44219491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjE5NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44219491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97","html_url":"https://github.com/mrkaye97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-25T17:07:31Z","updated_at":"2021-12-25T17:07:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One other comment on this before I forget: It's concerning to me that I can get a `500` for what boils down to a bad parameter data type.

I think the stage transition test mocks the `mlflow_rest` function which is why making a change at that deep of a level doesn't actually change the behavior of the test.  You can propose a change to mlflow by making a fork of mlflow, and creating a PR that adds the changes you are proposing to correct the behavior you are observing and have the CI run all of the unit tests.  At that point, you can have someone who is more knowledgable in R read through the changes and advise on next steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1218917524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriscon-db","id":84737625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzM3NjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84737625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db","html_url":"https://github.com/kriscon-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriscon-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1219687283","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5199#issuecomment-1219687283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5199","id":1219687283,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85IsvNz","user":{"login":"mrkaye97","id":44219491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjE5NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44219491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97","html_url":"https://github.com/mrkaye97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkaye97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-18T16:18:34Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T16:18:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">  saw that it broke some other tests (mlflow_log_batch specifically)\r\n\r\nAha okay, that makes sense!
