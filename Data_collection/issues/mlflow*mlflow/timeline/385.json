We request users of these stores to kindly add those to your dependencies.\r\n\r\nSome of these dependencies are added to test-requirements. But what we dont have is an integration test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/416822206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/418677075","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/385#issuecomment-418677075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/385","id":418677075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODY3NzA3NQ==","user":{"login":"jakeret","id":11830719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODMwNzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11830719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret","html_url":"https://github.com/jakeret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakeret/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-05T10:12:25Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T10:12:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for not responding earlier. \r\nWould it be an option to have these optional dependencies defined as [`extras_require`](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies) in the `setup.py`?
