Thinking more about this. I see two issues here:\r\n\r\n1. an object of type `pandas.Series` will raise an error when passed as a parameter. I believe that expected behavior should be that a `pandas.Series` is rendered as a list. Note that an `np.array` of shape `(n, )` is rendered as a list.\r\n2. The server handles errors poorly causing the behavior that @wmeints saw. When an API call results in an error that server hangs on that error. I believe that expected behavior should be that the server handles and logs the error, but then returns to a ready state.
