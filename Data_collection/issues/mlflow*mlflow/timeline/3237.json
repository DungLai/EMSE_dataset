indeed, we already use artifacts to store plots with confidence intervals. However, this is not good enough. The most important part of the feature request is to be able to compare across runs. Being able to compare artifacts across runs would also be an interesting feature to have. But using artifacts to compare metrics would not be very optimal. It is important to observe metrics on the same y-axis to easily judge if and how much intervals overlap for different runs. Doing this with artifacts would require you to create horizontally narrow plots with a single metric without any labels or tics. And then the comparison of artifacts would need to guarantee that all compared artifacts are perfectly aligned horizontally.\r\n\r\nI know this is not a small feature which may not be implemented due to its size or lack of interest from more people. Though I do consider it important and wanted to throw out the idea to see what happens.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/670355694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mauvilsa","id":5780272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODAyNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5780272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa","html_url":"https://github.com/mauvilsa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauvilsa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3631960955,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYzMTk2MDk1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3631960955","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T06:42:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3631960957,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MzE5NjA5NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3631960957","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T06:42:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3632029941,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM2MzIwMjk5NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3632029941","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T07:07:00Z","label":{"name":"area/tracking","color":"48eabc"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
