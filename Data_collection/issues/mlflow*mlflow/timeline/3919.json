If `loggedModels.filter` returns an empty array, `loggedModel` would become `undefined`.\r\n\r\n\r\n`registeredModelSource` represents a model URI and `model['artifact_path']` represents the `artifact_path` field in an `MLmodel` file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nThis explains why the error was resolved when @1pyroaqua removed `/` at the end of `source` (https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3919#issuecomment-751908285).\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(registeredModelSource)\r\n// \".../<runId>/artifacts/model/\"  (note '/' at the end)\r\n\r\nconst artifactPath = registeredModelSource.split(`${runId}/artifacts/`)[1];\r\nconsole.log(artifactPath)\r\n//  -> model/  (note '/' at the end)\r\n\r\nconsole.log(loggedModels)\r\n// -> [{artifact_path: \"model\", ...}]\r\n\r\nloggedModels.filter((model) => model['artifact_path'].includes(artifactPath));\r\n// returns an empty array because \"model\".includes(\"model/\") evaluates to false.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@sylus I guess something similar (= mismatch between registered model source and artifact_path value) is happening in your failing experiment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/752112581/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4156284967,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE1NjI4NDk2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4156284967","actor":{"login":"vas610","id":64650227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjUwMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64650227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610","html_url":"https://github.com/vas610","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-30T05:03:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4156284969,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNTYyODQ5Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4156284969","actor":{"login":"vas610","id":64650227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjUwMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64650227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610","html_url":"https://github.com/vas610","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vas610/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-30T05:03:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4156294990,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE1NjI5NDk5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4156294990","actor":{"login":"sylus","id":984304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NDMwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/984304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus","html_url":"https://github.com/sylus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-30T05:12:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4156294991,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNTYyOTQ5OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4156294991","actor":{"login":"sylus","id":984304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NDMwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/984304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylus","html_url":"https://github.com/syl
