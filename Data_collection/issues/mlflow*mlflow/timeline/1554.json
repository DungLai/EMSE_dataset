And after I looked at the loss vs step graph and found the step with the lowest loss, I will now want to of course get the checkpoint I saved for that step, since that corresponds to my best model I now might want to deploy.  \r\n\r\nIt's possible I have some huge misunderstanding here somewhere, so let me try to make my thinking even more explicit:\r\n\r\nI am training a ResNet for an image classification task on a custom dataset. Just like Andrew Ng would want I have chose my single number evaluation metric. Now, after every epoch of training I will evaluate my current model on a validation set, log the metrics and if the evaluation metric I care about is the best I have seen so far, I will want to save my model (which as I understand in MLflow would mean logging a checkpoint of the model as an artifact). Of course as I progress with training most likely there will be multiple epochs where the evaluation metric is the best I have seen so far (after the first epoch this will be my best model for sure, hopefully after the second epoch it will be even better), so I will end up with multiple checkpoints logged as I train for many epochs. \r\nNow at the end of the training I would like to find the checkpoint where my single evaluation metric did best and deploy that model to production. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty standard use-case to me (is it not? is logging all the best models a bad idea? how else would I do it?) and it is still not clear to me how MLflow supports this (since there seems no way to connect the checkpoints (artifacts) I logged to the value of the metric at a given step. Am I missing something? Should I not be saving my model checkpoints as artifacts? Is there another way to connect my model checkpoints with the metrics I am logging with MLflow).\r\n\r\nThanks already for your patience in going through this. :)  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/511994340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"timonbimon","id":14793026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzkzMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14793026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon","html_url":"https://github.com/timonbimon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/511996356","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1554#issuecomment-511996356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1554","id":511996356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTk5NjM1Ng==","user":{"login":"apurva-koti","id":51172624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTcyNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51172624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti","html_url":"https://github.com/apurva-koti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurva-koti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T21:33:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T17:35:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I think the misunderstanding here is that a 'step' is not a snapshot of your entire training session at a given point of time.

I guess my point from the very beginning was that we seem to give up a lot of flexibility by only relating artifacts to *runs* and not to specific snapshots of training.\r\n\r\nDon't you agree that it makes much more sense to ask the question: \"How well does this model do on my validation set?\" and \"What is the best model I trained?\" rather than to ask \"How does the learning curve of the training run this model was trained with look like?\" and \"What was the best run I had?\". By just associating a model with a run we enable people to answer the second type of question. To answer the first I need to associate a model with a specific metric and using the step when the metric and model were logged seem a natural way to do this.\r\n\r\nI am sorry if all this sounds a lot like complaining to you, but it's really just meant as a suggestion for improvement.

run.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/512234927/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"timonbimon","id":14793026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzkzMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14793026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon","html_url":"https://github.com/timonbimon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timonbimon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2489263496,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ4OTI2MzQ5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2489263496","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-17T12:35:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2489263499,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0ODkyNjM0OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2489263499","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-17T12:35:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/512506575","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1554#issuecomment-512506575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1554","id":512506575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjUwNjU3NQ==","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T18:08:27Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T18:08:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@timonbimon
