also experienced this issue, with a similar setup:\r\n- OS Platform and Distribution: Arch Linux\r\n- MLflow installed from: official pip \\ pypi\r\n- MLflow version: 1.17.0\r\n- MLflow backend store:MySQL 8.0.25 locally hosted via docker\r\n- MLflow artifact root: local file system\r\n- Python version: 3.9.5\r\n\r\nI noticed that I only got a Deadlock error in `store.log_metric()` if the given metric key for a run_id is not yet in the latest_metrics table (so the first log of a new metric). \r\n\r\nI did some digging and was able to consistently reproduce this error:\r\n1. Run MySQL via: `sudo docker run --name=mysql-mlflow -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mlflow -e MYSQL_USER=mlflow -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysecretpasswd -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretrootpasswd -d -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0.25`\r\n2.

However, if none of the rows adheres to the filter condition (run_uuid, metric.key), the row-level lock will be set on a non-existent row. This can have some strange behaviours as mentioned in these references:\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17068686/how-do-i-lock-on-an-innodb-row-that-doesnt-exist-yet\r\n- https://fastmail.blog/advanced/mysql-lock-nonexistent-row/\r\n- https://mysqlquicksand.wordpress.com/2019/12/20/select-for-update-on-non-existent-rows/\r\n\r\nIn our case, instead of performing row-locking, both FOR UPDATE statements probably lock the whole table and are both allowed to do so, creating a deadlock.
