It needs ACL manipulation to enable the other members of his team to contribute to his experiments. And, one may argue it is not a good practice to allow other people to write to the user personal folder.\r\n* There are often people that don't belong to the team that want to contribute to an experiment. For example, we encourage sort of 'kaggle challenges' internally. In this case, there are no common groups between the team and the contributor.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is to allow users to store artifacts in their own hdfs folder.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what do you think about overriding the artifacts uri at run creation (ie add an argument in https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#create-run) ? The uri set in experiment will become a default uri. As far I understand, in the data model, each run has already its own artifact uri.

Your proposal changes the data model and would need some thinking if it affects different clients and backends and backend store implementations. This is complicated since MLflow supports plugins and developers and users of MLflow APIs could have their custom backends using abstract class interfaces. You can follow [`#mlflow-plugins` slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/mlflow-users/shared_invite/enQtMzkxMTAwNTcyODM5LTkzMDFhNzliNjExOGQ1ZGI1ZmFlMGE5YWE1OTI4ZGM1ZWZmYzc3NGNiZTM3YjgwOTdlODAzMjJhZTdiN2Y3MWY)\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that a single experiment was designed to be a collection of runs that is accessible to anyone who has access to the experiment data.
