Hey @WeichenXu123\r\n> \r\n> > Do you mean policy such as LRU ?\r\n> \r\n> Yeah, I think LRU would be suitable at least for my use case of multiple models, each being used one after the other.\r\n> \r\n> > One issue is, how to check how much memory the model uses ? And once exceeding memory threshold, we can evict the model from cache.\r\n> \r\n> I think a simple upper limit on the number of models would be adequate, at least for me. (For my use case in fact, the limit could be 1.)\r\n\r\nHi @JohnFirth, apologies for the delay here. I think a configurable LRU cache would be great here, and we would be very excited about reviewing a PR with this feature, if you're still interested in contributing one. Please let me know if you have any questions.
