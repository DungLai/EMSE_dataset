dbczumar. Thanks for your reply :)\r\n\r\nActually we have the requirement in which we have a model which is already trained and we need to deploy the model using mlflow. That model's prediction column is set as \"predictionCol\" instead of the default name \"prediction\". Now when we pass some sample data using curl command command to see the prediction, we are getting the error. \r\n\r\nI can see in mlflow/spark.py file, inside predict() method of class __PyFuncModelWrapper, we are selecting the \"prediction\" column from the transformed dataframe.\r\nInstead of hard-coding \"prediction\" column, can we just update the code to take the prediction column for the model type using getPredictionCol().","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/558970997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rashmeetmalik","id":54629045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik","html_url":"https://github.com/rashmeetmalik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashmeetmalik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/566934618","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2141#issuecomment-566934618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2141","id":566934618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjkzNDYxOA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-18T08:43:38Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T08:43:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
