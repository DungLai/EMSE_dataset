If we add an auto_increment parameter, what should happen when some metrics are logged for all epochs, while others are only logged for some? I believe this is a common pattern when evaluating a model is expensive.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I'm not sure this improvement would be worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies a process that is already quite simple (keeping track of the step manually), but at the expense of confusing more complicated use cases.\r\n\r\nI'll close this out for now, but feel free to re-open with additional supporting evidence.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/655661645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3526331917,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUyNjMzMTkxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3526331917","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T17:42:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3526331926,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUyNjMzMTkyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3526331926","actor":{"login":"cdancette","id":10550327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUwMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10550327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette","html_url":"https://github.com/cdancette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T17:42:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3526331928,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MjYzMzE5Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3526331928","actor":{"login":"cdancette","id":10550327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUwMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10550327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette","html_url":"https://github.com/cdancette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T17:42:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/655788250","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2505#issuecomment-655788250","i
