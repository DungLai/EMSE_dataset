If that's what is happening in your case, you may be able to help broaden the support. @arocketman may be willing to help you brainstorm how.

the point of change is the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/31536bd46d5c29419660c35c4f13ba1f2e6039f9/mlflow/spacy.py#L178-L195\r\n\r\nMore specifically in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/31536bd46d5c29419660c35c4f13ba1f2e6039f9/mlflow/spacy.py#L193-L195\r\n\r\nas you can see, we are applying the following:\r\n\r\n`self.spacy_model(text).cats`\r\n\r\nHowever, you can even call it with `self.spacy_model(text).ents` to retrieve, for example, the entities as specified here: https://spacy.io/api/doc#ents\r\n\r\nEach object in ents is a Span: https://spacy.io/api/span#init \r\n\r\nThe reason why I did not add in the first place the NER is that potentially you could have 100s of entities in your document, and creating a cell with all the entities inside formatted as span-string could get messy. However I think that there could be ways to make it cleaner. \r\n\r\n@ditadi what kind of output would you expect? How did you end up solving your specific case? Maybe your experience can help us brainstorm
