Thanks for filling this question. We are working on elaborate documentation to explain various scenarios for tracking server, artifact locations, model registry, etc. This relates to #3108.\r\n\r\nTo answer your questions, both the client and server have to have access to the artifact location.\r\n\r\nLaunching the server on my localhost:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri /tmp/mlruns_db  --default-artifact-root /tmp/artifacts_dir  --host 0.0.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the model registry and use an SQLAchemy compatible backend store for MLflow entities, then, supply `--backend-store-uri sqlite:////tmp/mlruns_db`. \r\n\r\nOn the client side:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    with open('test.file', 'wb') as f:\r\n        test = range(20)\r\n        joblib.dump(test, f)\r\n\r\n    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://0.0.0.0:5000\")\r\n    with mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n        run_id = run.info.run_uuid\r\n        mlflow.log_artifact('test.file')\r\n        print(f\"artifact_uri: {mlflow.get_artifact_uri()}\")\r\n        print(f\"run_id: {run_id}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nartifact_uri: /tmp/artifacts_dir/0/1addc3f3d5d04bed97af4c597dba420b/artifacts\r\nrun_id: 1addc3f3d5d04bed97af4c597dba420b\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-09-25 at 11 12 19
