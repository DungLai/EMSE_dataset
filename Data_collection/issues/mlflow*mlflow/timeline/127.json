Definitely a way to go. What do you think, do we need correct the naming for the existing functionality e.g. GetExperiment -> GetExperimentById ?\r\n@mateiz I have found couple of more touch points where experiment_id is used. \r\n1) As part of mlflow.tracking API: mlflow.tracking.start_run -> if we are getting the Experiment Object by calling GetExperimentByName we can also obtain experiment_id from it. e.g.\r\n``` \r\nexp_obj = mlflow.tracking.GetExperimentByName(\"name\")\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=exp_obj.experiment_id)\r\n```\r\nI don't think, that in this particular scenario we need to make changes in start_run function.\r\n2) As part of mlflow project API: CLI interface allows to pass experiment_id as an argument, I think we should allow experiment_name also there. I see two possibilities there:\r\na) add experiment_name as parameter to every single function on the way and add parameter handling chunk where we check which parameter was actually passed and which one held to its default value.\r\nb) get experiment object -> extract_id -> pass experiment_id to projects.run (cli.py line 97) and rely on previous logic\r\n3) CLI experiments -> actually here I am not sure. At this moment it supports only FileStore backend. On the other hand it supports only two API calls: create and list, which are implemented also in RestStore class. Maybe there is a special reason for that which I don't see. Also, is there any intention to add more commands there such as GetExperimentById and GetExperimentByName. Could you please clarify a bit here

of the concerns about changing interfaces is that it affects a whole bunch of users. I would not recommending changing `GetExperiment` APIs name or what it does. We expect people to know their experiments by # more than names, because of the most the APIs use `experiment_id` (more on that in a bit). My input on your thoughts above\r\n\r\n1) I think that usage makes sense. Maybe users can add a check for `None` returned, but using the same Experiment object means will help.\r\n\r\n2) My concern with adding `name` as an additional argument to all CLI/python APIs is that each of them need to implement some boiler plate handling code: precedence checks between `id` vs `name` arguments, what if they dont match, what if they are both null ... etc? The other solution of possibly duplicating all APIs to handle `id` version (what we have currently) and new set for `name` version. The concerns I have with that is a lot of replicated code, and if we add a new unique way of identifying experiments like `GetExperimentByArtifactLocation` that would be another flavor.\r\n\r\nIt is a legit ask to be able to query experiments by id and name (for now). Those apis definitely could be added. For everything else, my recommendation is that we stay with the flow that does\r\n - get_experiment (by id) OR get_experiment_by_name\r\n - null and other checks on returned object\r\n - use experiment_id from returned object for all APIs.\r\n\r\n3) As above, it definitely makes sense to have a first class query level API to \"get experiment by name\". We should add that to AbstractStore interface and then add those all store implementations and then expose that out using both Python and REST API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/403159291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/403242749","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/127#issuecomment-403242749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/127","id":403242749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzI0Mjc0OQ==","user":{"login":"cryptexis","id":1158677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTg2Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1158677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis","html_url":"https://github.com/cryptexis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptexis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-07T21:03:07Z","updated_at":"2018-07-07T21:03:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can't disagree, all makes sense!
