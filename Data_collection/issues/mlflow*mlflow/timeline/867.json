MLflow does not actually implement code versioning. Instead it delegates code versioning to git (mlflow.source.git.commit tag). For data versioning, we should similarly delegate it to custom providers.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n- Data versioning is more complex than code versioning. For code we simply have to deal with Python and its conventions. There is much more variety with data: file or folder, cloud vendor-specific APIs, local file system, etc.\r\n- Add a new object to Run (or Run.Data) called DataSource. \r\n- DataSource would be an extensible plug-in similar to artifact repository.\r\n- DataSource itself is an abstract class that contains a Validator and a list of data source paths.\r\n- The Validator is responsible for checking that the paths exist and that the data is \"valid\".\r\n- The training code would then retrieve its data from each DataSource path.\r\n- Some DataSource providers: DVC, Pachyderm, Databricks Delta versions, S3 or local file system with no version control, S3 or local file system with file hash check, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/583944805/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amesar","id":1721873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1721873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar","html_url":"https://github.com/amesar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amesar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3107166737,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMxMDcxNjY3Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3107166737","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-06T23:12:54Z","label":{"name":"Under

Everyone, \r\n\r\nI am a maintainer of the [Hangar](https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py) project for data versioning.\r\n\r\nI have the same question as @tfurmston above. We'd like to integrate with ML flow, but don't have a clear picture of how to make that happen. As mentioned above, data versioning is fairly complex, and the approaches taken by each of the individual tools are wildly different. How can we work together on this? \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nRick ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/652488611/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rlizzo","id":17350115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzUwMTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17350115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo","html_url":"https://github.com/rlizzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlizzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3503022813,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUwMzAyMjgxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3503022813","actor":{"login":"tfurmston","id":11030437,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDMwNDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11030437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston","html_url":"https://github.com/tfurmston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T15:30:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3503022815,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MDMwMjI4MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3503022815","actor":{"login":"tfurmston","id":11030437,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDMwNDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11030437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston","html_url":"https://github.com/tfurmston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfurmston/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T15:30:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/811293801","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/867#issuecomment-811293801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/867","id":811293801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMTI5MzgwMQ==","user":{"login":"jeanlst","id":12112853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTEyODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12112853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst","html_url":"https://github.com/jeanlst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanlst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-31T18:00:43Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T18:00:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, \r\n\r\nJust want to reiterate on this.

We might consider adding a new API say, log_input_feature, that takes a data snapshot artifact as input. Data snapshot artifact can be specified as a URL, a version id, a timestamp and a feature descriptor. Feature descriptor could contain other metadata associated with the data source.
