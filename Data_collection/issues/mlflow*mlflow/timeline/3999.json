one more question about updating an existing parameter.\r\n\r\nIn my notebook using Spark kernel, I also use MLflow python API to track experiment runs locally (e.g. parameters calculated locally on the SageMaker notebook instance, plots generated in Python locally). \r\n\r\nFrom [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64209196/how-to-update-a-previous-run-into-mlflow), I learned that using `mlflow.log_param()` can update an existing parameter value (same as the Java API). \r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to use it to update a parameter, I got `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE` error.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmlflow.end_run()\r\nrun_id = 'fe03293adb7e4c79a716c11fc938c044'\r\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_id=run_id) as run:\r\n    mlflow.log_param(\"test_rmse\", 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nError

Attempted logging new value '0'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this because MLflow by design does not allow overwrite an existing parameter? \r\n\r\nActually, I logged the parameter by mistake, can I delete an existing parameter?\r\n\r\n\"Changing param values is not allowed\" also raised when I use JAVA API. Anyway to force overwrite?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/765677541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pancodia","id":5241979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDE5Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5241979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia","html_url":"https://github.com/pancodia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/772114072","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3999#issuecomment-772114072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3999","id":772114072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjExNDA3Mg==","user":{"login":"pancodia","id":5241979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDE5Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5241979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia","html_url":"https://github.com/pancodia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pancodia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T00:34:11Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T00:34:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any
