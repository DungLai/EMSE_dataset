It actually looks like you might be able to specify gunicorn options to `mlflow models serve` simply by appending them to the end of your command, as is done in [this unit test ](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/18eacdd9bde4e693942ff94882fb3da322b593c0/tests/models/test_cli.py#L151) (e.g. run `mlflow models serve -m model_uri -w 3` to pass the `-w 3` option to `gunicorn` and run with 3 gunicorn workers). Would you be able to give that a try & see if it works? Thanks!\r\n\r\nAnd if that works, we'd welcome a contribution enhancing the docs of `mlflow models serve` to explain how to pass gunicorn options, e.g. by editing the docstring [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/18eacdd9bde4e693942ff94882fb3da322b593c0/mlflow/models/cli.py#L35)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/630494295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3349518758,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM0OTUxODc1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3349518758","actor":{"login":"Crazybean-lwb","id":22042825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDQyODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22042825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb","html_url":"https://github.com/Crazybean-lwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T23:53:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3349518761,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNDk1MTg3NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3349518761","actor":{"login":"Crazybean-lwb","id":22042825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDQyODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22042825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb","html_url":"https://github.com/Crazybean-lwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crazybean-lwb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T23:53:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/630494974","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2846#issuecomment-630494974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2846","id":630494974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMDQ5NDk3NA==","user":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"cr
