I've created a small repo for you to reproduce. \r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/FlorisHoogenboom/mlflow-double-runs/tree/master) to reproduce the issue on 6.6-ml. See here to run the same project on [7.3-ml-lts ](https://github.com/FlorisHoogenboom/mlflow-double-runs/tree/dbr7.3)(which does not create double runs). Both use `mlflow=1.12.1` in their `environment.yaml` file ([here](https://github.com/FlorisHoogenboom/mlflow-double-runs/blob/4ed0cae5a04579441d1a037d7e44343cafe16260/mlflow-environment.yml#L8)).\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see it does not appear on `7.3-ml`. To me that seems to point how that local backend config is interpreted on the backend.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/747502127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FlorisHoogenboom","id":14967659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTY3NjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14967659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorisHoogenboom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4125616202,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEyNTYxNjIwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4125616202","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-17T15:17:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4125616204,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMjU2MTYyMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4125616204","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-17T15:17:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/747816801","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3787#issuecomment-747816801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3787","id":747816801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzgxNjgwMQ==","user":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T01:53:47Z","updated_at"

Thank you so much for helping out here. We've been banging our head against this one for quite some time! I do feel that this is actually quite a tricky thing: the MLFlow version to start the run using the local backend is not the version specified in your projects `conda.yaml` or the version specified as the cluster dependency (as part of the submitted job). This now means that it is very easy to end up with a project where you have three different versions of MLFlow:\r\n\r\n- The version of your client\r\n- The version you specify in your projects `conda.yaml` and hence use to log\r\n- The version that comes preinstalled on the databricks runtime (and basically serves as the \"outer\" mlflow version that is used to kick of a local run on the cluster).\r\n\r\nI do think that this might be something that would be good to document a bit more (happy to submit an MR for that if you agree here), but also it might be better to just pin the version of MLFlow that is installed on the cluster level. Now if there is by default an older version of MLFlow on the runtime that is allowed, but I think it might be better to just pin the version to the same version as the client here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/c7b5c5dd3ab7281f6fd9b0d44f78589353989b46/mlflow/projects/databricks.py#L199\r\n\r\nThat solves the issue of the \"outer\" MLFlow on databricks running a different version than the local client you are running locally and hence would prevent similar issues like this one in the future! I'm also happy to adjust the linked MR to implement the solution you proposed, but maybe this is a more generic solution.
