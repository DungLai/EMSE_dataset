them?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/563046823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2864805422,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg2NDgwNTQyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2864805422","actor":{"login":"mirekphd","id":36706320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzA2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36706320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd","html_url":"https://github.com/mirekphd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T03:25:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2864805423,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NjQ4MDU0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2864805423","actor":{"login":"mirekphd","id":36706320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzA2MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36706320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd","html_url":"https://github.com/mirekphd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirekphd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T03:25:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/563046830","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1987#issuecomment-563046830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1987","id":563046830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzA0NjgzMA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T03:25:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T03:25:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank

had the same issue and found a simple workaround. I used the ```get_artifact_uri()``` function to save the path for later use. What I did is to create a run, end it after saving the uri and then starting the real run.
