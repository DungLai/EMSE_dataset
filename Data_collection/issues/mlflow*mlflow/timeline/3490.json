My original issue is a bit different from @Mika24 issue.\r\n\r\nI am working within Databricks. When I have a workspace experiement which is logging and saving aritifcats to my Azure Datalake, I expect to register a model from that workspace experiment given that artifact location. However, Mlflow is not logging the metadata correctly. When I go to register the model from the UI, it says that \"Failed registration. The given source path does not exist\" despite Mlflow having saved the artificats to my datalake itself. The metadata tracking doesnt appear to log that the models are located on my datalake and not within the Databricks mlflow
