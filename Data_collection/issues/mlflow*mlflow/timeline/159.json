It makes it much harder than it's actually implied in the second example here: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#building-multi-step-workflows.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: it's obviously possible to run things in parallel using multi-processing instead of multi-threading. It works like a charm: as expected, each process creates a proper run and logs things correctly. Using multi-threading, however, causes multiple runs to be created but everything is logged to a single run. This is the problem caused by having a global active run.\r\n\r\nRunning multiple runs sequentially also works with no problem, either using `with` or `start/end`.\r\n\r\nSo the issue is just that the `with` context does not work exactly as expected, specially after reading this:
