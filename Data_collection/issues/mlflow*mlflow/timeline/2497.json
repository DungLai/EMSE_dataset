got similar issue and it was a problem with `conda`, not `mlflow`. As I can tell you, it is probably typo in `conda.yaml` file because conda doesn't have channel **d** (as error states) but channel **defaults**.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I had a similar issue but it was related to the **missing version of Python in conda**. My `venv` operates on Python=3.8.9 and unfortunately this version was not available in conda; the solution was to change version of Python in `conda.yaml` file into Python 3.8.10. Hope this could help for someone digging here - if your serving fails within the **miniconda** script then it is very likely related to the conda itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1029361978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimonMolinsky","id":31246246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjQ2MjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31246246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonMolinsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonMolinsky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
