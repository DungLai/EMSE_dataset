I list some solutions for the same error which can help you in the future if you face the same problem.\r\n\r\nFile names. The file names should be the same suggested in MLFlow docs https://mlflow.org/ . For example not conda.yamp, but conda.yaml, as there was such problem in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3856\r\nThe conda.yaml file does not support Tab, please consider using spaces instead\r\nIn the MLProject file name 'P' should be the upper case before MLFlow 1.4. But the later versions it does not matter as explained there https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1094\r\n(In my case) MLProject file is space sensitive.
