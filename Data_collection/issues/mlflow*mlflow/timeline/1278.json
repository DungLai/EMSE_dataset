@dbczumar I've created https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/1339 to require only the fields needed at scoring time.\r\n\r\nI also thought that we could remove the schema.json, but I added an example model, the \"regression_model\", to the PR where that strategy wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nThe schema from the transformer is:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- income: scalar(base=string,nullable=true)\r\n |-- age: scalar(base=**double**,nullable=true)\r\n |-- hours_per_week: scalar(base=**double**,nullable=true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this is the schema that is stored from training time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- age: scalar(base=**int**,nullable=true)\r\n |-- workclass: scalar(base=string,nullable=true)\r\n |-- fnlwgt: scalar(base=int,nullable=true)\r\n |-- education: scalar(base=string,nullable=true)\r\n |-- marital_status: scalar(base=string,nullable=true)\r\n |-- capital_gain: scalar(base=int,nullable=true)\r\n |-- hours_per_week: scalar(base=**int**,nullable=true)\r\n |-- income: scalar(base=string,nullable=true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we, with the changes in PR #1339, we create the following schema\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- age: scalar(base=**int**,nullable=true)\r\n |-- hours_per_week: scalar(base=**int**,nullable=true)\r\n |-- income: scalar(base=string,nullable=true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen MLeap has good casting support (https://github.com/combust/mleap/blob/master/mleap-core/src/main/scala/ml/combust/mleap/core/types/Casting.scala) so it'll be able to convert the ints to doubles, as required. \r\n\r\nThis works well, because when reading this input\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"data\": [\r\n        [\r\n            17,\r\n            25,\r\n            \"<=50K\"\r\n        ]\r\n    ],\r\n    \"columns\": [\r\n        \"age\",\r\n        \"hours_per_week\",\r\n        \"income\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe PandasSplitOrientedDataFrame reads \"age\" and \"hours_per_week\" columns as Integer(s). However, creating the leapframe with those values as integers and with the fields typed as doubles in the schema gives an error. But if they're typed as Integer(s) in the input leap frame, even though they're required to be doubles by the model, MLeap is able to do this casting automatically.\r\n\r\nI suspect usually the fields will have the same types between training and scoring, so I think PR #1278 would work. Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/496175204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ancasarb","id":5312198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5312198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb","html_url":"https://github.com/ancasarb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2369096575,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM2OTA5NjU3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2369096575","actor":{"login":"kevinykuo","id":5582151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODIxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinykuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T11:08:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2369096577,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNjkwOTY1Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2369096577","actor":{"login":"kevinykuo","id":5582151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODIxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinykuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinykuo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T11:08:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2369096580,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM2OTA5NjU4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2369096580","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T11:08:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2369096582,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNjkwOTY1ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2369096582","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://

yes, schema stored at training time is the input schema (but this will contain some fields that are not required for scoring).\r\n\r\nmleap adds input/output schema for the Spark transformers and for most transformers this is straightforward to do. There's a couple, like StringIndexer or VectorAssembler, that are a bit more tricky. For e.g., StringIndexer works on any type input, so what mleap does it declares the input schema for it to be a string and handles the casting automatically (if the two types are compatible) to a string if let's say it's given an input of type integer. \r\n\r\nWhen we get the schema from the bundle/zip, for the string indexer, it'll say that it needs a string, so if we use this schema, we'll need to pass in an actual string, which may or may not be what we had during training. So we lose the automatic casting done by mleap, which now has to be done by the clients who call the predict function.\r\n\r\nTo see this, see the slight difference between the sample_input.json for the added regression model because the VectorAssembler has the input schema defined as a series of double types of vectors (of doubles).

two options to fix this issue:\r\n- Option 1: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/1339\r\n- Option 2: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/1405\r\n\r\nYou can have a look to see which one you favour - I think that if the schema at scoring time is likely to be the same as at training time, then Option 1 would be preferable.
