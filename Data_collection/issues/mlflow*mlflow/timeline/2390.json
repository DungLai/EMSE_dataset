In TF 1.X an iteration is a batch, while in TF 2.X an iteration is an epoch. To get the metrics for every epoch, you will probably want to set `every_n_iter=1`. It might be good to change the default value in MLflow when using TF 2.X so issues like this don't pop up in the future - would you be willing to make a change for that
