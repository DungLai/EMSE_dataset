In this scenario we'd have something like:\r\n\r\nFluent API:\r\n* `log_metric`, `log_metrics`, `log_param`, `log_params`, `set_tag`, `set_tags`, `log_batch`, continue to call into their client API equivalents (no code change required)\r\n\r\nClient API:\r\n* All client logging APIs besides `log_batch` (`log_metric`, `log_metrics`, `log_param`, `log_params`, `set_tag`, `set_tags`) call into `MlflowClient.log_batch`\r\n* `MlflowClient.log_batch` calls into `AbstractStore.log_batch`\r\n\r\nAbstractStore & subclasses (FileStore, RestStore, SQLAlchemyStore):\r\n* Remove `log_metric`, `log_param`, `set_tag` as they're no longer used. Note that this change is a first step towards deprecating the single-entry LogMetric, LogParam, SetTag REST APIs entirely in MLflow 1.0 (if we choose to do so), as user code will now only call into
