@dbczumar, I guess it would be a bit messy to save the model weights and class definition separately... \r\n\r\nHow about something simpler like adding a check [in save_model](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7c9ef36c338fb6eb33d8b9f5eb23b9ca556731a9/mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py#L158) of the type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef save_model(pytorch_model, ...):\r\n    ...\r\n    if isinstance(pytorch_model, torch.jit.ScriptModule):\r\n        pytorch_model.save(...)\r\n    else:\r\n        torch.save(pytorch_model, ...)\r\n```\r\nIt would allow mlflow to save torchscript models without changing much.
