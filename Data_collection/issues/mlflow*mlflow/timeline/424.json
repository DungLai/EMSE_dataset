sorry for the delayed response! I can see that it'd be nice to be able to pass an object to `log_artifact` instead of having to log a file, but it also doesn't seem too hard to write to a file & then log it, and I think the semantics of logging an object get kinda tricky - for example, if someone doesn't pass `artifact_path`, how do we determine a name for the artifact? Is it always reasonable/helpful to log a string representation of the object (some objects, e.g. models, may not have well-formed string representations) instead of raising an exception?\r\n\r\n Closing for now, but please feel free to reopen if anything else comes up - thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/515610238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2513789197,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUxMzc4OTE5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513789197","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:51:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2513789205,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxMzc4OTIwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513789205","actor":{"login":"drorata","id":2905978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDU5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2905978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata","html_url":"https://github.com/drorata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:51:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2513789206,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTM3ODkyMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513789206","actor":{"login":"drorata","id":2905978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDU5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2905978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata","html_url":"https://github.com/drorata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:51:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
