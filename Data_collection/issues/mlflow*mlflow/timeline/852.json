just tested the function setting tag, we can set te run_name without making a fake run:\r\n```\r\nfor i in range(4):\r\n    run_name = 'run ' + str(i)\r\n    print(run_name)\r\n    # start a run\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.log_param('my_parm','my_parm for ' + run_name)\r\n        mlflow.log_metric('my metric',10*i)\r\n        mlflow.set_tag('mlflow.runName', run_name)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7513062/100049174-4466a500-2e49-11eb-9fb3-1bbc8d404356.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/732647539/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pnhuy","id":7513062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTMwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7513062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy","html_url":"https://github.com/pnhuy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnhuy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
