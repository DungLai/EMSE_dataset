Thanks for filing this feature enhancement. Can you please take some moments to answer questions under Motivation? I know bits of it are articulated in summary, but nice to have them as part of the answers to those questions.\r\n\r\n> I could be willing to investigate how much effort this is and potentially implement this.\r\n\r\nExcellent! This seems like a greater effort as there are many changes and will require touching many aspects of the code.\r\nIt will require some design and review from the respected committers. Because MLflow models can be deployed to myriad environments, you'll have to account for those use cases. Or minimally, start with a common deployment environment as a\r\nthe first scenario; then add others later.\r\n\r\n> What I would like is some direction on where in the code to look for propagating those events from the GUI to the backend server.\r\n\r\n> Right now, this is not available, and the workaround is to have a small daemon running all the time, pulling information from the model registry, and deploy or undeploy models accordingly. If we could have an even triggered from MLFLOW server when a model state transition is happening, we could save a lot of time.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you are suggesting to implement two features here: \r\n\r\n1. Capture model state transitions–staging or production or archive – as events instead of running daemon that pulls the model registry.\r\n2. Once transitioned, enable a \"Deploy\" button in the UI\r\n\r\nThe first will require a serverside deployment plugin that enables a certain action to be executed when a model transitions. This could be implemented as a webhook. And the second is a result of the first, which may be interesting, as you will want to change the UI or enable the Deploy button dynamically. \r\n\r\nI'll have some team members comment on this feature enhancement request\r\ncc @sueann @smurching @xanderwebs

The url  could be passed as a configuration parameter ( deployment service url for example)  . Behind the url will be a service acting on the event .  That service can be implemented on a use case specific basis and does not need to be part of the MLFLOW source code. Of course template implementations of the service  could be added but I was not seen it as a core thing. \r\n\r\nTo your second part to include a deploy button . I was not thinking to have a deploy button , but rather a deployment to be triggered when a model is transitioned to production stage for example\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/814381605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"echarso","id":23654732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjU0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23654732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso","html_url":"https://github.com/echarso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarso/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/816809214","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4219#issuecomment-816809214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4219","id":816809214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjgwOTIxNA==","user":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T16:40:38Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T17:01:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@echarso IMHO, I believe for the first case, you are evaluating or examining what we think would be a general mechanism to provide\r\na server-side plugging interface, similar to what we have for [deployment plugins](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html#deployment-plugins) for model registry state transitions. \r\n\r\nThe idea there is the developer will implement abstract methods that will invoke user-defined webhooks. The server would check if there are any registered callbacks upon an event, such as model state transition, and invoke them. This callback could be a web request to a service. \r\n\r\nWe don't have that server-side mechanism yet, and we are happy to get community contributions. It is still better to design this as a general plugin architecture as we have for deployment plugins. As such, others can write/contribute their own server-side webhooks for CI/CD services or custom services needed or acted upon model state transitions.\r\n\r\nThis would be a huge benefit to the
