In particular, note that currently in the SQL backend, `metrics`, `params`, and `runs` are stored in their own tables, and so it seems tricky to write a SQL query to identify runs for which no corresponding param named `my_new_param` exists

like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nparams.my_new_param is null and metrics.error <= 0.05\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I'm entirely happy with the `mlflow.search_runs()` pandas approach, so if there hasn't been much demand
