mlflow.org!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/652685912/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3504541133,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUwNDU0MTEzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3504541133","actor":{"login":"gogasca","id":30065079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDY1MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30065079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca","html_url":"https://github.com/gogasca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T22:58:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3504541138,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MDQ1NDExMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3504541138","actor":{"login":"gogasca","id":30065079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDY1MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30065079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca","html_url":"https://github.com/gogasca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T22:58:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/652687443","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/866#issuecomment-652687443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/866","id":652687443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MjY4NzQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-01T23:03:53Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T23:03:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"If

Assume there’s only ever one version for the model.\r\n  * `update_deployment`: Either update the single version for the model (list versions, get the first one), or create a new version under the same model, set it as default, then delete existing one. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/652687443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3504554744,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MDQ1NTQ3NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3504554744","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T23:04:09Z","label":{"name":"area/scoring","color":"48eabc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/652800754","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/866#issuecomment-652800754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/866","id":652800754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MjgwMDc1NA==","user":{"login":"gogasca","id":30065079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDY1MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30065079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca","html_url":"https://github.com/gogasca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-02T05:58:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T05:58:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@smurching thanks for the details, I will be interested in working on this.
