","body":"@nayaks thanks for filing! As you mentioned, only direct stage transitions are currently supported via the UI.\r\n\r\nSome implementations of the MLflow REST API (e.g. the managed MLflow server in Databricks) contain extensions like stage transition requests, but this is not yet a standard part of the API spec. In particular, note that the server currently has no notion of users with which to associate stage transition requests (or manage permissions on who can create/approve transition requests) - thus I think a prerequisite might be for us to aim to solve #724, which we're happy to discuss & review proposals for.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions,
