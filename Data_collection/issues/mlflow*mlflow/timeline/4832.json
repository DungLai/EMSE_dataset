MLflow's prophet flavor supports the following version requirement: prophet>=1.0.1\r\nThe import statement that you supplied referenced \"fbprophet\" which was the package name prior to the 1.0 version release (the package was renamed from fbprophet -> prophet). \r\nIf you're looking for the prophet flavor as part of MLflow, this new flavor isn't part of the release that is part of the pypi build for version 1.20.2. It will be available in an upcoming release (likely 1.20.3). \r\nIf you'd like to test out the new flavor's functionality, you can pip install this version (which requires `prophet` not `fbprophet`) by doing a pip install from that branch: %pip install git+https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git@add-prophet-flavor\r\nI hope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/925945470/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BenWilson2","id":39283302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgzMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39283302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2","html_url":"https://github.com/BenWilson2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenWilson2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
