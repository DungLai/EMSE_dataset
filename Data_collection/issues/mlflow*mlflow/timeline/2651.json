you @jeremyjordan and @festeh : [`mlflow gc`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#mlflow-gc) is for cleaning up runs. Deleted experiments are moved to `.trash` folder in file store. In SQL store, the experiment is marked as `DELETED` but it is restorable.\r\n\r\n`mlflow gc` can certainly be extended to clean up experiments as well. I am going to convert this to an enhancement. If you or someone else wants to submit a pull request to handle experiment GC (the original implementation came in as an open source contribution as well #2265). We recommend that you write up a quick proposal with options on how it would be implemented this, API/arguments, and backend implementations before you proceed with implementation.\r\n\r\ncc:

i'll add a straw-man proposal\r\n\r\ncurrently you can clean up deleted runs like\r\n```\r\nmlflow gc --backend-store-uri ‘sqlite:///path/to/file.db’ --run-ids 1,2,3,4\r\n```\r\n---\r\nlet's instead add another layer to the hierarchy to allow both:\r\n\r\n1. cleanup of deleted runs\r\n```\r\nmlflow gc runs --backend-store-uri ‘sqlite:///path/to/file.db’ --run-ids 1,2,3,4\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand

corresponding runs. i think this is what we would want but would like to get confirmation that this is indeed desirable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/609101271/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeremyjordan","id":13970565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTcwNTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13970565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyjordan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyjordan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3294740051,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyOTQ3NDAwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3294740051","actor":{"login":"arjundc-db","id":61438563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDM4NTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61438563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db","html_url":"https://github.com/arjundc-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T23:25:33Z","label":{"name":"area/tracking","color":"48eabc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3294740053,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyOTQ3NDAwNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3294740053","actor":{"login":"arjundc-db","id":61438563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDM4NTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61438563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db","html_url":"https://github.com/arjundc-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjundc-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-01T23:25:33Z","label":{"name":"needs

Thank you @jeremyjordan and @festeh : [`mlflow gc`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/cli.html#mlflow-gc) is for cleaning up runs. Deleted experiments are moved to `.trash` folder in file store. In SQL store, the experiment is marked as `DELETED` but it is restorable.\r\n> \r\n> `mlflow gc` can certainly be extended to clean up experiments as well. I am going to convert this to an enhancement. If you or someone else wants to submit a pull request to handle experiment GC (the original implementation came in as an open source contribution as well #2265). We recommend that you write up a quick proposal with options on how it would be implemented this, API/arguments, and backend implementations before you proceed with implementation.\r\n> \r\n> cc: @dbczumar\r\n\r\nHi @mparkhe.
