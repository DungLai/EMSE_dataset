The issue seems to be that your `UI Server` *and* your `Artifact Server` are both configured with `--serve-artifacts`. When you attempt to list artifacts via the UI, a ListArtifacts request is sent to the `UI Server`, which thinks that it's serving artifacts and attempts to resolve them from the default `--artifacts-destination` of `./mlruns`. If you restart your `UI Server` and omit `--serve-artifacts`, everything should work as intended.\r\n\r\nWe'll work on adding a warning here and clarifying the docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1055784568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6164389127,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85DzhVfzwAAAAFvbR0H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6164389127","actor":{"login":"leviplj","id":7305591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7305591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj","html_url":"https://github.com/leviplj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-01T19:30:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6164389129,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85DzhVfzwAAAAFvbR0J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6164389129","actor":{"login":"leviplj","id":7305591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7305591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj","html_url":"https://github.com/leviplj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-01T19:30:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1056802958","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5377#issuecomment-1056802958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5377","id":1056802958,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx84-_YiO","user":{"login":"leviplj","id":7305591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7305591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj","html_url":"https://github.com/leviplj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leviplj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-02T11:10:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-02T11:10:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@dbczumar
