I don't see why machine learning parameters should be strings and integers and numeric, but not logical. There are many libraries and algorithms that take logical also. I just browsed the keras overview page [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) and found a few, e.g. `use_bias`, `trainable`, `run_eagerly` and I believe it's also a question of completeness of the API.\r\n\r\n> You can convert your logical to an int before logging it? \r\n\r\nYes, I could probably but don't you think it's bad practice to change the type of a parameter between declaring and logging?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/515617912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lorenzwalthert","id":10477073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10477073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzwalthert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2513841609,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxMzg0MTYwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513841609","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T22:28:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2513841610,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTM4NDE2MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513841610","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T22:28:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
