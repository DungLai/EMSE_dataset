points! I'd still argue in favor of the CLI:\r\n\r\nI think the compatibility would be even greater moving away from the `docker` package and using solely the CLI: on Fedora based systems `podman` is installed by default, for example, and can be used as a direct alias for docker - this is not possible with the docker package. On top of that, the CLI is already used to start the container anyways in mlflow, so it's not like we'd be introducing yet another interface.
