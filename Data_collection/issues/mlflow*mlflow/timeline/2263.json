questions. Given that there's no way to actually execute a torchscript model in Python (Is this correct? I couldn't find anything about a Python runtime for torchscript models, only C++), I'm not sure it makes sense to introduce a `mlflow.torchscript` Python module.\r\n\r\nInstead, for 1), could we simply persist the model in both `pytorch` & `torchscript` flavors when `pytorch.save_model` is called? Or is it not always possible / too expensive to do so? We do something similar currently in `mlflow.spark.log_model`, which accepts an `sample_input` argument that when provided, causes `mlflow.spark.log_model` to generate an `mleap` flavor in addition to the `spark` flavor - in the pytorch case, we would unconditionally generate the `torchscript` flavor.\r\n\r\nFor 2), the only code in MLflow that references the Pytorch flavor by name is within the mlflow.pytorch module itself, in order to provide a name to the flavor when saving pytorch models. Currently when we save pytorch models, we generate both:\r\n\r\n- A pytorch flavor (which is used by `mlflow.pytorch.load_model` to load the model back into a Python Pytorch model object) and \r\n- A python-function flavor (which is used by APIs like `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model` to load back an object for predicting on pandas DataFrames). \r\n\r\nGiven that there's no \"python-function\" representation of a torchscript model, the Python-function flavor implemented within `mlflow.pytorch` could simply preserve its existing implementation without any ambiguity.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/596345137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/596890855","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2263#issuecomment-596890855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2263","id":596890855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Njg5MDg1NQ==","user":{"login":"hhsecond","id":13761737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYxNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13761737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond","html_url":"https://github.com/hhsecond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-10T04:02:54Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T04:02:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@smurching \r\nSo the reason behind the existence of torchscript is that the python interpreter is probably not good for production runtime especially when you have high load. Also, Your assumption is slightly wrong about torchscript is not loadable in python runtime. You can. But that kills the purpose of torchscript and you'd better be loading the native pytorch model instead of torchscript model if your runtime is python.\r\n\r\n1. Saving in torchscript requires some effort from users (it is not automagically convertible).

Hi @hhsecond, thanks for looking into this! \r\n\r\nFrom looking at the history of this issue, my understanding is \r\n1. we want to enable users to also store torchscript version of their model in order to enable high perf scoring.\r\n2. torchsript model generation requires user input. \r\n\r\nIf that is correct, I would propose the following api change:\r\n  Add optional torchsript model argument to mlflow.pytorch.(log/save)_model functions. If the argument is provided, mlflow.pytorch module also produce torchscript flavor. We do not have to worry about loading it into python for now, since you mentioned that people are mostly interested in this if they do C++ scoring. Alternatively, we can opt to load torchscript by default in the pyfunc model load. If the torchsript flavor is not available or if it fails to load, we can fall back onto native pytorch flavor. \r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable to you?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/600350897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3139428700,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEzOTQyODcwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3139428700","actor":{"login":"hhsecond","id":13761737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYxNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13761737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond","html_url":"https://github.com/hhsecond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-17T23:37:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3139428702,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMzk0Mjg3MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3139428702","actor":{"login":"hhsecond","id":13761737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYxNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13761737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond","html_url":"https://github.com/hhsecond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-17T23:37:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/600620312","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2263#issuecomment-600620312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2263","id":600620312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDYyMDMxMg==","user":{"login":"hhsecond","id":13761737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYxNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13761737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond","html_url":"https://github.com/hhsecond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhsecond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-18T13:24:12Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T13:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes,
