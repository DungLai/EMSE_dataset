We lately picked it up again and we made it work. We can't exactly pin point the exact issue, but here are a few things that we did and how we set up things to make it work. We now use latest version of `mlflow` (atm. `mlflow==2.1.1`) and `apache/spark-py:v3.3.1` as base image. In addition we add `hadoop-aws-3.3.4.jar` and `aws-java-sdk-bundle-1.12.262.jar` to our image. We also created a dedicated **named** spark user in our image, because otherwise we ran into weird `kerberos` exceptions, because the user of the spark base image is unnamed 🤷‍♀️ (Don't ask, just weird spark foo :D) \r\n\r\nHere is the basic spark-submit command we use to submit our application:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nS3_BASE_PATH=s3a://blabla/blbas\r\n\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n  --master k8s://https://<MASTER_IP>:<MASTER_PORT> \\\r\n  --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n  --name cool_application \\\r\n  --packages=\"org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4\" \\\r\n  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider \\\r\n  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem \\\r\n  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem \\\r\n  --conf spark.executor.instances=4 \\\r\n  --conf spark.executor.processTreeMetrics.enabled=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=<IMAGE_NAME> \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image.pullPolicy=Always \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=<NAMESPACE> \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME> \\\r\n  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key=<ACCES_KEY> \\\r\n  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key=<SECRET_KEY> \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.driver.secretKeyRef.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<SECRET_NAME>:aws_access_key_id \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.executor.secretKeyRef.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<SECRET_NAME>:aws_access_key_id \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.driver.secretKeyRef.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SECRET_NAME>:aws_secret_access_key \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.executor.secretKeyRef.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SSECRET_NAME>:aws_secret_access_key \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.driver.secretKeyRef.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<SECRET_NAME>:aws_default_region \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.executor.secretKeyRef.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<SECRET_NAME>:aws_default_region \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path=\"$S3_BASE_PATH/spark\" \\\r\n  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.fast.upload=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.executor.memory=8g \\\r\n  --conf spark.executor.cores=4 \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image.pullSecrets=<PULL_SECRET_NAME> \\\r\n  --verbose \\\r\n  file:///<PATH_TO_SCRIPT>/foo.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso it helped us for debugging to set `mlflow` and `pyspark` loggers to debug. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nlogging.getLogger(\"mlflow\").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\r\nlogging.getLogger(\"pyspark\").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps. Let me know if I can help you any further or you any more questions\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1396847517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FelixGSE","id":15325844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI1ODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15325844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE","html_url":"https://github.com/FelixGSE","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixGSE/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8311244419,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85MgOMTzwAAAAHvY4aD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/8311244419","actor":{"login":"ericbuzato","id":116195340,"node_id":"U_kgDOBu0ADA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116195340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato","html_url":"https://github.com/ericbuzato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-19T11:57:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8311244432,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85MgOMTzwAAAAHvY4aQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/8311244432","actor":{"login":"ericbuzato","id":116195340,"node_id":"U_kgDOBu0ADA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116195340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato","html_url":"https://github.com/ericbuzato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbuzato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-19T11:57:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8311244459,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85MgOMTzwAAAAHvY4ar","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/8311244459","actor":{"login":"hardymis","id":22826839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI2ODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22826839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis","html_url":"https://github.com/hardymis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hardymis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-19T11:57:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8311244470,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85MgOMTzwAAAAHvY4a2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/8311244470","actor":{"login":"hardymis","id":22826839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODI2ODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubus
