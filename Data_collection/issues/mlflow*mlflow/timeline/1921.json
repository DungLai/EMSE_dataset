At our company we are facing a similar use case where it is important to track the performance of the model on several datasets separately. I am doing some research on the available ml tracking frameworks and I came across `mlflow`. \r\n\r\nIn my use case I would basically like to easily create two tables. One of them would have different runs(models) as rows and performance metrics on datasets as columns, this would allow me to quickly compare models between each other and is in fact the way we track our experiments right now. Is it something I could recreate \"out of the box\" using mlflow, leveraging the power that mlflow grants, such as linking the models with artifacts, code version and running scripts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/613421420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kwasnydam","id":32868095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODY4MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32868095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam","html_url":"https://github.com/kwasnydam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwasnydam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3504570095,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MDQ1NzAwOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3504570095","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T23:10:47Z","label":{"name":"area/tracking","color":"48eabc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/655776115","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1921#issuecomment-655776115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1921","id":655776115,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTc3NjExNQ==","user":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-08T21:49:40Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T21:49:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is an interesting idea, and a problem that I have also experienced.\r\n\r\nThis proposal may be more valuable in combination with the Model Registry, where a registered model is evaluated on some dataset(s), and logs the accuracy metrics to the tracking server.\r\n\r\nThat said, if I'm understanding correctly this would be a major change to the product direction of mlflow.
