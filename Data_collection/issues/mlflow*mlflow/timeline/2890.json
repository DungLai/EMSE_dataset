\r\n\r\nThis seems be an error from the connector code trying to create experiment table. I would debug this by trying to create the table using `sqlalchemy` library (which MLflow uses for `SqlAlchemyStore` backend) and try and create the experiment table as defined with the DML printed above. The `CHECK` keyword seems to be an issue which is required to ensure that value for  `lifecycle_stage ` field is a valid one. This is enforced by SQL Alchemy `CheckConstraint`.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n1. You may need to reach out to the creator of the library for advice on how to address this.\r\n2. Use the [plugin](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html) mechanism to support this backend for your use case. You may be able to reuse the code from `SqlAlchemyStore` implementations.\r\n\r\nTo answer your other question, I would recommend using one of the existing [Artifact Store implementations](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-stores) to store experiment run and model artifacts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/660426615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3560598750,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU2MDU5ODc1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3560598750","actor":{"login":"edgBR","id":14976422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTc2NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14976422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR","html_url":"https://github.com/edgBR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-18T05:04:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3560598751,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1NjA1OTg3NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3560598751","actor":{"login":"edgBR","id":14976422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTc2NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14976422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR","html_url":"https://github.com/edgBR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgBR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-18T05:04:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3560599422,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzU2MDU5OTQyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3560599422","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-18T05:05:01Z","label":{"name":"help
