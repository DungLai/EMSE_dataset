By default this external run is created in `Default experiment, with experiment_id = 0` unless specified with `--experiment-id` argument. Please refer to [mlflow.create_run](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run) documentation for more details on how each of these arguments are used.\r\n\r\nFor your use case, you can use one of these 2 options:\r\n\r\n1) Run this as a python command `python training.py` and your code will create a run with the `experiment_id` specified as argument.\r\n\r\n2) If you want to use all the features of `MLproject` run with experimend ID specified in CLI. Like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow run example/tutorial -P alpha=0.001 -P l1_ratio=0.2 --experiment-id 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for highlighting this corner case.
