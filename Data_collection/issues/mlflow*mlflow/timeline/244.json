It's actually currently possible to add new metrics/parameters to completed runs - if you pass a run ID to `mlflow.start_run()`, MLflow will resume the old run and calls to `log_metric`, `log_param` etc will write to the old run. However, it is a bit clunky in that the end time & termination status of the original run will be overwritten, and we have been thinking about refactoring the `start_run` API, which is currently overloaded to support both starting & resuming runs. I'd be curious to hear if the `start_run` workaround addresses your use case for the time being :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/412168917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1783126012,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc4MzEyNjAxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783126012","actor":{"login":"5ke","id":8723081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8723081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke","html_url":"https://github.com/5ke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T18:34:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1783126013,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3ODMxMjYwMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1783126013","actor":{"login":"5ke","id":8723081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8723081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke","html_url":"https://github.com/5ke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-10T18:34:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/412282030","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/244#issuecomment-412282030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/244","id":412282030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjI4MjAzMA==","user":{"login":"5ke","id":8723081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8723081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke","html_url":"https://github.com/5ke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-11T15:24:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T15:24:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I guess I don't really need a workaround right now since simply dumping files in the right folder already works. I'm just worried that since it's not an official method, this method may break in the future. I can see how a start_run /resume_run approach would be somewhat more future proof, but it is, as you say, still a workaround. Resuming a run sounds like continuing the training of a model, which is definitely useful, but not directly for my use case (and as a side comment, I'm in favour of having a separate resume function, simply for clarity of use reasons). I guess if parameters can be logged with a user defined x-axis component it doesn't matter much when I log them and then the resume run method would do just fine? :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/412282030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"5ke","id":8723081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8723081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke","html_url":"https://github.com/5ke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5ke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2530352013,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUzMDM1MjAxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2530352013","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T17:41:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
