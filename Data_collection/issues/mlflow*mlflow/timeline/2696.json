And maybe we'd just not be able to compare artifacts nested deeper within the run (e.g. artifacts under a subdirectory of the run's root artifact directory)? We'd also want to be careful not to overload the server e.g. if a user compares many runs (maybe we only show the artifact comparison when comparing up to 10 runs or
