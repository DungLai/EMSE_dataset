It seems like the tradeoffs are:\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Delegate to plugins for tracking URI with just the scheme component, e.g. 'azureml'\r\n#### Pros:\r\n* Smoother workflow for plugin users, as you've described^ - users don't need to worry about constructing a URI like \"azureml:\" or \"azureml:/\"\r\n\r\n#### Cons:\r\n* People without the plugin installed (e.g. first-time users getting set up with the plugin, or users running remote jobs in an environment without the plugin installed) may silently write to an `azureml` directory on the local filesystem\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Require users to specify a URI of the form azureml: etc for plugins\r\nThis is the current behavior:\r\n\r\n#### Pros:\r\n* I'm struggling to think of any. Maybe if users see code like `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"azureml:\")`, it's a little bit clearer to them that `azureml` is a plugin that they need to install, vs `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"azureml\")`? But I don't think `azureml:` is actually any more obviously a plugin than just `azureml`\r\n\r\n#### Cons:\r\n* Users need to construct unintuitive `azureml:` URIs & may inadvertently write to `azureml` directory on the local filesystem, as you described\r\n* People without the plugin installed (e.g. first-time users getting set up with the plugin, or users running remote jobs in an environment without the plugin installed) may silently write to an `azureml:` directory on the local filesystem\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the con in option 1, I expect even that issue (that users without the plugin may silently write to `azureml` on the local filesystem) will go away if we make SQL-based storage the default in the future (e.g. when we do MLflow 2.0), as then the default tracking URI will have a scheme like `sqlite:////some/absolute/path/on/my/fs` and we could consider requiring all tracking URIs to have a scheme supported by some plugin/throw an error if not (e.g. `\"No plugin installed to support tracking URI scheme 'azureml'\"`)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/694548384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3780253845,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc4MDI1Mzg0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3780253845","actor":{"login":"eedeleon","id":31962564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTYyNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31962564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon","html_url":"https://github.com/eedeleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-17T23:13:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3780253849,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3ODAyNTM4NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3780253849","actor":{"login":"eedeleon","id":31962564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTYyNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31962564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon","html_url":"https://github.com/eedeleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eedeleon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-17T23:13:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/694550955","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3415#issuecomment-694550955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3415","id":694550955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDU1MDk1NQ==","user":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-17T23:20:57Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T23:20:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thus
