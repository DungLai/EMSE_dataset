Instead, we are implementing our own tracking store that users will use by installing [our MLflow plugin](https://github.com/facultyai/mlflow-faculty/), and so the interface we will rely on is in Python rather than at the REST level.\r\n\r\nThat said, having the OSS server return non-500 error codes in appropriate situations sounds valuable.
