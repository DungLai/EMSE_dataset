thanks for filing this! Seems like there are two feature requests that came up:\r\n\r\n1. The ability to explicitly distinguish between metrics logged per batch, vs metrics logged per epoch. Is there a reason your workaround (prefixing the names of per-batch / per-epoch metrics with a string) doesn't suffice? I ask because it'd be a significant data model & REST API change to actually distinguish between a notion of \"batch\" vs \"epoch\" metrics (& add complexity to use cases where there's no notion of batches/epochs), so it may be hard to introduce that distinction as a core MLflow concept. However, I'd hope that we can address the underlying pain point using existing APIs (& if not, would love to understand how they fall short!)\r\n2. The ability to compare values of metrics at the \"best step\" across runs. Here, would it make sense to log a separate metric on each run containing the value of that metric at the best step? e.g. \"best_step_accuracy\", \"best_step_loss\", etc? You could then compare values of that metric across runs, vs having to specify the best step across different runs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/628305098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3334312002,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMzNDMxMjAwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3334312002","actor":{"login":"imaluengo","id":1993103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTMxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1993103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo","html_url":"https://github.com/imaluengo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-13T23:51:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3334312003,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMzQzMTIwMDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3334312003","actor":{"login":"imaluengo","id":1993103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTMxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1993103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo","html_url":"https://github.com/imaluengo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaluengo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-13T23:51:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3334312235,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMzMzQzMTIyMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3334312235","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-13T23:52:03Z","label":{"name":"area/tracking","color":"48eabc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3334312238,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMzMzQzMTIyMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3334312238","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"n
