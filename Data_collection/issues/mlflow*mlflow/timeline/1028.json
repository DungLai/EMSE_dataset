the run's reference to its experiment + (*)\r\n- `rest_store.py` - add new protobuf messages, create client & server handlers (in `store/rest_store.py` & `server/handlers.py`)\r\n\r\n(*) But that's not all.

The latter seems unnecessary; however to keep these references correct, one would need to move also artifacts. Alternatively, one could remove these experiment-level references.
