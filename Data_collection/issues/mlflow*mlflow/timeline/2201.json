@AveshCSingh \r\nSorry, I didn't get you - you want either me to type a new example that does execution concurrently on some language like python or you just saying mlflow run cli is not designed to to be executed concurrently?\r\n\r\nIn any cases, please keep it bound to the problem, since running mlflow on CI system is pretty basic use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/581174384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Tradunsky","id":4522842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjI4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4522842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky","html_url":"https://github.com/Tradunsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tradunsky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3000282788,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAwMDI4Mjc4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3000282788","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-02T20:35:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3000282789,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMDAyODI3ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3000282789","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-02T20:35:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/583065979","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2201#issuecomment-583065979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2201","id":583065979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzA2NTk3OQ==","user":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-06T19:18:39Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T19:18:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi

@AveshCSingh \r\nThank you for taking time to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nI think that you're right that mlflow tries to create conda env with the same name, I looked into sources and it generates name by hashing conda env content.\r\n\r\nSince mlflow defined different types of envs and makes decision on conda env re-usage, it is better to expose mlflow (CLI and libs) method to just create env. Other commands already have an option to ommit conda creation, so users might want to split conda creation and mlflow run commands.\r\n\r\nbtw, Seems like in the second example you executed it sequentially.
