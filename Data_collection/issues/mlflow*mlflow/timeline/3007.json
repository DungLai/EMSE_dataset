nice! The use case of downloading multiple artifacts seems pretty reasonable. An alternative UX for this would be to add a checkbox e.g. to the left of each artifact tree node & a download button (e.g. have a checkbox UX for selecting artifacts similar to the runs table)\r\n\r\nThis would potentially enable a select-all-artifacts-and-download-as-zip flow in the future & make it harder to misclick the download button for the wrong artifact, but also might be a bit odd in that the artifact-selection checkbox and expand-artifact-directory-toggle would be located close to each other in the UI.\r\n\r\ncc @gioa for

@harupy for working on this! I also feel the checkbox may complicate the UI. To download multiple files under one folder, can we add a download per folder (download-as-zip)? We can also extend it to a \"More actions\" icon so later we can add more actions like Copy Path in its dropdown.\r\n\r\nAlso since the primary function of this artifact viewer is to browse files, what do you think of hiding all the download icons by default? We can show the icon on hover to avoid cluttering the UI.
