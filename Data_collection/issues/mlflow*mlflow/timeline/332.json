One of the ways to get around this would be `import pyarrow` and `HadoopFileSystem` locally inside constructor for `HdfsArtifactRepository`. Something like this-\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass HdfsArtifactoryRepository(ArtifactRepository):\r\n    def __init__(self, ...):\r\n            import pyarrow\r\n            from pyarrow.hdfs import connect\r\n            self.hdfs = connect(...)\r\n    # implement other methods\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost of the model flavors (h2o, keras, pytorch ... etc) do it this way due to the same reason. As you rightly noted the heavy dependency is not loaded automatically. \r\nNote: test harness already installs `pyarrow`.\r\n\r\nOne quick question: What is the nature of your project? As you mentioned WebHDFS is a lighter protocol. What are the requirements that are necessitating a native hdfs support?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415337081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1804662437,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgwNDY2MjQzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1804662437","actor":{"login":"nilday","id":3797285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTcyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday","html_url":"https://github.com/nilday","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-23T08:34:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1804662438,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MDQ2NjI0Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1804662438","actor":{"login":"nilday","id":3797285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTcyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday","html_url":"https://github.com/nilday","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-23T08:34:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1804666575,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MDQ2NjY1NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1804666575","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-23T08:36:42Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415344217","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/332#issuecomment-415344217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/332","id":415344217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTM0NDIxNw==","user":{"login"
