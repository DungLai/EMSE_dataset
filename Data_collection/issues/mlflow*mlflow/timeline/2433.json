I'm not sure I am convinced that reverting to the \"Default\" experiment is a typical behavior that we'd want to hard-code into the fluent client. Once our users are advanced enough to explicitly choose an experiment, we'd rather that become part of the normal process for where their runs go. \r\n\r\nI'd even go so far as to recommend that you choose to write to your best models from hyperparameter search to an experiment other than \"Default\", as you or another user may accidentally forget to set the experiment and log unrelated runs to \"Default.\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/615506097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3246276039,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI0NjI3NjAzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3246276039","actor":{"login":"pogil","id":595774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil","html_url":"https://github.com/pogil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pogil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-17T23:25:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3246276045,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI0NjI3NjA0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3246276045","actor":{"login":"kbrose","id":4053170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4053170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose","html_url":"https://github.com/kbrose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-17T23:25:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3246276047,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNDYyNzYwNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3246276047","actor":{"login":"kbrose","id":4053170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4053170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose","html_url":"https://github.com/kbrose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-17T23:25:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
