thanks for raising this - would be happy to review a PR that contributes this if you're interested :)\r\n\r\nIt'd be helpful to first quickly sketch out exactly how we'd allow specifying connection

Another alternative would be to try putting the parameters in the connection string itself, but this seems likely to get messy & not play well with passing additional args e.g. when running the server from a docker image,

Due to a high runtime of the experiments, a subsequent execution is not feasible.\r\n\r\nI analyzed the number of connections opened by every run. Following the default parameterization of the SQLAlchemy engine, a pool size of 5 connections is created at startup.

I've already increased the maximum number of connections allowed by the database but there are still too many.\r\n\r\nI tried different things, incl. trying to reset the connection pool after the engine's creation, but, however, had no success.

it sounds like you might be using e.g. `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"mysql://...\")` from within your hyperparameter tuning program? The current behavior of the MLflow fluent Python APIs is indeed to create a new `MlflowClient` (and therefore a new SQLAlchemy engine, if your tracking URI is set to a DB URI like `mysql://...`) on each call to `log_metric`, `start_run`, etc - we do this to allow for dynamically pulling credentials on each function call, e.g. when logging to a remote tracking server. However, if you run the tracking server we create & reuse a single SQLAlchemy engine. Thus one approach could be to run a tracking server with `mlflow server --backend-store-uri mysql://... --default-artifact-root <your-default-artifact-root>` and configure your hyperparam tuning program to log to the server via `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://your-server's-uri\")`. \r\n\r\nI'd be curious to hear if this works for you, but happy to review a contribution making the SQLAlchemy settings configurable either way - thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/503878877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/505293479","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1452#issuecomment-505293479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1452","id":505293479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTI5MzQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"julilien","id":12819460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien","html_url":"https://github.com/julilien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julilien/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T05:49:18Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T05:49:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That sounds reasonable and solved my problem with a huge amount of jobs, thanks for that! :)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think it is helpful to configure the SQLAlchemy engine creation in many situations, e.g. for manually fixing the initial connection pool size.
