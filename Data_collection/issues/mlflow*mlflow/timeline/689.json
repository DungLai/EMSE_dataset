@agilebean : Exception when logging metrics, params, ... etc to deleted runs is expected behavior if the run has been deleted. Deleted runs are moved to `.trash` folder under the experiment.\r\n\r\nFor the other question:\r\nYes, `mlflow.end_run()` will automatically end it. However it does not \"delete it\", the system will mark the status of the runs as ended with (success, failure... etc). When using `with` syntax `end_run` is called automatically for the started run.\r\n\r\nHowever, the issue seems to be that the log statements seem to be attempting to log data for a deleted run. Please verify the following:\r\n- This is not called within another run. If a run is active it is logged in `_active_run_stack`\r\n- environment variable `MLFLOW_RUN_ID` is not set. in `mlflow.start_run` if this variable is set, system will look up that run uuid and set as active.\r\n\r\nRef: [Help for
