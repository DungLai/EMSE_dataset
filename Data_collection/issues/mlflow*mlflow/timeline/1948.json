I understand that, when the migrations have already been applied, alembic sees that there is nothing to do and exits. \r\n\r\nHowever, when productionalizing mlflow inside a cluster, I would have to have absolute control over when the migrations run, and would like to run them independently of running `mlflow server`. Unless I am missing something, it looks like currently you cannot separate the running of the application from the running of the migrations - when you run the `mlflow server`, the migrations will always try to run. \r\n\r\nI was looking for a way to disable that automatic migration behavior.
