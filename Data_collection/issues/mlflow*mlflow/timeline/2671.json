> @Roffild Did you set `artifact_location` when you created `AutoPytorch` experiment? If you didn't, artifacts would be saved in local.\r\n> \r\n> I am not sure whether this is fully related, but I start a server locally with: `mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root artifacts --host 0.0.0.0` in my project root. Then when I run a training script in `scripts/train.py` where I set\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://localhost:5000\")\r\n> mlflow.set_experiment(\"my_experiment\")\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The artifacts get saved to `scripts/artifacts` instead of the root `artifacts`-folder. Therefore, they do not show up in the UI (only when I copy them manually from the `scripts/artifacts` to `artifacts`).\r\n> \r\n> I tried setting and not setting an artifact folder when creating a new experiment as you suggested. Not setting one results in the UI displaying the artifact-folder as `./artifacts/1` and setting it results in the UI displaying it as `my_exp`. But both still get saved under `scripts` instead of the root.\r\n> \r\n> How can I save the artifacts and models under the correct folder?\r\n\r\nThe only thing that worked for me was manually assigning to the experiment\r\n\r\nmlflow.create_experiment(\"my_experiment\",
