It's on my list of adding more docs with respect to Python func flavor. I just merged a[ PR](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/4225)\r\n\r\nNext on my list is to explain at length the use case of the PyFunc Model, provide some examples in the dir examples/pyfunc/, and provide an explanation for `context`, and the difference between PythonModel and PyFuncModel. This includes saving customer models wrapped in Pyfunc flavor and able to log and register them.\r\n\r\nBut we welcome contributions, and we will be happy to review.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/816799526/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4575357075,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU3NTM1NzA3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4575357075","actor":{"login":"HansBambel","id":9060786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjA3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9060786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBambel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-09T16:24:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4575357078,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NzUzNTcwNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4575357078","actor":{"login":"HansBambel","id":9060786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjA3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9060786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBambel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-09T16:24:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5235145481,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTIzNTE0NTQ4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5235145481","actor":{"login":"HansBambel","id":9060786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjA3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9060786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBambel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBambel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T20:52:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
