initialisation\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/srv/run.sh\"]\r\n\r\n# command specifies default parameters which can be overwriten or more can be added\r\nCMD [\"--workers\", \"4\", \"--worker-class\", \"gthread\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat `run.sh` file contains a bit of app-specific setup code and then a typical `gunicorn` call:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngunicorn \\\r\n    --bind \"0.0.0.0:${PORT}\" \\\r\n    \"$@\" \\\r\n    \"app:create_flask_app()\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(note the `\"$@\"` which allows you to set parameters (like the `worker-class`) later on, without any
