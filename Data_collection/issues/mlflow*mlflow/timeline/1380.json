The run status is available through the run object but when you're collaborating or experimenting, it is useful to see at a glance what happenend in the various runs which are settled. My current workaround is to retireve the status it programmatically but it is not really convenient.\r\n\r\nI guess the UI is not the current priority for mlflow developpers which focus on the core of the product (which is really amazing btw), but let's hope it will be added in the future
