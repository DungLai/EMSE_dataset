also experimenting with serving the `mlflow server` from behind a reverse proxy that puts it on a sub-path.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the only thing that preventing me from using it as-is is the fact that the AJAX API calls to `/ajax-api/...` use an absolute path.  If I change those paths to just the relative `ajax-api/...` it seems to work fine.  (The asset URLs already seem to use relative URLs and so seem to resolve fine when hosted behind the reverse proxy with sub-url.)\r\n\r\nWould there be any issue in just making those AJAX API calls relative?
