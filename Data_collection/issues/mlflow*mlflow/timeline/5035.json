## Willingness to contribute\r\n> * [x]  Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n> \r\n> ## Proposal Summary\r\n> I want to add a separate TensorFlow Lite flavor (tflite) to the list of supported MLFlow flavors.\r\n> \r\n> ## Motivation\r\n> * _**What is the use case for this feature?**_ - To use mlflow functionality for the TensorFlow Lite models for logging runs and storing artefacts in a format, suitable to be propagated to the embedded devices without any extra change required.\r\n> * _**Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?**_ - it gives MLflow users ability to build end-to-end integration between environments when models are defined and trained and target embedded environments that support TensorFlow Lite runtime for inference.\r\n> * _**Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?**_ - I serve as a consultant for US based client with 1M+ consumer IoT devices running ML models. We are currently using Databricks for the model development and training. When there is time for the model to be propagated to the embedded device, we use custom enhancement  over mlfow.models.Model to specify log, save, load and pyfunc load logic for integration of TensorFlow Lite with MLFlow. It works as expected, but having this workaround is increasing complexity (we either need to reference custom class in each notebook by running notebook with class declaration code, or create a separate module with this class and install on cluster).\r\n> * _**Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?**_  - as specified above, it is achievable through custom class declaration using inheritance from mlflow, however, it doesn't provide proper integration and should be considered as a bed pattern.\r\n> \r\n> ### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\n> Components\r\n> \r\n> * [x]  `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n> \r\n> ## Details\r\n> If approved I can link my pull request as a proposal for implementation. I used existing implementations of the flavors as reference during development.\r\n\r\nI like this feature.
