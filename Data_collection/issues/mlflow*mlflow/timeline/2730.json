@rom1504,\r\n\r\nI am a bit confused about this part\r\n\r\n> Mlflow tracking backend currently is unable (with any of the currently supported storage backend) to scale in retrieval of runs beyond thousand of runs\r\n\r\nWith pagination support you should be able to retrieve the data you need from the backend a few hundred-thousand runs at a time. The limitation would be on how to manage the storage in the calling client (if you intend to keep all the runs in memory) but I would not categorize of this as a scale issue with backend. Indeed, with file based backed 1000s of runs will be an issue but we have seen SQL based backend scale for such use cases.\r\n\r\n### Projection of specific `columns`\r\nI agree with @dbczumar 's comment above. It would make sense to add a columns field to `SearchRuns` proto. The proposed schema from [the RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ygti9oyMbi4DJNbaM0D49nNIKb8BLXwGYQ7WmrOKJ3s/edit?usp=sharing) was something like this--\r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage SearchRuns {\r\n  option (scalapb.message).extends = \"com.databricks.rpc.RPC[$this.Response]\";\r\n\r\n  // List of experiment IDs to search over.\r\n  repeated string experiment_ids = 1;\r\n\r\n  // A filter expression over params, metrics, and tags, that allows returning a subset of\r\n  // runs. The syntax is a subset of SQL that supports ANDing together binary operations\r\n  // between a param, metric, or tag and a constant.\r\n  //\r\n  // Example: ``metrics.rmse < 1 and params.model_class = 'LogisticRegression'``\r\n  //\r\n  // You can select columns with special characters (hyphen, space, period, etc.) by using double quotes:\r\n  // ``metrics.\"model class\" = 'LinearRegression' and tags.\"user-name\" = 'Tomas'``\r\n  //\r\n  // Supported operators are ``=``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, and ``<=``.\r\n  optional string filter = 4;\r\n\r\n  // Whether to display only active, only deleted, or all runs.\r\n  // Defaults to only active runs.\r\n  optional ViewType run_view_type = 3 [default = ACTIVE_ONLY];\r\n\r\n  // Maximum number of runs desired. Max threshold is 50000\r\n  optional int32 max_results = 5 [default = 1000];\r\n\r\n  // List of columns to be ordered by, including attributes, params, metrics, and tags with an\r\n  // optional \"DESC\" or \"ASC\" annotation, where \"ASC\" is the default.\r\n  // Example: [\"params.input DESC\", \"metrics.alpha ASC\", \"metrics.rmse\"]\r\n  // Tiebreaks are done by start_time DESC followed by run_id for runs with the same start time\r\n  // (and this is the default ordering criterion if order_by is not provided).\r\n  repeated string order_by = 6;\r\n\r\n  optional string page_token = 7;\r\n\r\n  // Return only these metrics, params, and tags with the response.\r\n  // If unspecified all info and data columns are returned.\r\n  // Example: [\"metrics.accuracy\", \"metrics.mse\", \"params.layers\", \"tags.project\"]\r\n  repeated string columns = 8;\r\n\r\n  message Response {\r\n    // Runs that match the search criteria.\r\n    repeated Run runs = 1;\r\n    optional string next_page_token = 2;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a massive change and it would require writing up a design proposal on backend implementation on how this columns field will be used for projection of specific columns from the backend storage. \r\n\r\nSpecifically answer some design tradeoffs around -\r\n\r\n1. Parsing the `columns` proto field, specifically if there are any difference with the mechanisms used for parsing `order_by` field.\r\n2. Case-sensitivity? Eg: if some runs specify a metric as \"MSE\" vs others as \"mse\"\r\n3. How is the field translated to project columns using specific backends: FileStore, SQL store -- for the latter what mechanisms will be used to inject columns name the query such as to avoid SQL injection attack on backend servers\r\n4. Query design and handling query performance and tradeoffs if a users specify 1000s of column names with the `SearchRuns` API call.\r\n5. Testing plan and validation tests\r\n6. Performance tradeoffs: some additional complexity of projecting specific columns vs faster runtimes when streaming back fewer bytes\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/616331700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3250214322,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1MDIxNDMyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3250214322","actor":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T06:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3250214324,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTAyMTQzMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3250214324","actor":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T06:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3250214329,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1MDIxNDMyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3250214329","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T06:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3250214334,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTAyMTQzMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3250214334","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"

In our case when using the sql storage (30000 runs with each having hundred of metrics, tags, params) it takes more than 15min (when increasing the timeout) to retrieve the runs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the whitelisting PRs, if the main issue is to 1 list of columns instead of 3 and writing some doc/design doc on how this works, that's definitely something that we can be done. I think we could consider doing that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/616645441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3252432372,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1MjQzMjM3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3252432372","actor":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T15:56:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3252432376,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTI0MzIzNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3252432376","actor":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T15:56:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3252432383,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1MjQzMjM4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3252432383","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T15:56:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3252432386,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTI0MzIzODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3252432386","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":
