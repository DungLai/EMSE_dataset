(I personally don't like having that because they invariably get out of date and then people are worried that the website compared against an older version of their platform.)\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I think there are two main goals in MLflow that are different from several of the platforms you list:\r\n\r\n1. MLflow is meant to be an \"open\" platform in the sense that it's easy to bring in any ML library, existing code, existing deployment tools, etc, whereas a lot of the projects you mentioned are focused on a specific set of libraries (for example, TensorFlow and PyTorch) or a specific deployment environment (for example, Kubernetes). We want to allow people to string together workflows out of any component that some other team has used to implement an ML task. If some team across the world wrote a great classifier using a 25-year old R library, that's awesome: you should be able to call it as easily as you can call the latest Spark or PyTorch release.\r\n2. The specific functions supported are different, and in particular, MLflow focuses more on the ML lifecycle and less on the task of deploying jobs to a specific execution platform (such as Kubernetes). For instance, we've spent more time on an experiment tracking UI/API, on a project packaging format that's easy to share through Git, and on designing a multi-flavor model format that allows deployment to quite a few different tools (local serving, SageMaker, Azure ML and Spark ML in the current release). On the other hand, many of these platforms focus specifically on deploying jobs to Kubernetes, which we don't currently try to do.\r\n\r\nBasically, we didn't find anything that supported the large-scale, multi-library experimentation and deployment workflow that we saw people wanting to do, so we decided to focus on that.\r\n\r\nIn general though, MLflow should also be pretty complementary to many of the tools you listed. For example, you can deploy your jobs to Kubernetes using one of these but use MLflow Tracking to track experiments or MLflow Models as a format for deploying the model. MLflow's goal is mainly to let you manage the ML lifecycle regardless of which tools you use to train or run the model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/398139915/reactions","total_count":32,"+1":30,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/399153120","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/58#issuecomment-399153120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/58","id":399153120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTE1MzEyMA==","user":{"login":"rquintino","id":10835742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10835742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino","html_url":"https://github.com/rquintino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rquintino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T15:54:09Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T22:27:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"outsider

Our blog post at https://databricks.com/blog/2018/06/05/introducing-mlflow-an-open-source-machine-learning-platform.html has the overall motivation, though it might be good to write more direct comparisons on the website at some point. (I personally don't like having that because they invariably get out of date and then people are worried that the website compared against an older version of their platform.)\r\n> \r\n> In a nutshell, I think there are two main goals in MLflow that are different from several of the platforms you list:\r\n> \r\n> 1. MLflow is meant to be an \"open\" platform in the sense that it's easy to bring in any ML library, existing code, existing deployment tools, etc, whereas a lot of the projects you mentioned are focused on a specific set of libraries (for example, TensorFlow and PyTorch) or a specific deployment environment (for example, Kubernetes). We want to allow people to string together workflows out of any component that some other team has used to implement an ML task. If some team across the world wrote a great classifier using a 25-year old R library, that's awesome: you should be able to call it as easily as you can call the latest Spark or PyTorch release.\r\n> 2. The specific functions supported are different, and in particular, MLflow focuses more on the ML lifecycle and less on the task of deploying jobs to a specific execution platform (such as Kubernetes). For instance, we've spent more time on an experiment tracking UI/API, on a project packaging format that's easy to share through Git, and on designing a multi-flavor model format that allows deployment to quite a few different tools (local serving, SageMaker, Azure ML and Spark ML in the current release). On the other hand, many of these platforms focus specifically on deploying jobs to Kubernetes, which we don't currently try to do.\r\n> \r\n> Basically, we didn't find anything that supported the large-scale, multi-library experimentation and deployment workflow that we saw people wanting to do, so we decided to focus on that.\r\n> \r\n> In general though, MLflow should also be pretty complementary to many of the tools you listed. For example, you can deploy your jobs to Kubernetes using one of these but use MLflow Tracking to track experiments or MLflow Models as a format for deploying the model. MLflow's goal is mainly to let you manage the ML lifecycle regardless of which tools you use to train or run the model.\r\n\r\nHi Mateiz, what a great reply! \r\n\r\nI'm deciding what stack to adopt for my current employer and I'm having a hard time figuring out if it's possible ( or if it makes sense too) to have TFX on the models side but adopt MLFlow to manage libraries, artifacts, lifecycle, etc. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on on this?  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\nBest regards, \r\nHernán","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/528997259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hernanborre","id":17712872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzEyODcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17712872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre","html_url":"https://github.com/hernanborre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hernanborre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/529028193","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/58#issuecomment-529028193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/58","id":529028193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTAyODE5Mw==","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T21:58:10Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T21:58:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yup, it should be possible to do that.

The main idea is to use it to a variety of applications (from tabular data to images or NLP). Since I'm building up the machine learning area in this company, we are still discussing with the stakeholders which use cases will be tackled first. However, I've been working on ML/DS for a while now and I know the importance of defining a pipeline to be able to reuse models, data prep, data validation and sharing. \r\n\r\nMy only fear on
