Could you clarify a few things? \r\n1. Do you mean to update/delete experiments in Tracking, or models in Model Registry? From the title & description it sounds like you are talking about Experiments in MLflow Tracking, but you do mention `update_registered_model`, which is for updating the description of a model in model registry.\r\n\r\n2. I think there are a few things you want to see based on\r\n> I want to update or permanently delete the old experiment by the client when the artifact location of the experiment has changed. In addition, the name of the experiment is fixed.\r\n  * To be able to update the artifact location of an experiment\r\n  * To be able to delete an experiment and have the artifacts logged to the experiment also be deleted\r\n  * To be able to change the name of an experiment (does `MlflowClient.rename_experiment` work for you?) \r\n\r\nIs that correct?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/691739316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sueann","id":4411489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTE0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4411489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann","html_url":"https://github.com/sueann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3760924337,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3NjA5MjQzMzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3760924337","actor":{"login":"sueann","id":4411489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTE0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4411489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann","html_url":"https://github.com/sueann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sueann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-13T23:56:05Z","label":{"name":"needs
