Great question! We recommend following the guidance in https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#custom-python-models. Once you've logged a model with autologging, you can follow these instructions to create a new model based on your logged model that adds preprocessing / postprocessing capabilities. Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you for using MLflow!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1119136153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6560135803,"node_id":"CE_lADOCB5Jx85JG2XQzwAAAAGHA7p7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6560135803","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-05T23:27:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6560135811,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85JG2XQzwAAAAGHA7qD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6560135811","actor":{"login":"saichandrapandraju","id":41769919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzY5OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41769919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju","html_url":"https://github.com/saichandrapandraju","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-05T23:27:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6560135812,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85JG2XQzwAAAAGHA7qE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6560135812","actor":{"login":"saichandrapandraju","id":41769919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzY5OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41769919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju","html_url":"https://github.com/saichandrapandraju","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-05T23:27:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos

@dbczumar , Thanks for the reply!\r\n\r\nYou're suggesting to create a new python model with inference logic and log this model before deploying. Is my understanding correct ?\r\n\r\nBut what if I want to add inference script on-the-fly while deploying ? \r\nThe main reason for asking this is - \r\nI will have multiple runs and delegate logging (params, metrics, artifacts) to MLflow. \r\nAfter multiple runs, I register a model with best performance. Now if I want to deploy the model using `model_name` and `version` AND want to control the inference logic, I couldn't find a way to add a custom script.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1119399117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"saichandrapandraju","id":41769919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzY5OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41769919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju","html_url":"https://github.com/saichandrapandraju","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saichandrapandraju/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6562004937,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85JG2XQzwAAAAGHID_J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6562004937","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-06T08:54:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6562004942,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85JG2XQzwAAAAGHID_O","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6562004942","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-06T08:54:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
