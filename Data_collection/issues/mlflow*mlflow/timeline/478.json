","body":"I think I've found the issue - [MetricReducer](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/reducers/MetricReducer.js)'s methods set metric data both in response to successful GetRun and GetMetricHistory REST API requests. GetRun returns just a single value for each unique metric in a run, while GetMetricHistory returns the entire history of the metric data. The [MetricPage](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/components/MetricPage.js#L28) component fires both GetRun and GetMetricHistory actions to obtain data for the MetricView component. The non-deterministic behavior comes from the fact that the available metrics are set based on whichever of {GetRun, GetMetricHistory} finish last. I'll look more into a specific fix tomorrow, just wanted to write out what I'd found.
