I also am aware that there are other options such as mlflow projects and docker builds that can bundle everything together. In hindsight it's now obvious that most of the examples either imply or explicitly show training and inference happening in the exact same environment. \r\n\r\nSince my dependencies are different between my training and inference environment (the former has more deps than necessary for inference) I'm going to look into `mlflow models prepare-env` as a build-time way of using an artifact definition to ensure the inference environment is correct. If that is the correct way to manually prepare an environment before using `load_model` it might be worth putting a note or example in the docs. Or if there is a different established recipe to do that, please let me know.
