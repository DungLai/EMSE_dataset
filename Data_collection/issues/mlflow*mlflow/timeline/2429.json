As per cloudpickle's [README](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle#cloudpickle):\r\n> \r\n> > Using cloudpickle for long-term object storage is not supported and strongly discouraged.\r\n> \r\n> Why not use regular Python pickle for long term object storage in MLflow?\r\n\r\nHi @ogrisel , unfortunately, Python pickle doesn't provide support for deserializing objects defined in the `__main__` scope of a Python script or in an interactive notebook environment unless the user also packages and re-imports their `__main__` / notebook code along with the set of pickled objects. Capturing and shipping notebook code along with a serialized ML model is often cumbersome for developers, which is why we've adopted it for MLflow Models. Let me know if you have any insight into how to achieve this goal without depending on cloudpickle or how to make our usage of cloudpickle more robust.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/698010099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3800661804,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgwMDY2MTgwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3800661804","actor":{"login":"ogrisel","id":89061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel","html_url":"https://github.com/ogrisel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T22:45:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3800661807,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MDA2NjE4MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3800661807","actor":{"login":"ogrisel","id":89061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel","html_url":"https://github.com/ogrisel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-23T22:45:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/698436566","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2429#issuecomment-698436566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2429","id":698436566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODQzNjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"ogrisel","id":89061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel","html_url":"https://github.com/ogrisel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-24T16:00:18Z","updated_at":"2020-09-24T16:00:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You
