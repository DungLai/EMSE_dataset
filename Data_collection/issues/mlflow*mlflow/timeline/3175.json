Thanks for filling this enhance issues. \r\n\r\nRegistered models' stages and versions change over the course of none, testing, and productizing. For example, you might add/update the description or add a search tag to a registered model in any of these stages.  So freezing a model just because a version of it is a model registry may not be optimal for the model registry workflows. \r\n\r\nPerhaps, once it has transitioned to the \"production\" stage, then, it might be something to consider. Even in the production stage, though, you can have a new model version that can be transitioned to production, [optionally archiving the older versions](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html#mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient.transition_model_version_stage). So freezing updates here may not allow these workflow operations. \r\n\r\n@mparkhe or @sueann Any insights into this

That is if that run_id is associated with a registered model and version, you may effectively change the model's associated artifacts logged at the time of its initial training run, followed by registering that run (and its associated run_id).\r\n\r\n> For me, the model registry should function more or less like an artifact store similar to maven central, pypi, etc. from where consumers can obtain artifacts (e.g. models) that will not change. If a change is made, that should result in a new version, not something being changed in an existing one.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a model should be frozen, but metadata such as description/tags/etc. should be editable?\r\n\r\nIn general terms, each experiment runs when registered creates a new version and its associated artifacts. So when you fetch model from the registry by the version or by stage, you get that unmodified version (except with the above way of modifying :-)). \r\n> Perhaps a model should be frozen, but metadata such as description/tags/etc. should be editable?\r\n\r\nAnd one way to eschew from changing artifacts is to have a separate model registry artifact store, where you can copy the artifact associated with the newly registered and versioned model; those artifacts remain unaltered, even when. using the above call.\r\n\r\nI have looped in the committers @sueann and @mparkhe.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute, this will require some design work.

If someone goes in to the S3 location the model files are stored in, I don't think it's MLflow's \"fault\" if things behave unusually. Perhaps a check in the `MlflowClient.log_artifact` function would be a good place to start. I'll look into it!\r\n\r\nI think it definitely should be a configuration option. Perhaps a default on the MLflow instance level, with the option to override the default for specific models?  \r\n\r\nI hope to have some time to work on this next week.

did a bit of digging around in the code and I have a rough idea of what we could/should do to achieve this. I've tried to structure my thoughts as best as possible and hope you can follow along. If anything is unclear or if I've missed/misunderstood anything, please let me know!\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nCurrently, it's possible to overwrite artifacts stored with an MLflow run, even if that run has been registered as a model in the model registry. The consequence of this is that the artifacts of registered model versions can be changed. For downstream consumers this can be both very confusing, but more importantly very dangerous. \r\n\r\n## Proposed approach\r\nThe proposed approach to resolving this problem is as follows:\r\n1. In `mlflow server` a function would be added which indicates whether or not a model_run can be modified. It should be possible to modify a model_run by default. However, if a flag is set blocking this, the server should indicate that it should not be changed.\r\n2. Any functions that may have a possibly destructive or otherwise behaviour-altering effect on a registrered model should query the server with that run_id, asking it whether it is possible to log artifacts or delete the run.\r\n![Untitled Diagram(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4234426/90641407-7f957e80-e231-11ea-9941-84f6240e4996.png)\r\nThe functions I think are affected by this are:\r\n- `log_artifact`\r\n- `log_artifacts`\r\n- `delete_run`\r\n3. `mlflow server` would by default allow overwriting all artifacts and/or deleting all runs. This is the current default behaviour, and this proposal would not change that. Instead, a flag would be added that can indicate that registered models should not be mutable. \r\n4. We probably want an additional function for the model registry store. Currently, the  store uses only the model name as the key with which to query it. The consequence of that is that if you have a run_id, and you want/need to check that there is no existing model registered with that run_id, you would need to list all registered model versions and iterate over all of them. This seems like something that could/should be done using the database rather than this brute-force approach.\r\n\r\n## Consequences\r\n- The current default behaviour would not change\r\n- An additional function would be added to the registry store in order to quickly retrieve registered models, given a run_id.\r\n- An additional function would be added to the server to check if one of the possibly destructive functions can be run safely (assuming the aforementioned flag is set)\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\nI have a few questions regarding this:\r\n1. I think this should indeed be configurable behaviour, with the default behaviour being the existing one. The proposal above is to add a flag to the `mlflow server` cli that can be set when starting it. I was looking for a configuration file for this kind of field, but could not find one. Is there one?\r\n2. For point 4, is going to the database the best approach for this? It seems to me it is, as registries could contain thousands of models, and brute-force iterating is probably best avoided.\r\n\r\nVery curious to hear what you think!
