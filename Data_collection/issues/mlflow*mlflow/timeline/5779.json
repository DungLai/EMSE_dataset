@pimdh , thank you for raising this! We would be very excited about integrating https://github.com/predict-idlab/plotly-resampler to improve plot scalability. I think it would be best to introduce a toggle that users can select to explicitly enable sampling, ensuring that they can still access the complete set of data (even if it's slow). We would be thrilled to review and provide guidance on a PR that implements this capability! Please let me know if you have any questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1110478473/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6503349371,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85Id3PWzwAAAAGDoTx7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6503349371","actor":{"login":"pimdh","id":459819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/459819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh","html_url":"https://github.com/pimdh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-27T02:57:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6503349378,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85Id3PWzwAAAAGDoTyC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6503349378","actor":{"login":"pimdh","id":459819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/459819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh","html_url":"https://github.com/pimdh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-27T02:57:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6504896506,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCB5Jx85Id3PWzwAAAAGDuNf6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6504896506","actor":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-27T08:23:04Z","rename":{"from":"[BUG]

@dbczumar,\r\nIt seems like the library I mentioned is based on the Dash framework and thus appears difficult to integrate with the existing code-base.

Unfortunately, it's challenging to make such changes to the MLflow service API without substantial debate & coordination because it's implemented by a variety of third-party providers (e.g. Databricks, AzureML). Since the issue appears to be restricted to Plotly performance, can we subsample on the frontend before passing datapoints to plotly?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1116450421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6543132884,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85Id3PWzwAAAAGGAEjU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6543132884","actor":{"login":"pimdh","id":459819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/459819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh","html_url":"https://github.com/pimdh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-03T18:54:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6543132895,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85Id3PWzwAAAAGGAEjf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6543132895","actor":{"login":"pimdh","id":459819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/459819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh","html_url":"https://github.com/pimdh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pimdh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-03T18:54:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6543132907,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85Id3PWzwAAAAGGAEjr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6543132907","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-03T18:54:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6543132915,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85Id3PWzwAAAAGGAEjz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6543132915","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.co
