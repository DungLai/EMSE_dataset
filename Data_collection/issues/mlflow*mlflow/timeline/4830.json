Export MLFLow Tracking Server variable like this code below.\r\n```\r\nexport MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=your_tracking_uri\r\nexport MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME=\"your_experiment_name\"\r\n```\r\n2. Run your MLflow Project with this command line.\r\n```\r\nmlflow run [your/where/MLproject Folder] --no-conda # if you don't want use conda env\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- You must remove mlflow.start_run() in your python code, if you don't remove this line it will create 2 running experiments and create errors\r\n- You don't have to use ```mlflow.set_tracking_uri()```, because it is already set in your environment variables.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope it will work for you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1120550356/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Clayrisee","id":54859935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODU5OTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54859935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee","html_url":"https://github.com/Clayrisee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Clayrisee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1201825786","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4830#issuecomment-1201825786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4830","id":1201825786,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85Homf6","user":{"login":"nfarley-soaren","id":92752316,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYdJvA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92752316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren","html_url":"https://github.com/nfarley-soaren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfarley-soaren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T23:10:41Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T15:52:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm using a remote tracking server and I initially had the same problems running a project using `mlflow run .` from the CLI.  When I tried to use the `with mlflow start_run` command with my normal script setup, I also got a \r\nRESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST error.  when I used `run = client.create_run(experiment_id)\r\nrun = mlflow.start_run(run_id = run.info.run_id)` suggested by @metalglove I end up kicking off 2 runs which is why the git commit id doesn't show up, it is only present for the first run.   When I tried the solution proposed by @Clayrisee after removing `mlflow.start_run()` everything was logged to one remotely tracked run (as desired).  To get the same result, you can use the sdk and run the project using a python script with the `mlflow.projects.run()` command.  If you're working from a windows machine, you'll want to make sure you're using the latest version of mlflow (1.27.0) or you might run into this [error](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5998).  As and edit to that recommendation, I would pass the experiment name to the `mlflow run` or sdk method rather than declare it as an environment variable.  I played around with it some more and found that the main issue was that I was also trying to create/set an experiment at the top of my script (as one often sees outside of using mlflow projects).  When I removed that and added back `with mlflow.start_run()` everything worked with both the CLI command and the SDK and only one run seems to have been created.  It is buggy and was a little confusing at first.  The main issue that I have is that you have to change how/where you set your experiment if you're using projects vs. running a stand-alone python script.  I also don't know yet how to specify a specific artifact location.  Right now I'm logging everything to S3 and it's automatically creating a directory named with the experiment_id.  When creating my experiment in a stand-alone scripts, I was able to give this folder a meaningful name.  But I might just not have found how to do this yet with projects.
