More than happy to answer any specific questions you have about Model Flavor development. As a reference, I would recommend taking a look at a recent pull request that introduced an XGBoost flavor to MLflow: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2124. In particular, the `mlflow/xgboost.py` implements the new flavor logic and APIs (i.e., `log_model`, `save_model`, `load_model`, and `get_default_conda_env()`. We also recommend introducing a Gensim flavor example once the feature has been implemented (see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2186 for reference about how to write examples for new flavors).\r\n\r\ncc @dmatrix for input about documenting new flavors, introducing code snippets, and adding

@dbczumar \r\n\r\nI was coding the gensim flavor, but it has some particularities and those are the ones I want to address with you.\r\n\r\nIn particular, gensim has many different models
