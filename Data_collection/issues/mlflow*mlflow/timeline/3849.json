yes, but it needs a bit of work. \r\n\r\nThe tricky part about categoricals is that the dictionary can be different between training and inference data. So you need to store the mapping seen during training and make sure you map the data the same way at inference time. You also need to handle categories unseen during training. We would also need to figure out where to store these additional dictionaries - probably as additional artifacts. It can be done, but it is not clear how often would people use this instead of using something like scikit pipeline.
