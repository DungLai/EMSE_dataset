is an interesting feature I hear about a lot. There are many cases where you need to manage models all together in groups because they make sense all together only. For instance, when you apply an stratified modeling approach. The general guidance here is (I think) to manage all the models as a single entity, like a ensemble. However, in some more upscaled scenarios (like an industrial scenario) you may easily have ensembles of 1000s of models. Logging them all together results challenging. Tags or naming conventions is an alternative, but they also suppose an overhead in administration.\r\n\r\n@Crazybean-lwb I'm curious to know which other type of operations would you be interested to
