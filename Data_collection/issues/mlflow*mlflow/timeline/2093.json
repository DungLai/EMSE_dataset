What is that artifact location for `experiment_id = 0`? If it isn't properly showing your default artifact location, Id make a new experiment (which should pickup your default artifact location) and then make sure that the `start_run` within `train.py` references the correct experiment_id (which you can [set as a parameter](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run). With the new experiment and the model saving there, hopefully it will properly define the artifact location.\r\n\r\nNot totally sure why the second error is happening, but your model is likely getting logged to the tracking server properly, just the artifacts aren't saving.
