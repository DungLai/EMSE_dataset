So the MLflow required the Nginx or Apache for authentication right?\r\n> If I don't want to work with Nginx or Apache, It's anyway to used this feature?\r\n\r\nAs you may have discovered by now, you are correct -- MLflow does not support authentication out of the box. If you set either the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN` or both the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME` and `MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD` environment variables, then an \"Authorization\" header will be set on the HTTP requests that MLflow makes. You will need to run a proxy that supports authentication via values passed through request headers.\r\n\r\n* In the case of basic authorization, setting `MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME` and `MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD` will set the header `Authorization: Basic {user}:{password}`.\r\n* In the case of Bearer token authorization, setting `MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN` will set the header `Authorization: Bearer {token}`.\r\n* If all 3 variables are set, then basic authentication will take precedence.\r\n\r\nA slightly lower-level view, based on some quick navigation through the codebase (GitHub search picked commit 11898c5, published a few days ago, so I believe this is still relevant): these environment variables are injected into an [`mlflow.utils.rest_utils.MlflowHostCreds`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/11898c564207ce7bfc7ba89636f93584e885ac90/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py#L235) object by the `mlflow.tracking._tracking_service.utils._get_default_host_creds` function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/11898c564207ce7bfc7ba89636f93584e885ac90/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/utils.py#L120-L129\r\n\r\nThe `MlflowHostCreds` object is used by the [`mlflow.utils.rest_utils.http_request`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/11898c564207ce7bfc7ba89636f93584e885ac90/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py#L25) function. This extracts the credentials to build an authentication string, `auth_str`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/11898c564207ce7bfc7ba89636f93584e885ac90/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py#L41-L45\r\n\r\nAnd then sets the header appropriately:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/11898c564207ce7bfc7ba89636f93584e885ac90/mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py#L50-L51\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, that is the extent of MLflow Tracking Service's built-in authentication support. As noted above, you would need to capture incoming requests to the server (via a separate service/proxy), check the \"Authentication\" header, and then determine whether to allow the request to be passed to the MLflow server or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/827132853/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"themowski","id":13295249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjk1MjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13295249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski","html_url":"https://github.com/themowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/themowski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
