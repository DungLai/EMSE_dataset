Yes, this should work.\r\n\r\nSo if I'm running a reverse proxy with NGINX, proxy passing the location as `location /mlflow`, is it sufficient to be running the server with `--static-prefix /mlflow` or there are some other adjustments that need to be done? Ex. when setting the tracking uri etc.\r\nA mini insight on this a bit detailed would be much appreciated. Especially since there are no real example on the matter or any resource/docs whatsoever.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1104554333/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"browser-bug","id":44030022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDMwMDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44030022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug","html_url":"https://github.com/browser-bug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/browser-bug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6466936995,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx84k0xLwzwAAAAGBdaCj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6466936995","actor":{"login":"jhallard","id":7551586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTE1ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7551586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard","html_url":"https://github.com/jhallard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-20T23:37:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6466937000,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx84k0xLwzwAAAAGBdaCo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6466937000","actor":{"login":"jhallard","id":7551586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTE1ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7551586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard","html_url":"https://github.com/jhallard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhallard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-20T23:37:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1281086854","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2823#issuecomment-1281086854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2823","id":1281086854,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85MW9WG","user":{"login":"tpanza","id":19810086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODEwMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19810086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza","html_url":"https://github.com/tpanza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpanza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-17T15:48:52Z","updated_at":"2022-10-17T15:48:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For
