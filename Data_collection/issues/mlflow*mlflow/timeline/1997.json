problem is still present, I have been facing it with the latest version of Sparkling Water (sparkling-water-3.30.0.3-1-2.4)\r\n\r\nIt appears to be an easily fixed bug in the way H2O is called to serialize the model, the S3 backend of Mlflow works flawlessly.\r\n\r\nHere is what I have found:\r\nIt works correctly in standalone H2O without Spark and the model is correctly serialized to S3.\r\n\r\nHowever, the reported behavior appears when using H2O in distributed mode over a Spark cluster with pysparkling. Mlflow uses h2o.save_model internally to serialize the model, according to the source code. Unfortunately, in pysparkling this call is executed in the worker node. The file is correctly saved but in the worker (!?), not in the driver node, as it should instead.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to save the H2O model with h2o.download_model instead of h2o.save_model which saves the model in the driver node instead of in the worker.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/636157634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"delcacho","id":2689729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODk3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2689729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho","html_url":"https://github.com/delcacho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delcacho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3413647253,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzQxMzY0NzI1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3413647253","actor":{"login":"juntai-zheng","id":39497939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng","html_url":"https://github.com/juntai-zheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntai-zheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-05T23:07:14Z","label":{"name":"stale","color":"828282"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/639885784","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1997#issuecomment-639885784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1997","id":639885784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzOTg4NTc4NA==","user":{"login":"zhidongqu-db","id":64800904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODAwOTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64800904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/zhidongqu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-05T23:10:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T23:10:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@delcacho Hey, we have look into the problem and indeed it seems like this is because we are using an older version of H2O which does not support the `h2o.download_model` method.
