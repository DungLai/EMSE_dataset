As you know documentation is the first go-to source for any developer and having it be informative and intuitive, we have to strive to make all APIs consistent, for each language supported, at par. \r\n\r\nWe have tried to add code examples and snippets for Python MLflow fluent API. One goal would be to follow that standard for the Java/Scala APIs too. Thanks for your contribution. Please read our contribution guide for docs and how to build and test them.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any questions, and we will work with you on your pull requests.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJules","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/861627291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4892672010,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDg5MjY3MjAxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4892672010","actor":{"login":"awssenera","id":45044339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDQ0MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45044339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera","html_url":"https://github.com/awssenera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-15T16:04:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4892672017,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ4OTI2NzIwMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4892672017","actor":{"login":"awssenera","id":45044339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDQ0MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45044339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera","html_url":"https://github.com/awssenera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-15T16:04:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4894160658,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDg5NDE2MDY1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4894160658","actor":{"login":"awssenera","id":45044339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDQ0MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45044339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera","html_url":"https://github.com/awssenera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awssenera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-15T21:28:52Z","rename":{"from":"[DOC-FIX]
