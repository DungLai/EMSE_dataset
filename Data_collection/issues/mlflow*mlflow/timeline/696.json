If memory is not a constraint, one of the ways to do that would be to use [python_function with custom loader](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#built-in-deployment-tools) to load in multiple models and use parameter to execute a particular model. However, this will always have memory limitations and put constraint on number, size, and types of models you can pack into a single container.\r\n\r\nA scalable way to approach this would be use some load balancing + routing logic to route traffic to appropriate hosts based on model being executed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/437696249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1959001798,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk1OTAwMTc5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1959001798","actor":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-11T19:12:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1959001799,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NTkwMDE3OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1959001799","actor":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-11T19:12:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/438080800","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/696#issuecomment-438080800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/696","id":438080800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODA4MDgwMA==","user":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T00:21:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T00:21:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nI was planning to experiment with a simple configuration to throw the same data for multiple models.ã€€At that time, I felt it troublesome to execute the serve command every time. So I threw this issue. \r\n\r\nI understand that when multiple models are deployed at the same time, memory limit problems arise.\r\nFor trial, I've created a script to load the model each time the API is called. However, although this script can solve the problem of memory limit, it is not very effective because there is a problem in responsiveness.\r\n\r\n As you say, in large projects I understand that load balancing + routing logic is good to use.\r\n\r\nthank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/438080800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1961712426,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk2MTcxMjQyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1961712426","actor":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T00:28:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
