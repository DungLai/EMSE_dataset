thus it'd be helpful to know what use cases you had in mind","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/460436003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2117029065,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjExNzAyOTA2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2117029065","actor":{"login":"eyadsibai","id":935729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTcyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/935729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai","html_url":"https://github.com/eyadsibai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-04T22:19:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2117029067,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMTcwMjkwNjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2117029067","actor":{"login":"eyadsibai","id":935729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTcyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/935729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai","html_url":"https://github.com/eyadsibai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-04T22:19:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/460552686","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/863#issuecomment-460552686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/863","id":460552686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDU1MjY4Ng==","user":{"login":"eyadsibai","id":935729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTcyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/935729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai","html_url":"https://github.com/eyadsibai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyadsibai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-05T08:31:21Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T08:31:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you!
