this thread as I think it would be an incredibly useful feature where I currently work. We're currently leveraging the Databricks hosted MLflow instance and being able to pass in additional header content would allow for more flexible model pipelines. The use case I have been investigating is record linkage and having the ability to signal which dataset is being used and how to treat it or which model to select for that particular dataset would be incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nThis is a feature that I'd love to contribute but could use a little guidance on. @zhidongqu-db, would you be able to point me in the right direction with this? I understand that it's a Flask application, what I'm not clear on is the entry point to the model itself when a post request comes in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1070961579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DOH-WLD0303","id":76453672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDUzNjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76453672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303","html_url":"https://github.com/DOH-WLD0303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DOH-WLD0303/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6259702276,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx84cIWEBzwAAAAF1G3oE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6259702276","actor":{"login":"zhidongqu-db","id":64800904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODAwOTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64800904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/zhidongqu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-17T14:17:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6259702281,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx84cIWEBzwAAAAF1G3oJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/6259702281","actor":{"login":"zhidongqu-db","id":64800904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODAwOTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64800904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/zhidongqu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhidongqu-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-17T14:17:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
