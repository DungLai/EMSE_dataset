Is there a place where I can find more information\nabout the move to pypi? I have a lot of questions, for example: what are\nthe new terms of services that are problematic? Does the switch to pypi\nmean all existing conda-based MLflow projects will be broken? Pypi contains\na very small subset of what is available in conda, for example, it doesn't\nprovide the CUDA toolkit and so on, how do we deal with that?\n\nRegarding the 10x speedup, some pipeline steps are as simple as \"download a\nsmall file\" or \"fit a logistic regression on 50k rows\", so the core\ncomputation takes less than a second. However, the creation of the\nenvironment takes up to a couple of minutes due to the slowness of conda.\n\nThanks for reviewing this, and let me know if you have any further\nquestions.\n\nOn Wed, Sep 1, 2021, 12:40 AM jinzhang21 ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> Thanks for raising the issue, Giacomo.\n>\n> FYI the MLflow community is moving away from conda in favor of Pypi (pip),\n> owing to Anaconda changed its terms of service.
