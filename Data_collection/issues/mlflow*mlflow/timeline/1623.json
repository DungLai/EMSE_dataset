the problem is on the version of tqdm.When i execute the command \" conda  install hyperopt\",got the such reply:\r\n\r\nThe following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\r\n    hyperopt: 0.1.2-py_0   https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge\r\n    tqdm:     4.7.2-py36_0 https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/bioconda\r\nIt's obvious the version of tqdm is  lower .But when i   install hyperopt by pip, it shows \"hyperopt (0.1.2) tqdm (4.32.2) \".Therefore, uninstalling hyperopt re-installed the high version of hyperopt and tdqm via pip to solve the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/513134149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lyw615","id":32604809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjA0ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32604809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615","html_url":"https://github.com/lyw615","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2495046838,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ5NTA0NjgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2495046838","actor":{"login":"lyw615","id":32604809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjA0ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32604809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615","html_url":"https://github.com/lyw615","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyw615/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-19T08:01:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
