This has been a feature on our roadmap for a long time. Ultimately, we are proposing an approach that we consider to be slightly simpler and have described it in an RFC located at https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yHR_xOvoEJQBT-D-y4QGfc3OvHqP-eGWwfMcGBIH2k/edit?usp=sharing. Please check out the doc and leave comments (also see #1129)!
