Here is the gist of it:\r\n\r\nYes, it's possible to have multiple instances of MLflow Tracker Service running behind a load balancer.\r\n\r\nBecause the Tracking server is stateless, you could have multiple instances log to a replicated primary DB as a store. A second hot standby can take over if the primary fails.\r\n\r\nAs for the documentation in how to set up replicated instances of your backend store will vary on which one you elect to use, we cannot definitely document all different scenarios and their configurations.\r\n\r\nI would check the respective documentation of your backend DB and load balancer for how to federate requests to multiple instances of an MLflow tracking server, how to failover to a hot standby or replicated DB, or how to configure a hot-standby replicated DB instance.\r\n\r\nThe short of it: MLflow tracking server is stateless.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/622649278/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3294871473,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI5NDg3MTQ3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3294871473","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-02T01:29:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/990393311","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2760#issuecomment-990393311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2760","id":990393311,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx847CDPf","user":{"login":"ericraymond","id":22483767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDgzNzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22483767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond","html_url":"https://github.com/ericraymond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericraymond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-09T23:20:04Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T23:20:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can the server be run in active/active (load balancer sends request to any of the running instances)?
