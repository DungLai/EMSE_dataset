In our experience, most non toy models are high-dimensional.\r\n\r\n- Forking MLflow to support that will hinder us because we'll have to maintain that fork and very likely have to deal with conflicts pulling in upstream changes.\r\n\r\n- We have assumed we were ignorant and asked around how other products that are MLflow aware deal with high dimensions. We assumed that given that the problem is obvious on any non trivial model, we were surely missing something. We were told that we could solve it with custom functions. Again, we don't want our users to do that, so we'll incur that marginal complexity so they don't have to.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we're developing flavors to support that in a modular way, which is

thanks @jhadjar. Of course you can do that kind of workaround, but you need wrapper like here: [flower_claffifier_example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/flower_classifier)\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable for me to write so much code just to workaround this issue, there should be a better way.
