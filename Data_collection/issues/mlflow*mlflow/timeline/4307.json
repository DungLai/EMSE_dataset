@edwardcqian. Thanks for filing this issue and drafting an implementation.\r\n\r\nPer [CONTRIBUTING.rst](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#write-designs-for-significant-changes):\r\n\r\n`The MLflow REST API is implemented by a variety of open source and proprietary platforms. Changes to the REST API impact all of these platforms. Accordingly, we encourage developers to thoroughly explore alternatives before attempting to introduce REST API changes.`\r\n\r\nIs moving runs between experiments is a common enough workflow to justify introducing a new API?\r\n\r\nI think a good place to start is to write a design document. This should address the above question (eg in a Motivation section), then should discuss API changes, UI changes, client changes, testing, etc. We will need some community support, eg via üëç 's on this issue, as well as consensus on the API changes from various implementers of the MLflow API.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/865452223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4919853412,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDkxOTg1MzQxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4919853412","actor":{"login":"edwardcqian","id":26368837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26368837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian","html_url":"https://github.com/edwardcqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-22T01:26:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4919853415,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5MTk4NTM0MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4919853415","actor":{"login":"edwardcqian","id":26368837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26368837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian","html_url":"https://github.com/edwardcqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwardcqian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-22T01:26:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/943986759","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4307#issuecomment-943986759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4307","id":943986759,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx844RBhH","user":{"login":"jinzhang21","id":78067366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDY3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78067366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21","html_url":"https://github.com/jinzhang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhang21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T04:37:38Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T04:37:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi
