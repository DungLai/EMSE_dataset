Looks similar to [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50472787). One solution is define your `custom_function` in a separate file (say `utils.py`) and import it in your training script like:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> # utils.py\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> def custom_function(df):\r\n>     ...\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> # train.py\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n> \r\n> from utils import custom_function\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This approach worked in my environment.\r\n\r\nThat's great and it worked for my example too! However I am wondering if there is any chance everything could be in the same file.
