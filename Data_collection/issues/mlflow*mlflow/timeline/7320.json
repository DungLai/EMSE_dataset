> When training with fairscale strategy model is wrapped into a different class and hence example_input_array attribute is not present\r\n> \r\n> Is it possible to unwrap the model?\r\n\r\nLooks like `trainer.strategy.lightning_module` returns underlying lightning module. I think a cleaner way of doing model summary is through `on_fit_end` method of a callback where `pl_module` is already available unwrapped alongside `trainer` object. The default `ModelSummary` callback also does that.\r\n\r\nEither approach will prevent the code from breaking and let `patched_fit` proceed to log model where it will break again. I noticed that with strategy `fsdp` model parameter count is shown as 0 in summary which is a pytorch/ lightning problem. Also for strategies `deepspeed_*` it is recommended to use DeepSpeedSummary class instead of ModelSummary, check [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/pytorch_lightning/callbacks/model_summary.html#ModelSummary)\r\n\r\n> > log_model Exception\r\n> \r\n> Sounds like a pytorch's issue. Let us know if you find a workaround for this.\r\n\r\npytorch recommends passing `state_dict` to `torch.save` unlike mlflow's way of passing the `nn.Module` object which will likely contain unserializable properties in any multi-processing context. pytorch lightning recommends using `trainer.save_checkpoint` which further takes care of strategy-specific serialization nuances and works for fairscale already. To some extent, there are callbacks and hooks to patch custom behavior on this serialization method if needed. \r\n\r\nFor loading the model it is necessary to have the class type of the model to use `BoringModel.load_from_checkpoint`. Hopefully, this helps in refactoring the serialization mech in mlflow if that is a viable option.\r\n\r\nA very silly workaround I can think of right now is \r\n```python\r\ncheckpoints = sorted(glob.glob(os.path.join(trainer.default_root_dir, \"lightning_logs/**/*.ckpt\"), recursive=True))\r\nlatest_checkpoint = checkpoints[-1]\r\nreloaded_cpu_model = type(trainer.strategy.lightning_module).load_from_checkpoint(latest_checkpoint, map_location='cpu')\r\nmlflow.pytorch.log_model(reloaded_cpu_model, \"model\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above snippet will be implementable inside patched_fit as well. It assumes model can be loaded on CPU (RAM) entirely. It also shifts the distributed serialization responsibility to pytorch lightning where it is already working. \r\n\r\nFor latest checkpoint I think its possible to inject a ModelCheckpoint callback and use that to reference latest checkpoint / best checkpoint paths in a better way than what I'm doing here.
