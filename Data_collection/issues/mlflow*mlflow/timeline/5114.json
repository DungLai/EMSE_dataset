But, my plan is to create a backend plugin to run the command \"mlflow run URI\" in a kubernetes container upon a pre-built image (e.g.: continuumio/miniconda3:4.10.3). That behavior is different from kubernetes' backend, which builds the image dynamically and runs a command extracted from MLproject's entrypoint. My approach was required because my environment doesn't have Docker to build images dynamically. Besides that, I see an opportunity for runtime optimization by using project's specific pre-built image with the command \"mlflow run URI --no-conda\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/981874362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dinaldoap","id":38653153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjUzMTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38653153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap","html_url":"https://github.com/dinaldoap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinaldoap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5686706525,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx84_f1aMzwAAAAFS9EFd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5686706525","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-29T17:55:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5686706531,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx84_f1aMzwAAAAFS9EFj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5686706531","actor":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-29T17:55:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/982139317","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5114#issuecomment-982139317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5114","id":982139317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx846ikG1","user":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-29T23:54:22Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T23:54:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dinaldoap
