I hope I found the reason for this.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the .dockerignore file is not honored in python docker, when `fileobj` or `custom_context` is passed to `client.images.build`: https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/26d8045ffa99ec402e451cde67415b14b13cc95a/docker/api/build.py#L138-L162\r\n\r\nI don't think docker itself takes care of the build context with the `COPY` command in the dockerfile.\r\n\r\nWhen I understand the mlflow implementation with this custom context correctly, these steps are taken:\r\n1. A hard coded dockerfile is specified on top of the base image\r\n2. A custom build context is build by\r\n    1. copying the whole directory into a temp directory\r\n    2. Adding the specified dockerfile from above\r\n    3. Wrapping everything up into a temp tar file (the custom context)\r\n3. docker build is called with the custom context\r\n\r\nI might miss some hidden functionality of how these contexts are used, but it seems that when specifying a custom context, it is assumed that the .dockerignore or any other relevant aspect for the context is taken care of.\r\n\r\nIdeally the dockerignore would be read before any copying happens, since this seems to heavily slow down everything in case something like a `.venv` is in the work directory","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/669917013/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AdemFr","id":32066272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDY2Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32066272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdemFr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdemFr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/681077113","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2016#issuecomment-681077113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2016","id":681077113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MTA3NzExMw==","user":{"login":"xia-m","id":12322692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzIyNjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12322692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m","html_url":"https://github.com/xia-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xia-m/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-26T19:25:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T20:48:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have encountered the same issue.

Execute `mlflow run .` in the project's root dir and wait for the run to complete.\r\n4.
