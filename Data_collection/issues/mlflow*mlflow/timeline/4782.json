 I have a few ideas for how to solve the issue, but the quick solutions are pretty dirty, and the proper solution would require an API change.\r\n\r\nThe root cause here is that the loaded Tensorflow model is attached to a Python variable in the local scope of the function `_load_tensorflow_saved_model`, and once the interpreter exits that local scope the model is garbage collected and it will be impossible to use the concrete function. The solutions, therefore, rely on making sure that the model is persisted after exiting the scope of `_load_tensorflow_saved_model`. The three options I have considered and partly tested are:\r\n\r\n1. Attach the model as an attribute to the return value of `_load_tensorflow_saved_model`, as suggested in the initial post here. This is the easiest and least disruptive way of solving the issue that I can see now.\r\n2. Use the `nonlocal` keyword to attach the model to an enclosing scope. I have tested this and it works, but it's pretty fragile and might break the API for other use cases.\r\n3. Update the API by wrapping the functions in `mlflow.tensorflow.py` inside of a class, so that the user would do something like `tensorflow_wrapper = mlflow.Tensorflow(); tensorflow_wrapper.load_model()`, and then the model could be stored as a class attribute in `tensorflow_wrapper` and avoid getting garbage collected. This feels like the cleanest solution but would be a pretty big change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/916938887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Chromatius","id":16374386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzc0Mzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16374386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius","html_url":"https://github.com/Chromatius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chromatius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5284772631,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx846_lx0zwAAAAE6_zsX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5284772631","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-10T14:18:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5284772639,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx846_lx0zwAAAAE6_zsf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5284772639","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-10T14:18:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1173046231","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4782#issuecomment-1173046231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4782","id":1173046231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85F60PX","user":{"login":"caozhuozi","id":68834160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODM0MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68834160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi","html_url":"https://github.com/caozhuozi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhuozi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-03T09:29:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-03T09:29:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"encounter
