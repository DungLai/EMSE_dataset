in a broader sense where users are allowed to upload arbitrary content like this, the sequence should typically be something like:\r\n\r\n* Client sets `Content-Type` and uploads the file stream\r\n* Some validation is performed to make sure that user input is correct (a form of input sanitization)\r\n* That upload is stored with that representation and can only be retrieved using a matching client `Accepts` header\r\n\r\nThe server bears some responsibility for verifying that the response matches the request, because otherwise it poses a security issue (i.e. client can upload bad content and then Content-Type hijack to have a client treat content in an unintended way).\r\n\r\nThe way `text/html` is used for everything right now relies on enabling MIME type sniffing in the browser, which is generally not recommended -- see:\r\n* https://www.keycdn.com/support/what-is-mime-sniffing\r\n* https://www.checkbot.io/guide/security/content-sniffing/\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize that might be

@ddl-ebrown\r\n> \r\n> > The server bears some responsibility for verifying that the response matches the request, because otherwise it poses a security issue (i.e. client can upload bad content and

But the complete solution we can't support the existing saved artifacts.\r\n\r\nThanks @ddl-ebrown @WeichenXu123. I think that setting the response content type based on the extension when users download files is a good first step. After the server downloads the file here - https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/ab1aeb7b69e1a050a020c11ad759cb8d7eae3365/mlflow/server/handlers.py#L1469-L1482 - we just need to map its extension to a content type and include it in the response here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/ab1aeb7b69e1a050a020c11ad759cb8d7eae3365/mlflow/server/handlers.py#L1481. This should be a small change. \r\n\r\nI've added the `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` labels. @ddl-ebrown your contribution here would also be greatly appreciated, if
