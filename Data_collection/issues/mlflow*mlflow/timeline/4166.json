formatting of your directory structure examples is not very understandable. I think you may have indentation mistakes which make it difficult to follow.\r\n\r\n> When we try to load the model to tensorflow serving docker there is the following error\r\n\r\nYou don't show how you are actually passing the model location into the Docker container. Are you using `--model_base_path`? If so, maybe you are just making a mistake of setting that as `project_name/1/`, when you should be setting it as more like `project_name/1/tfmodel`? I'm not sure if that's true or not... Maybe you can add an example `docker` command which demonstrates this problem?\r\n\r\nI am guessing that allowing use of arbitrary user-provided `saved_model_dir` subfolder could be risky because it could conflict with subfolders used by other flavors. So it seems like that might not be a great solution. Another way to address this would just be to restructure the model directories before providing them to TF Serving. For example, you could do that by changing the `volumeMount`'s `mountPath`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1065784319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rehevkor5","id":16899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5","html_url":"https://github.com/rehevkor5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehevkor5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
