There are some tricky considerations though - for example, what should the `step`  & `timestamp` values of the metric be? \r\n\r\nOne strawman is that when calling `mlflow.log_metric(key, array_of_values)`, we'd use the current timestamp as the timestamp for all metric values, and assign each metric value a step from 0 to `len(array_of_values)`.\r\n\r\nHowever by default, we display metric values in the UI using the timestamp as the X-axis, so this would cause the curve to appear as a single line (could be solved in the UI by adding special-case logic to use step as the default x axis if all timestamps are the same). We'd also run into issues if people called `mlflow.log_metric(key, array_of_values)` multiple times with the same key (we'd have multiple values for the same step).\r\n\r\nWould be happy to review a proposal that tackles some of these issues (I'd start by investigating what other use cases there are for an `mlflow.log_metric(key, array_of_values)` API) if you've got the time to investigate,

\r\n\r\nIn the proposed workaround, if the number of fpr and tpr change between different trials I will not be possible to compare them properly (not aligned)\r\n\r\nI propose the following workaround. As the thresold, vary between 0 and 1, it will always be possible to compare different trial.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfpr, tpr, thresh = precision_recall_curve(y, scores, pos_label=2)\r\nlist_thresh = np.append(list_thresh, (1, ))  # view precision_recall_curve from sklearn metrics\r\nwith mlflow.start_run():\r\n    for idx in range(len(fpr)):\r\n        seuil = int(round(list_thresh[idx]*10000, 0))  # use high number to avoid several points on the same step\r\n        mlflow.log_metrics({'precision': precision[idx], 'rappel': recall[idx]}, step=seuil)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nActually this workaround works for anything else, as long as the axis x keep the same interval through trials. The only constrainst is to put an integer instead of the step. It would be great to have an additionnal custom field (step / timestamp) to store whatever we want using float. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/901865691/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fulsi","id":17578413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTc4NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17578413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi","html_url":"https://github.com/fulsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fulsi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1144332451","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2451#issuecomment-1144332451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2451","id":1144332451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85ENSCj","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-02T01:49:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T01:49:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"We do not have plans to extend metric logging to arrays at this time, but the example workaround provided by @fulsi is fantastic!
