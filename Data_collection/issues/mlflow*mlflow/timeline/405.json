I would recommend just retrying.\r\n\r\nThe Docker container is going to be a little less forgiving here, since every time you rebuild it will need to redownload everything. I don't use the container personally (didn't even know we had one). Instead, I follow our guide in [CONTRIBUTING.rst](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)), creating a local conda environment and pip installing from there. This will cache already-downloaded dependencies, so even upgrading is more stable/faster.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/417105627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/417106504","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/405#issuecomment-417106504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/405","id":417106504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzEwNjUwNA==","user":{"login":"hamroune","id":795761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune","html_url":"https://github.com/hamroune","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamroune/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T21:08:34Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T21:08:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK.
