Sorry for the delayed response! We don't immediately plan to add this in open-source, but if there is a pluggable way to do this without requiring all implementors of the REST API / all client APIs to add a new parameter, we'd be open to hearing proposals (see the new [feature request template](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request_template.md)).\r\n\r\nBeen a long time, but the 2019 reply seemed open as long as they don't need to add a new parameter to every single api call. That sounds reasonable and means we just need to put our brains together and come up with a way to implement a plugin or wrapper without hacking the core code to bits.
