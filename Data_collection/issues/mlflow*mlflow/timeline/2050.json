Do you have any questions about the API proposal above or how the existing autologging integrations for keras/Tensorflow work?\r\n\r\nI think my preferred of the options for handling pipelines is 2).\r\n\r\nWe should also think about how we handle managing active runs - for example in Keras autologging, we'll automatically start *and* end a run when `keras_model.fit()` is called with no active run, as you can see [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/8bc2749b97c2bb05146ed4820c5320dae4ef593d/mlflow/keras.py#L426). I'm not as sure that the same is the right behavior for scikit-learn, looking at [this example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/plot_isotonic_regression.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-isotonic-regression-py) which calls `fit` or `fit_transform` on multiple estimators in sequence. However maybe it's a reasonable place to start - but would be curious to hear your thoughts

Nice work! I am new to the MLflow community and I am also interested in working on this feature. It seems like we do not need to patch the `get_params` method because we can directly call it on the estimators. \r\n\r\nBut you make a good point that `fit` actually is not defined in the `BaseEstimator` class, but it seems like \"every\" estimator I have seen has a `fit` method. I am not sure whether we can still use patching to get it working. Maybe we can try that on a toy example or please tell me whether you find an estimator that does not have a `fit` method. :)\r\n\r\nThe `get_params` method seems not returning the parameters learned from fitting. So maybe we can just call it once before or after fitting?\r\n\r\nAnd how we deal with `fit` and its cousins `fit_transform` and `fit_predict` still needs further considerations.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I am more than happy to listen to your opinions! @maxconi @smurching

for your comment @Yuchen-Wang-SH !\r\n\r\nI haven't inspected all estimators from sklearn so I'm not sure if they all have the `.fit` method even if it looks like they all have.\r\n\r\nFor forest based models, they inherit their `fit` method from the` BaseForest` class while the `linearRegression` estimator defines its own` fit` method. For the `SVM` estimator, the behavior is defined in `baseLibSVM` class. So even if all estimators seem to have  a `.fit` method it looks that they inherit or define it in a different way. \r\n\r\nDo you know how we could use patching in this case? If we don't use patching, what would be a way to still implement autologging when `.fit` is called on a sklearn model? \r\n\r\nI haven't had the chance yet to look into `fit_transform` & `fir_predict`
