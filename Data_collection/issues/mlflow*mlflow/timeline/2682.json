AFAICT the only way this can happen is if `mkdir` returns `None` [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/v1.3.0/mlflow/store/file_store.py#L205), which only seems possible if `self.root_directory` is `None` in the `FileStore`.

I am able to run your code as long as the name of the experiment is unique.\r\n> Reusing the same name gives the API error you mentioned.\r\n> \r\n> Simple test - in your code, change the name

AFAICT the only way this can happen is if `mkdir` returns `None` [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/v1.3.0/mlflow/store/file_store.py#L205), which only seems possible if `self.root_directory` is `None` in the `FileStore`. Thus I suspect the command in your dockerfile for running the server may not actually be setting the backend store URI of the server properly - are you able to create/view any experiments under your server?\r\n\r\nI am able to view an existent experiment from before (I am using a volume for the \"experiment\" folder which already has a run from before this setup), but I can't create a new one
