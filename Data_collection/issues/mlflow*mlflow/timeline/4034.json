Second, by default, if you are running everything on localhost (or your laptop), the file store is `./mlruns` directory for (MLflow entities) and the artifact repository too.\r\n\r\nIf you have hundreds of unique named experiments with hundreds of runs, and if each run has dozen or more parameters and metrics, each entity is stored under a unique run_id directory, and within that run_id directory, you will have filenames for parameters, metrics, tags, etc. So the UI is naturally is going to be slow over time, because with many directories and files, on a UNIX filesystem, this degrades.\r\n\r\nMLflow on localhost is good for quick experimentation, but if you want to scale, use an SQLAlchemy compatible database. This would be [scenario 4](https://github.com/dmatrix/mlflow-tests/tree/master/py/mlflow/server#scenario-4)\r\n\r\n> Tried to change to sqlite URI on shared filesystem, but this causes artifacts to land in the local folder again (why??).\r\n\r\nYes, as explained in [scenario 2](https://github.com/dmatrix/mlflow-tests/tree/master/py/mlflow/server#scenario-2), artifacts are stored locally under `./mlruns` or whatever `file://shared_path/ you used for artifact store, while all the MLflow entities will be stored in an SQLite database file `mlruns.db`. \r\n\r\nArtifact store is separate from backend entities store; only under [scenario 1 ](https://github.com/dmatrix/mlflow-tests/tree/master/py/mlflow/server#scenario-2)are they share the same filesystem directory.\r\n\r\n> Try to find mlflow.set_artifact_uri() but cannot find one.\r\n\r\nHow do you mean?\r\n\r\n> How do I make mlflow work with a shared filesystem?\r\n\r\nIf your shared filesystem is a remote S3 bucket or supported storage, use scenario 3.\r\n\r\n> How can I store the artifacts in the same folder as the mlflow.db file from sqlite?\r\n\r\nAs I said, the `SQLite://<file_path>/my_sqlite.db` is an SQLite DB file where only MLflow entities (runs, parameters, tags, metadata, etc) are stored, while MLflow artifacts (files, models, etc) are stored in the artifact root directory you specify to the mlflow server as an arugment.\r\n\r\nBy default on a local host without any arguments, all go under the `./mlruns` directory from where you run your file.py (with mlflow client code in it).\r\n\r\nI hope that answers your questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/771362267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4277225321,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI3NzIyNTMyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4277225321","actor":{"login":"Hoeze","id":1200058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDAwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1200058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze","html_url":"https://github.com/Hoeze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-02T05:00:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4277225326,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNzcyMjUzMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4277225326","actor":{"login":"Hoeze","id":1200058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDAwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1200058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze","html_url":"https://github.com/Hoeze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-02T05:00:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4277228086,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQyNzcyMjgwODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4277228086","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-02T05:01:30Z","label":{"name":"needs

The default uri for artefacts when using sqlite is `./mlruns` as specified [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/3aea023d08567b86983e752ac536f65db220c4e9/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/utils.py#L115) as there is no `artifact_uri` passed from the `MlflowClient`'s tracking service [store](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/3aea023d08567b86983e752ac536f65db220c4e9/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py#L40).\r\n\r\nI guess one possible way to solve this could be to pass the `artifact_uri` information to the `mlflow.set_experiment()` along with the `experiment_name` and use it in the [fluent.py](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/3aea023d08567b86983e752ac536f65db220c4e9/mlflow/tracking/fluent.py#L87) wrapper when creating new experiments.\r\n\r\nA hacky way for now would be to go to your `sqlite.db` and update the `artifact_location` on the already created experiments in the `experiements` table (and of course move your `mlruns` folder to the exact same location as specified in the experiment).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/947827017/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhabr","id":25850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr","html_url":"https://github.com/jhabr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhabr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1339765201","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4034#issuecomment-1339765201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4034","id":1339765201,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85P2zHR","user":{"login":"jorgelmadrid","id":47125290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTI1Mjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47125290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgelmadrid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelmadrid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T18:02:39Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T18:02:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Here's my solution\r\n\r\n1.
