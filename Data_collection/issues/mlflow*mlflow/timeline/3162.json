@KarishmaDaga.  In the original PR we agreed with mlflow core developers to use the backend_config to pass this argument. The local backend will be good example for the AzureML plugin you are developing. The PR is still in review but you can have a look on how I get this information: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3124/files#diff-093ff776ec235c7cdf333d81948e87f0R50\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the conda methods are also moved into a separate module in mlflow. You can rely on it to create your environment. Another alternative is to use https://github.com/criteo/cluster-pack that would ship your python environment in a distributed environment.\r\n\r\nDoes it fit your need ?
