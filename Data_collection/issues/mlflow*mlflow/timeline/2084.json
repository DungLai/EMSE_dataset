important part because it allows the UI to be fast, which is crucial.\r\n\r\nFor the ui : \r\nI did not implement nested run yet, I can add it but I have a few questions : \r\n* what is the use case of this feature : why wouldn't users compare runs between \"master runs\" ?\r\n* how should it work UX wise ? for example what should happen in kind of sorting, which runs get displayed first ? (current behavior is to sort regardless of nesting which is not intuitive)\r\n\r\nThe reason why I chose react table is because it already implements : \r\n* ordering by clicking on the column names (and even multiple column ordering)\r\n* filtering on top of each columns\r\n* pagination (page count, page numbering, selection of numbers of runs by page)\r\n* calling the API when doing ordering, filtering, ...\r\nWheras I would have to reimplement all of this if using ReactVirtualized\r\n\r\nSo I think it has more features out of the box.\r\n\r\nI will soon publish a PR for the ui, I hope that will make things clearer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/554995167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2807758620,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4MDc3NTg2MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2807758620","actor":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6fb9443c0f66d34b3598ceb4ad94574d11482599","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/criteo-forks/mlflow/commits/6fb9443c0f66d34b3598ceb4ad94574d11482599","created_at":"2019-11-18T14:39:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/555044825","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2084#issuecomment-555044825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2084","id":555044825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTA0NDgyNQ==","user":{"login":"rom1504","id":2346494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504","html_url":"https://github.com/rom1504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rom1504/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-18T14:43:23Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T14:43:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's the second pull request, to add the total run count in backend https://github.com/criteo-forks/mlflow/pull/43 ; important to implement pagination in UI.

@rom1504: Yes. The concern is with changing the API--specifically adding a separate `total_run_count` field in `SearchRuns.Response`. I am not sure how you intend on building the UI component described here and if that will **require** returned response to have this `total_run_count` value. Lemme clarify.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if got a chance to look through the document I attached with my previous comment. We have deliberately tried to keep the token response as a generic string rather than a structured field. This gives the backend and frontend to have an opaque implementation for pagination. For instance, current open source pagination is an offset and limit based implementation -- where `offset` is returned in the json string. Another backend may choose to have a more detailed [cursor based approach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ygti9oyMbi4DJNbaM0D49nNIKb8BLXwGYQ7WmrOKJ3s/edit?usp=sharing#heading=h.76z02dr2xfy6) for implementing pagination. In the case of the latter, it may be difficult to know what is the exact # of runs that qualify the original search criteria (depending on how the backend is implemented). As I mentioned, the original design for `SearchRuns` with pagination API was such that it was open to any implementation of UI and backend.\r\n\r\nI fact #2059 achieves this for SQL backend by pushing pagination down to SQL layer for efficiencies and total # of runs is no longer available. To get this additional information, it would be necessary to do an additional `COUNT` query with the same filter and no pagination to achieve total row count.\r\n\r\nOne way of doing this would be \r\n1. Leave it to individual backend developers if they want to add total run count. If so, the token can have an optional `\"total_run_count\"` field. Add this to the dictionary before encoding the token. Some backends like `FileStore` will be able to implement that while `SqlAlchemyStore` and `RestStore` may choose to not implement that.\r\n2. UI: add an optional component for optional component for `total_run_count` field. If present it will show the field else will skip \"of ...\" in the display. Before implementing UI components please have @Zangr and @gioa approve design for UI.\r\n\r\nAnother note: Other MLflow developers that have created their own backend and UI implementations conformant to MLflow API have used `plugin` implementation to inject backend implementation.

It is an interesting idea, but I wonder what is the use case for fetching column names. Depending on the # of runs in list of requested experiments this column list might be very large. Some of the experiments we have seen have 100K+ runs and collecting **all** the distinct column names for metrics, params, attributes, and tags for qualifying experiments could be prohibitively expensive. Especially, if the runs use different ML algorithms records lots of unique params and metrics, these lists could be extremely large. This also adds new API surface that would need to be implemented in all backends.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use case for knowing **all** metric, param, tag, and attribute keys for all runs in an experiment or set of experiments. Have you considered other design choices for this--for instance one of the options for the UI shown in the picture above, could be for these column lists be dynamically deduced in the UI from the data in runs returned, rather than adding a whole new API. With pagination, you will only have a subset of column names which can be reduced in the UI and kept in cache (which you might have to anyways if using a different API). As new pages are pulled from backend, this cache could be kept active.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder: before implementing UI components please have @Zangr and @gioa approve design for UI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/555667560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2812682264,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgxMjY4MjI2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2812682264","actor":{"login":"gioa","id":1960721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjA3MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1960721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa","html_url":"https://github.com/gioa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-19T19:21:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
