I wanted to use run nesting to reflect the latter two runs' dependence on the artifact produced in the previous step.\r\n\r\nFor example, I first run the data prep job with some set of parameters, and it produces an artifact (the training data). Some time later, I run the training job. This job re-starts the data prep run and uses `mlflow.get_artifact_uri` to load the training data artifact. Then it starts a nested run for training and logs all the model parameters and the model artifact it produces. The scoring job would do something similar, nested under the training job.\r\n\r\nThis is arguably a hack since training isn't really a part of data prep (and the fact that it unsets the parent's end time is a drawback), but it seemed like a nice way to group all runs derived from a given dataset together in the UI. The problem is that I wanted one more level, and I didn't realize the nesting was capped at 2 until I had built out the pipeline and run it.\r\n\r\nDue to the UI limitation I ended up removing the nesting. I use MlflowClient to query the previous step's artifact instead of using `mlflow.get_artifact_uri`. I also log the previous step's run_id as a tag or parameter of the active run so that I can filter by it later. This requires me to copy/paste run ids into the filter box, which is not as nice as clicking a disclosure toggle in the UI, but works ok.\r\n\r\nNot a blocker by any means, but wanted to share my use case for reference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/588516415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"baldwint","id":1120261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1120261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint","html_url":"https://github.com/baldwint","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwint/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/588720684","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2414#issuecomment-588720684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2414","id":588720684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODcyMDY4NA==","user":{"login":"MFreidank","id":6368040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjgwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6368040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank","html_url":"https://github.com/MFreidank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MFreidank/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-20T08:02:01Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T08:02:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 Many situations were multi-level nesting is useful, including training ensemble models and hyperparameter tuning.
