See [this comment](https://github.com/databricks/mlflow/issues/158#issuecomment-405410204) for more info.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this for now is:\r\n* Create an experiment against your tracking server with an artifact root of `/mlruns` - you can to SSH into the tracking server & run `mlflow experiments create --artifact-root /mlruns [experiment-name]`, or call the Python `mlflow.create_experiment` API after running `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(<your_server_uri>)`.\r\n* Run your code snippet above (with the ID of the newly-created experiment), being sure to call `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(<your_server_uri>)` beforehand. The created run should get its artifact URI from the experiment, which should now have the desired artifact root.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/405718312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1738662252,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTczODY2MjI1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1738662252","actor":{"login":"samuel100","id":9161628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjE2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9161628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100","html_url":"https://github.com/samuel100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-17T20:33:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1738662253,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3Mzg2NjIyNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1738662253","actor":{"login":"samuel100","id":9161628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjE2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9161628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100","html_url":"https://github.com/samuel100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-17T20:33:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/405929254","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/163#issuecomment-405929254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/163","id":405929254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTkyOTI1NA==","user":{"login":"samuel100","id":9161628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjE2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9161628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100","html_url":"https://github.com/samuel100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuel100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-18T13:24:13Z","updated_at":"2018-07-18T13:24:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
