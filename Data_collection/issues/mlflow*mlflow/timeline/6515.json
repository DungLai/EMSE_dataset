Yes, I am sure. I reran the minimal example you provided and indeed, if the run terminates properly the assertion fails. This is because the artifact URI (when, e.g., deleting the `mlruns/` folder in the current directory and \"starting from scratch\") is then `file:///home/localuser/dev/mlruns/0/b59819c7deb14880b7168f91f857f224/artifacts` for example, instead of `file:///workspace/mlruns/0/ea5634b7b072420f89415601b091189d/artifacts` which happens when the previous run was not correctly terminated.\r\n2. Yes, I log dictionaries, more generic artifacts (custom images, json files, h5 files, ...)\r\n3. No, it does not in general and the local user has (correctly) no clearance to write to `/workspace/` (as it has no permission to write to `/` since that would presumably come with admin rights...)\r\n4. I don't need to use `/workspace` but as I specified earlier -- I am not setting it anywhere explicitly! This is somehow set automatically as default, I don't actively/knowingly/intentionally set this anywhere! My `mlruns/` folder is normally in the directory where I launch my training script -- where I have all rights I need. But somehow in some pathological cases MLflow is trying to write to
