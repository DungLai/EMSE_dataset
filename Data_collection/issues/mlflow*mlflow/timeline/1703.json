I have the same issue but I believe that is because I'm setting the tracking server URI inside the python code instead of the environment variable.\r\n> \r\n> I'm setup my MLproject to use docker, and when I run the project using `mlflow run` command that excecute the docker run command passing MLFLOW_TRACKING_SERVER env variable using as value my local environment value. And then creates the run_id. But the run_id is generated using the MLFLOW_TRACKING_SERVER at the moment of the execution of the docker run command, not using the MLFLOW_TRACKING_SERVER that I setup inside my code.\r\n> \r\n> There is any way to pass the MLFLOW_TRACKING_SERVER to the docker run comment with setting it as a local environment value?\r\n\r\nHi @carlos-rodrigo, if you are still facing this issue, it would be
