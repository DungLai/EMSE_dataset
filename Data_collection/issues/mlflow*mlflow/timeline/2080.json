Can you give an example of what you mean by `submodule`? Do you mean entry points or like a directory structure with multiple `MLproject` files.\r\n\r\nAn MLflow Project is simple directly that as `MLproject` file and other stuff which is an organization of environment, code, data, etc to be able to reproduce a machine learning run. [MLproject File](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#mlproject-file) section in the documentation shows 2 entry points `main` and `validate`. Each of these details out parameters and the underlying command to run. When running an MLflow project a user has to specify the entry point to run and any parameters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/553218368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2793750277,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc5Mzc1MDI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2793750277","actor":{"login":"damejovanoski","id":56073337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDczMzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56073337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski","html_url":"https://github.com/damejovanoski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T03:10:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2793750279,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3OTM3NTAyNzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2793750279","actor":{"login":"damejovanoski","id":56073337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDczMzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56073337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski","html_url":"https://github.com/damejovanoski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damejovanoski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T03:10:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/558734813","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2080#issuecomment-558734813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2080","id":558734813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODczNDgxMw==","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T17:25:45Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T17:25:45Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@mparkhe
