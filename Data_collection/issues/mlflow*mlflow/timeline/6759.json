MLflow. This page provides useful\r\ninformation about contributing to MLflow.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"contents\" data-local=\"\" data-depth=\"4\">\r\n\r\n**Table of Contents**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n\r\nGovernance of MLflow is conducted by the Technical Steering Committee\r\n(TSC), which currently includes the following members:\r\n\r\n>   - Patrick Wendell (<pwendell@gmail.com>)\r\n>   - Reynold Xin (<reynoldx@gmail.com>)\r\n>   - Matei Zaharia (<matei@cs.stanford.edu>)\r\n\r\nThe founding technical charter can be found\r\n[here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow-charter.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Contribution process\r\n\r\nThe MLflow contribution process starts with filing a GitHub issue.\r\nMLflow defines four categories of issues: feature requests, bug reports,\r\ndocumentation fixes, and installation issues. Details about each issue\r\ntype and the issue lifecycle are discussed in the [MLflow Issue\r\nPolicy](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md).\r\n\r\nMLflow committers actively [triage](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst) and respond to\r\nGitHub issues. In general, we recommend waiting for feedback from an\r\nMLflow committer or community member before proceeding to implement a\r\nfeature or patch. This is particularly important for [significant\r\nchanges](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#write-designs-for-significant-changes),\r\nand will typically be labeled during triage with `needs design`.\r\n\r\nAfter you have agreed upon an implementation strategy for your feature\r\nor patch with an MLflow committer, the next step is to introduce your\r\nchanges (see [developing\r\nchanges](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#developing-and-testing-mlflow))\r\nas a pull request against the MLflow Repository (we recommend pull\r\nrequests be filed from a non-master branch on a repository fork) or as a\r\nstandalone MLflow Plugin. MLflow committers actively review pull\r\nrequests and are also happy to provide implementation guidance for\r\nPlugins.\r\n\r\nOnce your pull request against the MLflow Repository has been merged,\r\nyour corresponding changes will be automatically included in the next\r\nMLflow release. Every change is listed in the MLflow release notes and\r\n[Changelog](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you have just contributed to MLflow. We appreciate your\r\ncontribution\\!\r\n\r\n## Contribution guidelines\r\n\r\nIn this section, we provide guidelines to consider as you develop new\r\nfeatures and patches for MLflow.\r\n\r\n### Write designs for significant changes\r\n\r\nFor significant changes to MLflow, we recommend outlining a design for\r\nthe feature or patch and discussing it with an MLflow committer before\r\ninvesting heavily in implementation. During issue triage, we try to\r\nproactively identify issues require design by labeling them with `needs\r\ndesign`. This is particularly important if your proposed implementation:\r\n\r\n  - Introduces changes or additions to the [MLflow REST\r\n    API](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html)\r\n      - The MLflow REST API is implemented by a variety of open source\r\n        and proprietary platforms. Changes to the REST API impact all of\r\n        these platforms. Accordingly, we encourage developers to\r\n        thoroughly explore alternatives before attempting to introduce\r\n        REST API changes.\r\n  - Introduces new user-facing MLflow APIs\r\n      - MLflow's API surface is carefully designed to generalize across\r\n        a variety of common ML operations. It is important to ensure\r\n        that new APIs are broadly useful to ML developers, easy to work\r\n        with, and simple yet powerful.\r\n  - Adds new library dependencies to MLflow\r\n  - Makes changes to critical internal abstractions. Examples include:\r\n    the Tracking Artifact Repository, the Tracking Abstract Store, and\r\n    the Model Registry Abstract Store.\r\n\r\n### Make changes backwards compatible\r\n\r\nMLflow's users rely on specific platform and API behaviors in their\r\ndaily workflows. As new versions of MLflow are developed and released,\r\nit is important to ensure that users' workflows continue to operate as\r\nexpected. Accordingly, please take care to consider backwards\r\ncompatibility when introducing changes to the MLflow code base. If you\r\nare unsure of the backwards compatibility implications of a particular\r\nchange, feel free to ask an MLflow committer or community member for\r\ninput.\r\n\r\n### Consider introducing new features as MLflow Plugins\r\n\r\n[MLflow Plugins](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html) enable\r\nintegration of third-party modules with many of MLflow’s components,\r\nallowing you to maintain and iterate on certain features independently\r\nof the MLflow Repository. Before implementing changes to the MLflow code\r\nbase, consider whether your feature might be better structured as an\r\nMLflow Plugin. MLflow Plugins are a great choice for the following types\r\nof changes:\r\n\r\n1.  Supporting a new storage platform for MLflow artifacts\r\n2.  Introducing a new implementation of the MLflow Tracking backend\r\n    ([Abstract\r\n    Store](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cdc6a651d5af0f29bd448d2c87a198cf5d32792b/mlflow/store/tracking/abstract_store.py))\r\n    for a particular platform\r\n3.  Introducing a new implementation of the Model Registry backend\r\n    ([Abstract\r\n    Store](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cdc6a651d5af0f29bd448d2c87a198cf5d32792b/mlflow/store/model_registry/abstract_store.py))\r\n    for a particular platform\r\n4.  Automatically capturing and recording information about MLflow Runs\r\n    created in specific environments\r\n\r\nMLflow committers and community members are happy to provide assistance\r\nwith the development and review of new MLflow Plugins.\r\n\r\nFinally, MLflow maintains a list of Plugins developed by community\r\nmembers, which is located at\r\n<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html#community-plugins>. This is\r\nan excellent way to inform MLflow users about your exciting new Plugins.\r\nTo list your plugin, simply introduce a new pull request against the\r\n[corresponding docs section of the MLflow code\r\nbase](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cdc6a651d5af0f29bd448d2c87a198cf5d32792b/docs/source/plugins.rst#community-plugins).\r\n\r\nFor more information about Plugins, see\r\n<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html>.\r\n\r\n## Setting up the repository\r\n\r\nTo set up the MLflow repository, run the following commands:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n# Clone the repository\r\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<username>/mlflow.git\r\n# The alternative way of cloning through https may cause permission error during branch push\r\n# git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<username>/mlflow.git\r\n\r\n# Add the upstream repository\r\ncd mlflow\r\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you cloned the repository before without `--recurse-submodules`, run\r\nthis command to fetch submodules:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Developing and testing MLflow\r\n\r\nThe majority of the MLflow codebase is developed in Python. This\r\nincludes the CLI, Tracking Server, Artifact Repositories (e.g., S3 or\r\nAzure Blob Storage backends), and of course the Python fluent, tracking,\r\nand model APIs.\r\n\r\n### Environment Setup and Python configuration\r\n\r\nHaving a standardized development environment is advisable when working\r\non MLflow. Creating an environment that contains the required Python\r\npackages (and versions), linting tools, and environment configurations\r\nwill help to prevent unnecessary CI failures when filing a PR. A\r\ncorrectly configured local environment will also allow you to run tests\r\nlocally in an environment that mimics that of the CI execution\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nThere are two means of setting up a base Python development environment\r\nfor MLflow: automated (through the\r\n[dev-env-setup.sh](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/dev/dev-env-setup.sh)\r\nscript) or manual. Even in a manual-based approach (i.e., testing\r\nfunctionality of a specific version of a model flavor's package\r\nversion), the automated script can save a great deal of time and reduce\r\nerrors in creating the environment.\r\n\r\n#### Automated Python development environment configuration\r\n\r\nThe automated development environment setup script\r\n([dev-env-setup.sh](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/dev/dev-env-setup.sh))\r\ncan be used to setup a development environment that is configured with\r\nall of the dependencies required and the environment configuration\r\nneeded to develop and locally test the Python code portions of MLflow.\r\nThis CLI tool's readme can be accessed via the root of the mlflow\r\nrepository as follows:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ndev/dev-env-setup.sh -h\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example usage of this script that will build a development\r\nenvironment using `virtualenv` and the minimum supported Python version\r\n(to ensure compatibility) is:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ndev/dev-env-setup.sh -d .venvs/mlflow-dev -q\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `-q` parameter is to \"quiet\" the pip install processes preventing\r\nstdout printing during installation.\r\n\r\nIt is advised to follow all of the prompts to ensure that the\r\nconfiguration of the environment, as well as git, are completed so that\r\nyour PR process is as effortless as possible.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"note\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFrequently, a specific version of a library is required in order to\r\nvalidate a feature's compatibility with older versions. Modifying your\r\nprimary development environment to test one-off compatibility can be\r\nvery error-prone and result in an environment that is significantly\r\ndifferent from that of the CI test environment. To support this use\r\ncase, the automated script can be used to create an environment that can\r\nbe easily modified to support testing a particular version of a model\r\nflavor in an isolated environment. Simply run the `dev-env-setup.sh`\r\nscript, activate the new environment, and install the required version\r\nfor testing.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nExample of installing an older version of `scikit-learn` to perform\r\nisolated testing:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ndev/dev-env-setup.sh -d ~/.venvs/sklearn-test -q\r\nsource ~/.venvs/sklearn-test/bin/activate\r\npip freeze | grep \"scikit-learn\"\r\n>> scikit-learn==1.0.2\r\npip install scikit-learn==1.0.1\r\npip freeze | grep \"scikit-learn\"\r\n>> scikit-learn==1.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Manual Python development environment configuration\r\n\r\nThe manual process is recommended if you are going to use Conda or if\r\nyou are fond of terminal setup processes. To start with the manual\r\nprocess, ensure that you have either conda or virtualenv installed.\r\n\r\nFirst, ensure that your name and email are [configured in\r\ngit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)\r\nso that you can [sign your work](#sign-your-work) when committing code\r\nchanges and opening pull requests:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\r\ngit config --global user.email yourname@example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor convenience, we provide a pre-commit git hook that validates that\r\ncommits are signed-off and runs <span class=\"title-ref\">black\r\n--check</span> and <span class=\"title-ref\">pylint</span> to ensure the\r\ncode will pass the lint check for python. You can enable it by running:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ngit config core.hooksPath hooks\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, install the Python MLflow package from source - this is required\r\nfor developing & testing changes across all languages and APIs. We\r\nrecommend installing MLflow in its own conda environment by running the\r\nfollowing from your checkout of MLflow:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nconda create --name mlflow-dev-env python=3.7\r\nconda activate mlflow-dev-env\r\npip install -e '.[extras]' # installs mlflow from current checkout with some useful extra utilities\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you plan on doing development and testing, you will also need to\r\ninstall the following into the conda environment:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\npip install -r requirements/dev-requirements.txt\r\npip install -e '.[extras]'  # installs mlflow from current checkout\r\npip install -e tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin # installs `mlflow-test-plugin` that is required for running certain MLflow tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may need to run `conda install cmake` for the test requirements to\r\nproperly install, as `onnx` needs `cmake`.\r\n\r\nEnsure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed.\r\n\r\nFinally, we use `pytest` to test all Python contributed code. Install\r\n`pytest`:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\npip install pytest\r\n```\r\n\r\n### JavaScript and UI\r\n\r\nThe MLflow UI is written in JavaScript. `yarn` is required to run the\r\nJavascript dev server and the tracking UI. You can verify that `yarn` is\r\non the PATH by running `yarn -v`, and [install\r\nyarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) if needed.\r\n\r\n#### Install Node Module Dependencies\r\n\r\nOn OSX, install the following packages required by the node modules:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nbrew install pixman cairo pango jpeg\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinux/Windows users will need to source these dependencies using the\r\nappropriate package manager on their platforms.\r\n\r\n#### Install Node Modules\r\n\r\nBefore running the Javascript dev server or building a distributable\r\nwheel, install Javascript dependencies via:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd mlflow/server/js\r\nyarn install\r\ncd - # return to root repository directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf modifying dependencies in `mlflow/server/js/package.json`, run `yarn\r\nupgrade` within `mlflow/server/js` to install the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Launching the Development UI\r\n\r\nWe recommend [Running the Javascript Dev\r\nServer](#running-the-javascript-dev-server) - otherwise, the tracking\r\nfrontend will request files in the `mlflow/server/js/build` directory,\r\nwhich is not checked into Git. Alternatively, you can generate the\r\nnecessary files in `mlflow/server/js/build` as described in [Building a\r\nDistributable Artifact](#building-a-distributable-artifact).\r\n\r\n#### Running the Javascript Dev Server\r\n\r\n[Install Node Modules](#install-node-modules), then run the following:\r\n\r\nIn one shell:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nmlflow ui\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn another shell:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd mlflow/server/js\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Javascript Dev Server will run at <http://localhost:3000> and the\r\nMLflow server will run at <http://localhost:5000> and show runs logged\r\nin `./mlruns`.\r\n\r\n#### Testing a React Component\r\n\r\nAdd a test file in the same directory as the newly created React\r\ncomponent. For example, `CompareRunBox.test.js` should be added in the\r\nsame directory as `CompareRunBox.js`. Next, in `mlflow/server/js`, run\r\nthe following command to start the test.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n# Run tests in CompareRunBox.test.js\r\nyarn test CompareRunBox.test.js\r\n# Run tests with a name that matches 'plot' in CompareRunBox.test.js\r\nyarn test CompareRunBox.test.js -t 'plot'\r\n# Run all tests\r\nyarn test\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Linting Javascript Code\r\n\r\nIn `mlflow/server/js`, run the following command to lint your code.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n# Note this command only fixes auto-fixable issues (e.g. remove trailing whitespace)\r\nyarn lint:fix\r\n```\r\n\r\n### R\r\n\r\nIf contributing to MLflow's R APIs, install\r\n[R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and make sure that you have satisfied\r\nall the [Common prerequisites and dependencies]().\r\n\r\nFor changes to R documentation, also install\r\n[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) 2.2.1 or above, verifying\r\nthe version of your installation via `pandoc --version`. If using Mac\r\nOSX, note that the homebrew installation of pandoc may be out of date -\r\nyou can find newer pandoc versions at\r\n<https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases>.\r\n\r\nThe `mlflow/R/mlflow` directory contains R wrappers for the Projects,\r\nTracking and Models components. These wrappers depend on the Python\r\npackage, so first install the Python package in a conda environment:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n# Note that we don't pass the -e flag to pip, as the R tests attempt to run the MLflow UI\r\n# via the CLI, which will not work if we run against the development tracking server\r\npip install .\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), then run the following to\r\ninstall dependencies for building MLflow locally:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd mlflow/R/mlflow\r\nNOT_CRAN=true Rscript -e 'install.packages(\"devtools\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")'\r\nNOT_CRAN=true Rscript -e 'devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild the R client via:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nR CMD build .\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun tests:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nR CMD check --no-build-vignettes --no-manual --no-tests mlflow*tar.gz\r\ncd tests\r\nNOT_CRAN=true LINTR_COMMENT_BOT=false Rscript ../.run-tests.R\r\ncd -\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun linter:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nRscript -e 'lintr::lint_package()'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf opening a PR that makes API changes, please regenerate API\r\ndocumentation as described in [Writing Docs](#writing-docs) and commit\r\nthe updated docs to your PR branch.\r\n\r\nWhen developing, you can make Python changes available in R by running\r\n(from mlflow/R/mlflow):\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nRscript -e 'reticulate::conda_install(\"r-mlflow\", \"../../../.\", pip = TRUE)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease also follow the recommendations from the [Advanced R - Style\r\nGuide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) regarding naming and styling.\r\n\r\n### Java\r\n\r\nIf contributing to MLflow's Java APIs or modifying Java documentation,\r\ninstall [Java](https://www.java.com/) and [Apache\r\nMaven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).\r\n\r\nCertain MLflow modules are implemented in Java, under the `mlflow/java/`\r\ndirectory. These are the Java Tracking API client (`mlflow/java/client`)\r\nand the Model Scoring Server for Java-based models like MLeap\r\n(`mlflow/java/scoring`).\r\n\r\nOther Java functionality (like artifact storage) depends on the Python\r\npackage, so first install the Python package in a conda environment as\r\ndescribed in [Common prerequisites and dependencies]().\r\n[Install](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\r\nthe Java 8 JDK (or above), and\r\n[download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and\r\n[install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) Maven. You can then\r\nbuild and run tests via:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd mlflow/java\r\nmvn compile test\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf opening a PR that makes API changes, please regenerate API\r\ndocumentation as described in [Writing Docs](#writing-docs) and commit\r\nthe updated docs to your PR branch.\r\n\r\n### Python\r\n\r\nIf you are contributing in Python, make sure that you have satisfied all\r\nthe [Common prerequisites and dependencies](), including installing\r\n`pytest`, as you will need it for the sections described below.\r\n\r\n#### Writing Python Tests\r\n\r\nIf your PR includes code that isn't currently covered by our tests (e.g.\r\nadding a new flavor, adding autolog support to a flavor, etc.), you\r\nshould write tests that cover your new code. Your tests should be added\r\nto the relevant file under `tests`, or if there is no appropriate file,\r\nin a new file prefixed with `test_` so that `pytest` includes that file\r\nfor testing.\r\n\r\nIf your tests require usage of a tracking URI, the [pytest\r\nfixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/3.2.1/fixture.html)\r\n[tracking\\_uri\\_mock](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/tests/conftest.py#L74)\r\nis automatically set up for every tests. It sets up a mock tracking URI\r\nthat will set itself up before your test runs and tear itself down\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nBy default, runs are logged under a local temporary directory that's\r\nunique to each test and torn down immediately after test execution. To\r\ndisable this behavior, decorate your test function with\r\n`@pytest.mark.notrackingurimock`\r\n\r\n#### Running Python Tests\r\n\r\nVerify that the unit tests & linter pass before submitting a pull\r\nrequest by running:\r\n\r\nWe use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to ensure a\r\nconsistent code format. You can auto-format your code by running:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nblack .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, verify that the unit tests & linter pass before submitting a pull\r\nrequest by running:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n./dev/lint.sh\r\n./dev/run-python-tests.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) to run\r\nPython tests. You can run tests for one or more test directories or\r\nfiles via `pytest [file_or_dir] ... [file_or_dir]`. For example, to run\r\nall pyfunc tests, you can run:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\npytest tests/pyfunc\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Certain model tests are not well-isolated (can result in OOMs when\r\nrun in the same Python process), so simply invoking `pytest` or `pytest\r\ntests` may not work. If you'd like to run multiple model tests, we\r\nrecommend doing so via separate `pytest` invocations, e.g. `pytest\r\ntests/sklearn && pytest tests/tensorflow`\r\n\r\nIf opening a PR that changes or adds new APIs, please update or add\r\nPython documentation as described in [Writing Docs](#writing-docs) and\r\ncommit the docs to your PR branch.\r\n\r\n#### Python Client\r\n\r\nFor the client, if you are adding new model flavors, follow the\r\ninstructions below.\r\n\r\n##### Python Model Flavors\r\n\r\nIf you are adding new framework flavor support, you'll need to modify\r\n`pytest` and Github action configurations so tests for your code can run\r\nproperly. Generally, the files you'll have to edit are:\r\n\r\n1.  `dev/run-python-tests.sh`:\r\n\r\n> 1.  Add your tests to the ignore list, where the other frameworks are\r\n>     ignored\r\n> 2.  Add a pytest command for your tests along with the other framework\r\n>     tests (as a separate command to avoid OOM issues)\r\n\r\n2.  `requirements/test-requirements.txt`: add your framework and version\r\n    to the list of requirements\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of a [flavor\r\nPR](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2136/files).\r\n\r\n#### Python Server\r\n\r\nFor the Python server, you can contribute in these two areas described\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n##### Building Protobuf Files\r\n\r\nTo build protobuf files, simply run `generate-protos.sh`. The required\r\n`protoc` version is `3.6.0`. You can find the URL of a\r\nsystem-appropriate installation of `protoc` at\r\n<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.6.0>, e.g.\r\n<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.6.0/protoc-3.6.0-osx-x86_64.zip>\r\nif you're on 64-bit Mac OSX.\r\n\r\nThen, run the following to install `protoc`:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n# Update PROTOC_ZIP if on a platform other than 64-bit Mac OSX\r\nPROTOC_ZIP=protoc-3.19.4-osx-x86_64.zip\r\ncurl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.19.4/$PROTOC_ZIP\r\nsudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc\r\nsudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*'\r\nrm -f $PROTOC_ZIP\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can build protobuf files using Docker:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\npushd dev\r\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t gen-protos -f Dockerfile.protos .\r\npopd\r\ndocker run --rm \\\r\n  -v $(pwd)/mlflow/protos:/app/mlflow/protos \\\r\n  -v $(pwd)/mlflow/java/client/src/main/java:/app/mlflow/java/client/src/main/java \\\r\n  -v $(pwd)/generate-protos.sh:/app/generate-protos.sh \\\r\n  gen-protos ./generate-protos.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify that .proto files and autogenerated code are in sync by running\r\n`./dev/test-generate-protos.sh.`\r\n\r\n##### Database Schema Changes\r\n\r\nMLflow's Tracking component supports storing experiment and run data in\r\na SQL backend. To make changes to the tracking database schema, run the\r\nfollowing from your checkout of MLflow:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n# starting at the root of the project\r\n$ pwd\r\n~/mlflow\r\n$ cd mlflow\r\n# MLflow relies on Alembic (https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org) for schema migrations.\r\n$ alembic -c mlflow/store/db_migrations/alembic.ini revision -m \"add new field to db\"\r\n  Generating ~/mlflow/mlflow/store/db_migrations/versions/b446d3984cfa_add_new_field_to_db.py\r\n# Update schema files\r\n$ ./tests/db/update_schemas.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese commands generate a new migration script (e.g., at\r\n`~/mlflow/mlflow/alembic/versions/12341123_add_new_field_to_db.py`) that\r\nyou should then edit to add migration logic.\r\n\r\nDeveloping inside a Docker container (experimental)\r\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\r\n\r\nInstead of setting up local or virtual environment, it's possible to\r\nwrite code and tests inside a Docker container that will contain an\r\nisolated Python environment setup inside. It's possible to build and run\r\npreconfigured image, then attach with the compatible code editor (e.g.\r\nVSCode) into a running container. This helps avoiding issues with local\r\nsetup, e.g. on CPU architectures that are not yet fully compatible with\r\nall dependency packages (e.g. Apple arm64 architecture).\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n  - Docker runtime installed on a local machine\r\n    (<https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>)\r\n  - Code editor compatible capable of running inside containers\r\n      - Example: VSCode (<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>) with\r\n        Remote Containers extension\r\n        (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers>)\r\n\r\n#### Setup\r\n\r\nRun the following command:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ndev/run-test-container.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will need to wait until the docker daemon will complete building the\r\ndocker image. After successful build, the container will be\r\nautomatically run with `mlflow-test` name. A new shell session running\r\nin container's context will start in the terminal window, do not close\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow you can attach to the running container with your code editor.\r\n\r\n  - Instructions for VSCode:\r\n    \r\n      - invoke the command palette (`[Ctrl/CMD]+Shift+P`)\r\n      - find \"Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container...\" option,\r\n        confirm with `Enter` key\r\n      - find the \"mlflow-test\" container, confirm with `Enter` key\r\n      - a new code editor should appear running inside the context of\r\n        Docker container\r\n      - you can now freely change source code and corresponding tests,\r\n        the changes will be reflected on your machine filesystem\r\n      - to run code or tests inside container, you can open a terminal\r\n        with `[Ctrl/CMD]+Shift+`<span class=\"title-ref\"> and run any\r\n        command which will be executed inside container, e.g.\r\n        </span><span class=\"title-ref\">pytest\r\n        tests/test\\_version.py</span>\\`\r\n\r\nAfter typing `exit` in the terminal window that executed\r\n`dev/run-test-container.sh`, the container will be shut down and\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n### Writing MLflow Examples\r\n\r\nThe `mlflow/examples` directory has a collection of quickstart tutorials\r\nand various simple examples that depict MLflow tracking, project, model\r\nflavors, model registry, and serving use cases. These examples provide\r\ndevelopers sample code, as a quick way to learn MLflow Python APIs.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate review, strive for brief examples that reflect real user\r\nworkflows, document how to run your example, and follow the recommended\r\nsteps below.\r\n\r\nIf you are contributing a new model flavor, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1.  Follow instructions in [Python Model Flavors](#python-model-flavors)\r\n2.  Create a corresponding directory in\r\n    `mlflow/examples/new-model-flavor`\r\n3.  Implement your Python training `new-model-flavor` code in this\r\n    directory\r\n4.  Convert this directory’s content into an [MLflow\r\n    Project](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) executable\r\n5.  Add `README.md`, `MLproject`, and `conda.yaml` files and your code\r\n6.  Read instructions in the `mlflow/test/examples/README.md` and add a\r\n    `pytest` entry in the `test/examples/test_examples.py`\r\n7.  Add a short description in the `mlflow/examples/README.md` file\r\n\r\nIf you are contributing to the quickstart directory, we welcome changes\r\nto the `quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py` that make it clearer or simpler.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to provide an example of functionality that doesn't fit\r\ninto the above categories, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1.  Create a directory with meaningful name in\r\n    `mlflow/examples/new-program-name` and implement your Python code\r\n2.  Create `mlflow/examples/new-program-name/README.md` with\r\n    instructions how to use it\r\n3.  Read instructions in the `mlflow/test/examples/README.md`, and add a\r\n    `pytest` entry in the `test/examples/test_examples.py`\r\n4.  Add a short description in the `mlflow/examples/README.md` file\r\n\r\nFinally, before filing a pull request, verify all Python tests pass.\r\n\r\n### Building a Distributable Artifact\r\n\r\n[Install Node Modules](#install-node-modules), then run the following:\r\n\r\nGenerate JS files in `mlflow/server/js/build`:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd mlflow/server/js\r\nyarn build\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild a pip-installable wheel in `dist/`:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd -\r\npython setup.py bdist_wheel\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writing Docs\r\n\r\nFirst, install dependencies for building docs as described in [Common\r\nprerequisites and dependencies]().\r\n\r\nTo generate a live preview of Python & other rst documentation, run the\r\nfollowing snippet. Note that R & Java API docs must be regenerated\r\nseparately after each change and are not live-updated; see subsequent\r\nsections for instructions on generating R and Java docs.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd docs\r\nmake livehtml\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerate R API rst doc files via:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd docs\r\nmake rdocs\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerate Java API rst doc files via:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd docs\r\nmake javadocs\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerate API docs for all languages via:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ncd docs\r\nmake html\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf changing existing Python APIs or adding new APIs under existing\r\nmodules, ensure that references to the modified APIs are updated in\r\nexisting docs under `docs/source`. Note that the Python doc generation\r\nprocess will automatically produce updated API docs, but you should\r\nstill audit for usages of the modified APIs in guides and examples.\r\n\r\nIf adding a new public Python module, create a corresponding doc file\r\nfor the module under `docs/source/python_api` - [see\r\nhere](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/v0.9.1/docs/source/python_api/mlflow.tracking.rst#mlflowtracking)\r\nfor an example.\r\n\r\n### Sign your work\r\n\r\nIn order to commit your work, you need to sign that you wrote the patch\r\nor otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
