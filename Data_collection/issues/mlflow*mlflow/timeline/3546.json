version 1.14.0 the same problem exists. I would like to fix this by committing code, but I'm unsure of the approach. Can someone please advise:\r\n\r\n1. use `dill` instead of `cloudpickle` in `mlflow/mlflow/pyfunc/model.py` and add `dill` as a dependency in `setup.py`\r\n2. use both `dill` and `cloudpickle` in `model.py` and make it configurable in `mlflow.pyfunc.log_model`\r\n\r\nThe second approach is more flexible, and backward compatible if `cloudpickle` is made default. It is quite a bit more work thou.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the preferred method?
