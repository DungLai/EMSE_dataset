@dbczumar, circling back just to clarify I'm looking in the right place before spending a bunch of time. It appears to me that in `mlflow/server/handlers.py` I will need to do something like this?

This will be factored into a function that takes JSON and a schema\r\n    ##  and 400s on failure, and otherwise returns either a placeholder like None or true to indicate validation success\r\n\r\n    response_message = GetExperiment.Response()\r\n    experiment = _get_tracking_store().get_experiment(request_message.experiment_id).to_proto()\r\n    response_message.experiment.MergeFrom(experiment)\r\n    response = Response(mimetype=\"application/json\")\r\n    response.set_data(message_to_json(response_message))\r\n    return response\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if I'm misunderstanding what's happening inside of this method. If this seems correct. I will give it a

in again @dbczumar. In theory, I think this change should be fairly straightforward. See [this comment](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/5350/files#diff-5c10a4e2ca47745f06fa9e7201087acfc102849756cb8d85e774a5ac468cb037R340-R341) in #5350 for an issue I'm having though. It seems like the `_get_foobar()` endpoints call `_get_request_message()`, which in turn calls `parse_dict`, which calls `google.protobuf.json_format.ParseDict`, which appears to take the thing that we need for JSON validation (the dictionary) and parses it somehow and maybe returns the same dict that was passed in. Is that correct? If it is, I should be able to just use the result of `ParseDict` for validation.\r\n\r\nAny input would be appreciated!

To ensure that validation is applied across the various handlers, I'd recommend adding it to `_get_request_message()`. You can creating a mapping from each message type to its associated validation function; when `_get_request_message()` is called, it should resolve the output of `ParseDict` to the appropriate validation function and invoke it.
