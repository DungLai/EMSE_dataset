This allows you to keep key-value pairs as text associated with the Run. You could implement Notes either as a single tag called \"notes\" that holds a JSON-encoded array of strings, or as a set of tags (say \"notes.0\", \"notes.1\", etc if you think the total amount of text will be very large. We might want additional APIs around tags to make this easy.\r\n\r\nThe reason to prefer tags over artifacts was that tags could be edited directly through the REST API, while artifacts are generally expected to be immutable and one can imagine cases where the server only has read access to them and not write. If using tags is super burdensome, however, it may be OK to try allowing editing of artifacts. But in general, we'd like to use tags to implement many forms of metadata in the future without having to add lots of field to the protocol buffers and data model. For example, we'll use tags to remember info about which environment the run was in (say OS type), to let people name the run, to point to child runs that it launched if this was part of a multi-step workflow, etc. All the tags are easy to access in the frontend JavaScript code and we can just treat different tag names differently and render a corresponding UI for them.\r\n\r\nLet us know whether this would work for your implementation of comments. It should be possible to set tags both from the frontend and from the Python API already.\r\n\r\nBTW, one final note about the tag names: we'll probably use a prefix such as \"mlflow.\" in tag names that we want to be \"understood\" by MLflow, so that users can add their own tags with a different prefix. We haven't decided on the exact prefix yet though and this is easy to change later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415304458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415304973","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/303#issuecomment-415304973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/303","id":415304973,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTMwNDk3Mw==","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T06:20:26Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T06:20:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW even without implementing a complete Notes feature, you could begin with something that allows users to add and edit the tags in the Run's UI.

Great proposal and love the Markdown editor/viewer! Thank you for the UI screenshots! Regarding the last one: do we need multiple note entries?
