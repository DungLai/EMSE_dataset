Other mlflow flavors have handled this problem by adding a `code_path` parameter to `log_model` (see [mlflow.pyfunc.log_model](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/852f567797dfcde34c8daffcceec95c64d2c641f/mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py#L1107), [mlflow.pytorch.log_model](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py#L116)).\r\n\r\nWe should be able to do something similar here. **We would welcome community contributions to add a `code_path` parameter to `mlflow.sklearn.log_model`.**\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is to figure how autologging can determine the Python file dependencies. I am sure how we can solve this problem, but think ^ will get us pretty far. Users training models with file dependencies can call `log_model` directly rather than relying on autologging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/999221257/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5802169830,"node_id":"LE_lADOCB5Jx85AhFCqzwAAAAFZ1hXm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/5802169830","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-22T01:54:50Z","label":{"name":"help
