off the bat, I think we can make an improvement [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/sagemaker/__init__.py#L842) by only changing the value put into the `ContainerHostname`. As per the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html#sagemaker-Type-ContainerDefinition-ContainerHostname), it seems like this value only has to be unique within an inference pipeline and I believe in this case each model is a different inference pipeline. \r\n\r\nThey also indicate that:\r\n```\r\n If you don't specify a value for this parameter for a ContainerDefinition that is part of an inference pipeline, a unique name is automatically assigned based on the position of the ContainerDefinition in the pipeline.\r\n```\r\nSince the ContainerHostname is limited to 63 characters, and the value is `mfs-%s`, if we just didnt provide a value, that would free up 4 characters. We wouldnt have to change the logic for creating unique model identifiers yet. I think this value is sort of arbitrary since there is only ever 1 container created by MLFlow when deploying to sagemaker.\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting though, is there docs claim \r\n```\r\nThis parameter is ignored for models that contain only a PrimaryContainer. \r\n```\r\nBut does not seem to be ignored in this case?\r\n\r\n@tomasatdatabricks  What are your

As per the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html#sagemaker-Type-ContainerDefinition-ContainerHostname), it seems like this value only has to be unique within an inference pipeline and I believe in this case each model is a different inference pipeline.\r\n> \r\n> They also indicate that:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>  If you don't specify a value for this parameter for a ContainerDefinition that is part of an inference pipeline, a unique name is automatically assigned based on the position of the ContainerDefinition in the pipeline.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Since the ContainerHostname is limited to 63 characters, and the value is `mfs-%s`, if we just didnt provide a value, that would free up 4 characters.

I think your plan sounds good. It actually looks like the best approach is to not set the container hostname at all. It either is ignored (as the docs suggest it should be) or a new unique hostname will be automatically generated. Either way should be ok with us.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/628296260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3334256663,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMzNDI1NjY2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3334256663","actor":{"login":"tallen94","id":9397454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzOTc0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9397454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94","html_url":"https://github.com/tallen94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-13T23:22:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3334256665,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMzQyNTY2NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3334256665","actor":{"login":"tallen94","id":9397454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzOTc0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9397454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94","html_url":"https://github.com/tallen94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tallen94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-13T23:22:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3334256669,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMzNDI1NjY2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3334256669","actor":{"login":"tomasatdatabricks","id":33237569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasatdatabricks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-13T23:22:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3334256670,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMz
