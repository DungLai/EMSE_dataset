I'm on mlflow version 1.24.0\r\n\r\nI'm logging to mlflow from inside a Jupyter-lab notebook and the run is being logged with an incorrect source of \"ipykernel_launcher.py\".  This is messing with the way git commit versions are being detected too, which is kind of spoiling the convenience of mlflow logging in terms of tracking versions of everything for repeatability.\r\n\r\nFrom some very rough digging in the source I think it might be down to how the \"main file\" is detected inside the `mlflow.tracking.context.default_context._get_main_file()` method.  It's using `sys.argv[0]` to get the current python file's path, but when you execute that inside a notebook this command returns something like `.../site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py` rather than the path to the notebook `.ipynb` file itself.\r\n\r\nThat path is outside of the relevant local git repo, so when it gets used in `mlflow.tracking.context.git_context._get_git_commit()` it doesn't find a valid commit hash.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm looking at the code wrong, is this issue being looked at?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1088631423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adin786","id":46710015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzEwMDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46710015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786","html_url":"https://github.com/adin786","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin786/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
