I'm not overly familiar with the Python side of MLflow outside of `sklearn` models. But [looking at the docs](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html), I notice that the `pyfunc` flavour has a `code` argument. I'm guessing that this loads all of the code from the given directory into the container? That would work for R since the user could export their project directory and then source pre- and post-processing functions as part of their model loading process. I'm not sure what the `loader_module` would be in this instance.\r\n\r\nI also don't have much experience managing R dependencies with `conda`. The concern I'd have is that if I haven't been using `conda` to manage my dependencies when developing a model, will it cause issues if I use `conda` to manage dependencies during deployment? Can it handle non-CRAN dependencies?\r\n\r\nThe emerging standard for R dependency management is `renv`. This creates a \"lockfile\", similar to Python's \"requirements.txt\". The packages can then be restored with `renv::restore()`. Packages from outside CRAN, such as from Bioconductor or GitHub, are also captured this way. This is just a record of dependencies, though --- the packages still need to be installed, and `renv` will install them if they aren't available. In practice, I usually `renv::restore()` in my Dockerfile.\r\n \r\n\r\n

_partial_ solution to this problem would be to add a flavour for models implemented with [the `tidymodels` metapackage](https://www.tidymodels.org/). The `parsnip` package provides a unified interface to various R modelling packages, and the `recipes` package is used for pre-processing. These are combined with the `workflows` package, which both pre-processes and predicts on new data.\r\n\r\nI've been able to save a `workflows` model with a pre-processing pipeline using the `crate` flavour, and it's pretty easy. But I think that this is a significant enough package that it deserves its own flavour.

I'm happy to finish this off and submit a PR.\r\n\r\nThis may deserve an issue of its own. Support for `tidymodels` would give us a way to implement pre-processing, but not entirely arbitrary code.

I assume you're using the `caret` package here? The `crate` function requires that you refer to the _exact_ function that's needed. The `model` that's produced by `caret` is an object of class \"train\". So when you call `predict` on an object of class `train`, it looks for a function called `predict.train`, which in this case is found in the `caret` package. The following works for me:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(caret)\r\nmodel <- train(Species ~ ., data = iris, method = \"lda\")\r\nfn <- carrier::crate(~caret::predict.train(model, .x), model = model)\r\nfn(iris)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn easy way to find out what function is being used is provided by the `sloop` package:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n> sloop::s3_dispatch(predict(model, iris))\r\n=> predict.train\r\n   predict.train.formula\r\n   predict.default\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I then type `predict.train` into the REPL, it tells me that it's in the `caret` namespace.
