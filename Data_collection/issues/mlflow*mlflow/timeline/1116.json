Thus `mlflow` is available on your path but is not installed within your conda environment, so `python` (an executable within your conda environment) is unable to find it. I'd try removing the MLflow installation outside your conda environment & reinstalling it within your environment, such that the parent directories of `python` and `mlflow` are the same. For example, my environment looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(mlflow_python3) ➜  mlflow git:(branch-0.9) which python\r\n/Users/siddharthmurching/miniconda3/envs/mlflow_python3/bin/python\r\n(mlflow_python3)
