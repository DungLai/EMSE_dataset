Also to your question Do you run mlflow v1 on all involved components\r\ncan you please clarify what exactly do you mean?\r\n\r\nWell the version of the R and conda binary should correspond, i.e. when getting the R package version 1.9.1 from CRAN and you run `mlflow::install_mlflow()`, you should see \r\n```\r\nCollecting mlflow==1.9.1\r\n```\r\nWhich is not what you see.\r\n\r\nI also don't see why you are using `with()` above.

[this](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/R-api.html#mlflow-log-artifact) i tried to omit ```client_id ``` and ```run_id``` and just call \r\n```mlflow_log_artifact(\"/home/ealiasbi/mflow/test.txt\",

after waiting for 10 seconds\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm also not disregarding your comment on version consistency.\r\nI have installed mflow 1.9.0 from source . **I could not find 1.9.1 on CRAN** Not sure if that matters??(1.9.1 on conda vs 1.9.0 on R)?\r\n``` \r\npackageVersion('mlflow')\r\n[1] ‘1.9.0’\r\n```\r\nconda package version :\r\n```\r\nmlflow                    1.9.1 \r\n```\r\n\r\n So clearly its the issue of binding experiment to a run id for uploading artifacts.Is there any suggestions on how I can change the code to bind them differently?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/660386338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bickyealias","id":16069726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY5NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16069726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias","html_url":"https://github.com/bickyealias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bickyealias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3560251474,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU2MDI1MTQ3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3560251474","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-18T00:00:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3560251475,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1NjAyNTE0NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3560251475","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-18T00:00:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/660437506","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3069#issuecomment-660437506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3069","id":660437506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MDQzNzUwNg==","user":{"login":"lorenzwalthert","id":10477073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10477073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzwalthert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-18T06:36:17Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T06:37:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"From

you use the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) package so we see where exactly which error occurs? Ideally, we don't change the example for reproducibility and keep it minimal. In your code, you don't create the file `\"/home/ealiasbi/mflow/test.txt\"`, and I don't know if you created it earlier, but it must exist (to stick to the reprex philosophy, I create it in the below code so it should be reproducible). I.e. you can't log an artifact that you have not yet created.\r\n\r\nAlso, you example contains a lot of code that is not required here. I dropped it. I usually log artifacts to a temp directory and then it works. \r\n\r\nThe `client` and the `run_id` arguments are taken from the active run if not specified, so you can simplify:\r\n``` r\r\nlibrary(mlflow)\r\n# client <- mlflow_client(tracking_uri = \"https://backend-mlflow-server.aiaa.ai.cba:4443\")\r\nclient <- mlflow_client()\r\nexp_id <- mlflow_create_experiment(paste0(\"bicky/test_exp\", digest::digest(Sys.time())), client = client)\r\nrun1 <- mlflow_start_run(experiment_id = exp_id, client = client)\r\n# client and run_id are taken from the active run\r\nmlflow_log_param(\"parameter\", 5)\r\nmlflow_log_metric(\"metric\", 0)\r\ntmp <- tempdir()\r\nartifact <- \"mlflow-test.txt\" # sees not to work when placed outside working directory, e.g. artifact <- \"~/mlflowow-test\"\r\npath_before_logged <- fs::path(tmp, artifact)\r\nwriteLines(letters, path_before_logged)\r\nmlflow_log_artifact(path_before_logged, artifact_path = \"test.txt\")\r\n#> 2020/07/19 08:52:10 INFO mlflow.store.artifact.cli: Logged artifact from local file /var/folders/6g/bg5mcmsj7s51r33snbxhm1400000gn/T/RtmpR8pMLz/mlflow-test.txt to artifact_path=test.txt\r\n#> Root URI: /private/var/folders/6g/bg5mcmsj7s51r33snbxhm1400000gn/T/RtmpipOW1Z/reprex1441e7f16cadc/mlruns/0/6d88fc7767cf47279cbbdbefe0122191/artifacts\r\n```\r\n\r\n<sup>Created on 2020-07-19 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v0.3.0)</sup>\r\n\r\nCan you verify that this works fo your (just re-run it?).

think it's important to distinguish the two backends according to the [docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#mlflow-tracking-servers):\r\n\r\n- artifact store (defaults to local file system, can be S3 or similar)\r\n- backend store (defaults to file system, can be a data base)\r\n\r\nCan you verify that the parameters are logged correctly before tackling the artifact problem? Because according to the link above, the tracking uri should be something like `<dialect>+<driver>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`, you have `\"https://backend-mlflow-server.aiaa.ai.cba:4443\"` (and I was not sure if you put this to hide your credentials or if you were really using this URL).\r\n\r\nIf you are running the above code locally, the arifact store should just be your local `mlruns` directory, but if you are running that in the cloud, maybe this does not work and you could try to specify an S3 backend (I remember seeing some databricks error above) when you create the experiment, like `mlflow::mlflow_create_experiment(\"YourExperiment\", \"s3://bucket/path\")`. Note that you need to have an AWS account with the privliedges for S3 described in the above docs and either the aws cli tools or the env variables configured to provide your credentials to mlflow.\r\n\r\nAlso, from your code above, I can't conclude if the code runs successfully if you use the default client (i.e. a local backend store). Can you confirm this, i.e. in your code above, use\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# client <- mlflow_client(tracking_uri = \"https://backend-mlflow-server.aiaa.ai.cba:4443\")\r\nclient <- mlflow_client()\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/665452125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lorenzwalthert","id":10477073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10477073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzwalthert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzwalthert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
