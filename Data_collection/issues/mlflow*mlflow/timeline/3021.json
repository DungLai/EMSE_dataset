But what if I want to install dependencies via pip and a requirements.txt file? The latter doesn't seem to be supported by mlflow. This is a pity, because pip is the standard tool for dependency managements in python. Or, if I'm wrong, at least the documentation should show an example without using conda. So I think this ticket should be reopened.

I started logging this exact same issue, but came across this existing one. Therefore including the populated template below, as there are some commercial reasons to highlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding PIP as an alternative to using CONDA and Docker package management. In which case, leave non-Python dependencies to the user to manage.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n1. PIP installation is quick and painless. Conda these days is extremely slow to install packages.\r\n2. Conda is NOT open source. Therefore, from this perspective it is inconsistent with ML Flow as an open source ecosystem. See https://www.anaconda.com/terms-of-service\r\n3. As a result of 2 above, it is very difficult for a company to use ML Flow. Anything it builds on top of this and consider serving to customers is bound to Anaconda's terms of service, in which there are significant clauses e.g. risk of being booted off.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nPIP is easier, quicker, and better supported than Anaconda in 2021. Though it offers a reduced feature-set (Python only), it is broadly within the target users' interests to consider using PIP.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nI cannot speak for an organisation, but with regards to personal projects, this allows me to build off ML Flow's functionality without fear of Anaconda and its commercial tentacles, licensing and restrictions.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nAnaconda only supports Conda, Docker and Filesystem as formats. PIP could be an additional format like 'File System' where it places the onus on the user to include non-Python dependencies. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents (these may need to be reviewed)\r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [X] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [X] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/917775264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pbower","id":37089506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDg5NTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37089506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower","html_url":"https://github.com/pbower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbower/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1110480363","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3021#issuecomment-1110480363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3021","id":1110480363,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85CMJXr","user":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-27T03:01:20Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T03:01:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi folks, in MLflow 1.26.0, we will be introducing support for virtualenv + pyenv + pip as an alterative to conda.
