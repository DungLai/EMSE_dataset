So the server can only have one request doing work in Python-land at a time. I don't think the server does much in Python-land, but it's not something we've optimized for.\r\n\r\n`ghread` might be even better, since it uses a process pool (one commenter on that issue suggests it worked for them), although this would require adding `futures` as a dependency for python2.\r\n\r\nFor now, I think your initial proposal of adding at least `-k sync|gevent`, keeping the default of `sync` seems reasonable. We can change the default later (before 1.0) if this is a sufficiently common issue for people to run into. A PR would be more than welcome!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/409258904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/409408644","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/220#issuecomment-409408644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/220","id":409408644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTQwODY0NA==","user":{"login":"gppeixoto","id":4645175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDUxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4645175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto","html_url":"https://github.com/gppeixoto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gppeixoto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T00:19:10Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T00:19:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry I was mistaken, I meant the default gunicorn worker type and overloaded the definition a bit - you're correct with the `sync | gevent` options.
