With this in mind I just tried to remove that index manually but I did not succeed because it was needed in a foreign key constraint.\r\n- After that error I just deleted the foreign key **run_uuid** from the table `params` (which was related to the table `runs`).\r\n- Then, as the foreign key was deleted I was able to delete the index `index_params_run_uuid` from the `params` table as I was intended trying before.\r\n- Since I deleted the foreign key from the table `params` I just added it again by running:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE mlflow.params\r\nADD CONSTRAINT `params_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`run_uuid`) REFERENCES `runs` (`run_uuid`)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Finally I could update the database schema by executing: `docker-compose -f mlflow.yml run mlflow mlflow db upgrade mysql+pymysql://<user>:<password>@<database_uri>:<port>/mlflow`. \r\n\r\nThis leaves us with the following scenario:\r\n\r\nThe broken database I was trying to update in the previous post seems to be fixed and mlflow server is running in its version 1.25.1.
