thanks for reporting the issue @arinto & investigating @mateiz, I think the problem is that we remove the `mlruns` directory from the working directory for the run if it exists [here](https://github.com/databricks/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/projects.py#L339), and in this case the working directory for the run is the same as the tracking directory. I believe @juntai-zheng also hit this issue.\r\n\r\n@mateiz I think a fix here could be to just not remove the \"mlruns\" & \"outputs\" directories - users who want to run in a pristine directory containing only their project files can pass the `--new-dir` flag to `mlflow run`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/404675645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1731456706,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTczMTQ1NjcwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1731456706","actor":{"login":"arinto","id":1780348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODAzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto","html_url":"https://github.com/arinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-12T22:53:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1731456707,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3MzE0NTY3MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1731456707","actor":{"login":"arinto","id":1780348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODAzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto","html_url":"https://github.com/arinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arinto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-12T22:53:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1731456708,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTczMTQ1NjcwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1731456708","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-12T22:53:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1731456709,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3MzE0NTY3MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1731456709","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate

We could add a test that creates an `mlruns` folder within a temp directory, attempts to fetch the temp directory, and verifies that the fetched directory's contents match the original as we do
