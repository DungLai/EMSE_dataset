I'd recommend doing so by setting the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable (which will be propagated to the Python process launched to run your Python script) instead of calling `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://some-uri\")` within your Python script.\r\n\r\nCalling `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://some-uri\")` within your Python script and then attempting to execute the script via `mlflow run` won't work unless you set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable to the same value before invoking `mlflow run`, e.g. via `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://some-uri mlflow run ...`. \r\n\r\nThis is because (as @sonnehansen mentioned) `mlflow run` first creates a run against the currently-configured tracking URI (so by default, the ./mlruns directory on your local filesystem) and then attempts to load that run when `start_run` is called in your Python script - if the tracking URIs are different in the two cases, you may see the abovementioned

you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/637792715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ividal","id":2930596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzA1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2930596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal","html_url":"https://github.com/ividal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3399392393,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM5OTM5MjM5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3399392393","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-02T20:38:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3399392397,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzOTkzOTIzOTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3399392397","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-02T20:38:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/644398889","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/608#issuecomment-644398889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/608","id":644398889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDM5ODg4OQ==","user":{"login":"techtutor-co","id":54123278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTIzMjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54123278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co","html_url":"https://github.com/techtutor-co","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtutor-co/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-15T21:25:37Z","updated_at":"2020-06-15T21:25:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
