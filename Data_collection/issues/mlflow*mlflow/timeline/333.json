RestStore is used to talk to remote tracking servers, while FileStore is used to write tracking information to the local filesystem. Both classes are actually intended to be internal - MLflow will automatically use the right store based on the tracking URI you specify (as you stated, you can specify the tracking URI via `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` or by calling `mlflow.set_tracking_uri`, etc). When you call `mlflow.log_param`, `mlflow.log_metric`, etc the right store will be used to communicate with the specified tracking server.\r\n\r\nThe different artifact repositories (GCSArtifactRepository, S3ArtifactRepository, etc) are also internal. We choose which artifact repository is used based on the artifact URI for the current run; when you call `mlflow.log_artifact` an appropriate artifact repo will be used. The artifact URI for a run is inherited from its parent experiment as described [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#storage) - thus you can configure the artifact URI on a per-experiment level. [See here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/158#issuecomment-405410204) for additional detail.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/415237214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1804057208,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgwNDA1NzIwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1804057208","actor":{"login":"nilday","id":3797285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTcyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday","html_url":"https://github.com/nilday","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-23T01:00:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1804057209,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MDQwNTcyMDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1804057209","actor":{"login":"nilday","id":3797285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTcyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday","html_url":"https://github.com/nilday","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilday/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-23T01:00:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1804057211,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgwNDA1NzIxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1804057211","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-23T01:00:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1804057212,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MDQwNTcyMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1804057212","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.gi
