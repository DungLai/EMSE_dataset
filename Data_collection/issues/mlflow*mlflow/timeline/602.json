thank you for the answer.\r\n\r\n> All deleted runs are moved to .Trash folder per implementation in FileStore -- so these deleted runs are easier to find and identify.\r\n\r\nThat's interesting, because I don't observe that behaviour. I've just deleted some runs and they are still visible in the experiment catalog, the only difference is the status in `meta.yaml`. They are moved there after some time or it's a potential bug? But in general - if that worked, it would be fair enough workaround.\r\n\r\nBtw one more question - what about deleting experiments? Why can't I delete an experiment from GUI level? It's really limiting its usage (you have to keep the number of experiments rather small and stable, not dynamic, to not create a mess - 1) it's not always possible to give Data Scientists an access to the filesystem just to delete experiments by hand 2) it can be really dangerous, it's quite easy to delete a wrong folder). And also comparing runs between experiments would be really helpful to create own, optimal per use-case strategy of using experiments & runs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/548392916/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2759953126,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1OTk1MzEyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2759953126","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T14:09:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2759953128,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTk5NTMxMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2759953128","actor":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T14:09:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/548475769","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/602#issuecomment-548475769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/602","id":548475769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODQ3NTc2OQ==","user":{"login":"mparkhe","id":6900999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6900999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe","html_url":"https://github.com/mparkhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mparkhe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T17:08:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T17:09:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are right, i apologize, I misquoted.

even when I use MLFlow Server (pointed by `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`), artifacts are stored locally (as default). In docs I can see some options for setting up FTP, S3 etc. storage, but I still miss how can I just log artifacts to the same server location as experiments and runs (so via HTTP)? Is it not possible until I set up FTP connection with the server? That rather doesn't make sense, if we have `--default-artifact-root` parameter when running MLFlow Server it sounds like there must be an option. @mparkhe

you mean to say that you are creating an `mlflow server` with some `--default-artifact-root` which is not on local file system and yet you see artifacts logged locally? Or do you mean to say that you expect to see the full path in experiment's `meta.yaml` file?\r\n\r\nDo you see the artifacts pulled up on the UI? If that is the case, the artifacts are being logged correctly. Sorry--I am a bit confused. In any case, if you believe that it is a bug (or documentation issue) can you file a different issue (or submit a fix as a pul request) for this? One of us will take a look.
