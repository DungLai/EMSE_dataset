So, in the example above, I'm not quite sure how to actually use this argmax_layer(). I can see 3 paths to explore 1) Should I train the model as it is and then add this extra layer? 2) Or should I add the argmax_layer() to the model and then train it (how?)? 3) Or maybe I should create a model A and model B(where B is A+argmax_layer()), train model A, copy it's weights to model B, then mlflow.evaluate() model B?
