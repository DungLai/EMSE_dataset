I don't know if this helps you at all but I had a similar requirement (selecting threshold based on P-R curve). My workaround was to log the data as a JSON artifact and log the model as a `python_function` with some custom model loading code to load the threshold data from the JSON file as a pandas DataFrame when the model is loaded. At that point you can effectively search the DataFrame to choose the correct threshold.\r\n\r\nYour point still stands about visualising P-R curve natively in mlflow though.
