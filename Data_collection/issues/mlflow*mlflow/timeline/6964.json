For now, we'd prefer to prioritize https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6866 to clearly document the capabilities supported by model version / registered model search, including the ability to fetch model versions by run ID via `run_id IN (...)` syntax. We would also like to introduce support for retrieving a batch of registered models by searching with `name IN (...)`. This way, users could achieve the desired workflow via:\r\n\r\n1. Call search_model_versions() to get a list of model versions; extract the `name` attribute from each version\r\n2. Call search_registered_models(\"name in (<the registered model names from 1>)\").\r\n\r\nDoes this 2-step workflow suffice?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1266030997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7510808502,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85TKehYzwAAAAG_rde2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7510808502","actor":{"login":"wamartin-aml","id":42586848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTg2ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42586848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml","html_url":"https://github.com/wamartin-aml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-03T20:50:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7510808508,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85TKehYzwAAAAG_rde8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7510808508","actor":{"login":"wamartin-aml","id":42586848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTg2ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42586848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml","html_url":"https://github.com/wamartin-aml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-03T20:50:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1266032003","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6964#issuecomment-1266032003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/6964","id":1266032003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx85Ldh2D","user":{"login":"wamartin-aml","id":42586848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTg2ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42586848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml","html_url":"https://github.com/wamartin-aml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wamartin-aml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-03T20:51:07Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T20:51:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That
