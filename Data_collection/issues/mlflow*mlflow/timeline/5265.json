I am using WSL2 and I restricted the memory. The lack of memory turned out to be the problem. \r\n\r\nYour problem may be different, and debugg it (at least for me) was hard because mlflow kind of hides you the error. \r\n\r\nTo investigate what is the conda error, go to `/home/nwoke/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/utils/conda.py` \r\n\r\nHere you will see something of the sort: \r\n\r\n```\r\n135             process.exec_cmd(\r\n136                 [\r\n137                     conda_env_create_path,\r\n138                     \"env\",\r\n139                     \"create\",\r\n140

something like `print(conda_env_create_path, \"env\", \"create\",  \"-n\", project_env_name, \"--file\", conda_env_path)` to see what command is being runned, then run it by yourself and get the proper conda error. \r\n\r\nI hope it
