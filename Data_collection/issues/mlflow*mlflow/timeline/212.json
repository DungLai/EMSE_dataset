As mentioned in the [tracking server docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#running-a-tracking-server):\r\n\r\n> Warning: If you do not specify a --default-artifact-root, nor do you specify an artifact URI when creating the experiment (e.g., mlflow experiments create --artifact-root s3://<my-bucket>), then the artifact root will be a path inside the File Store. Typically this is not an appropriate location, as the client and server will probably be referring to different physical locations (i.e., the same path on different disks).\r\n\r\nThe artifact store (used for `log_model` or `log_artifact`) is used to persist the larger data such as models, which is why we rely on an external persistent store. This is why the `log_metric` and `log_param` calls work -- they only need to talk to the server -- while the `log_model` call is failing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/409260757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/409260905","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/212#issuecomment-409260905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/212","id":409260905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTI2MDkwNQ==","user":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T15:23:39Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T15:23:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing
