I absolutely agree that the MLflow Service API is not the right place to define LogArtifact / DownloadArtifact APIs, but I think it makes a lot of sense to produce a well-defined artifacts REST API in the form of a new proto service (e.g., `MlflowArtifactsService`) that can be implemented within `mlflow server` or an adjacent backend; this will also enable other developers to implement `MlflowArtifactsService` in backends of their choosing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/659962901/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3557032789,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU1NzAzMjc4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3557032789","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-17T08:37:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3557032791,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1NTcwMzI3OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3557032791","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-17T08:37:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
