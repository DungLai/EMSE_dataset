thanks for writing this up! Makes sense to have the MLflow client pass arguments as keyword arguments, so that store implementations can ignore unknown kwargs for forwards-compatibility (i.e. compatibility with future MLflow releases that may pass new arguments to the store APIs) - I'd be happy to review a PR making this change.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to confirm though, I wasn't exactly sure what this syntax meant in the provided example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn **self._tracking_client.list_run_infos(\r\n            experiment_id=experiment_id, run_view_type=run_view_type, max_results=max_results, order_by=order_by, page_token=page_token**)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the important part is that all arguments are being passed as keyword
