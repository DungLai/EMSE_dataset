predict on TF models with feature columns it should be doing something like:\r\n```\r\nloaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(\"model/tfmodel\")\r\n# call the loaded model with a single record to predict on:\r\ny_pred = loaded_model.call({\"age\": [[35]], \"education\": [[\"Bachelors\"]]})\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/43605#issuecomment-739076002\r\n\r\nBasically the `call()` method or at least the `loaded_model` should be made available by MLFlow to allow the direct calling of that method to predict on models with `tf.feature_colum` layer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/763300716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zoltan-fedor","id":3887295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODcyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3887295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor","html_url":"https://github.com/zoltan-fedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoltan-fedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
