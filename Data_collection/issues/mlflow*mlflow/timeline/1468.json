Many ML frameworks leverage pickle (e.g., Scikit-learn and PyTorch) for persisting models. It is possible to leverage MLflow's Models APIs without using pickle: many model flavors (such as `mlflow.tensorflow`) do not leverage pickle; you can also create your own model flavors, as well as custom `pyfunc` models that do not depend on pickle (see workflow 2 in https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#workflows).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/515601836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2513726873,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUxMzcyNjg3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513726873","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:15:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2513726877,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxMzcyNjg3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513726877","actor":{"login":"KOLANICH","id":240344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH","html_url":"https://github.com/KOLANICH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:15:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2513726878,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTM3MjY4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2513726878","actor":{"login":"KOLANICH","id":240344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH","html_url":"https://github.com/KOLANICH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KOLANICH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T21:15:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
