I think I confused the notions of backend store and artifact store. \r\n\r\nThe feature I would like to see is storing/logging ML models in SQL Server and not just the experiment-related data.  This is important for our use cases where the users perform scoring using SQL Server data directly in SQL Server. In many such cases, the models are already stored in SQL Server as Blobs. \r\n\r\nWould it make sense to add a generic db-store interface (a la SQLAlchemy) for the artifact store as well? \r\n\r\nI will update the issue description to better reflect this discussion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/499226838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"avflor","id":18666312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY2MzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18666312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor","html_url":"https://github.com/avflor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}},{"id":2392321130,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM5MjMyMTEzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2392321130","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-05T19:42:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2392321131,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzOTIzMjExMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2392321131","actor":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-05T19:42:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2392324531,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjM5MjMyNDUzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2392324531","actor":{"login":"avflor","id":18666312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY2MzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18666312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor","html_url":"https://github.com/avflor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-05T19:43:40Z","rename":{"from":"Support
