You can identify the problematic run metadata via the following Python snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport yaml\r\nfilestore_root_dir = \"./mlruns\" # insert your filestore dir (string) here\r\nexperiment_id = 0 # insert your experiment ID (int) here\r\nexperiment_dir = os.path.join(filestore_root_dir, str(experiment_id))\r\nfor run_dir in [elem for elem in os.listdir(experiment_dir) if elem != \"meta.yaml\"]:\r\n  meta_file_path = os.path.join(experiment_dir, run_dir, 'meta.yaml')\r\n  with open(meta_file_path) as meta_file:\r\n    if yaml.safe_load(meta_file.read()) is None:\r\n      print(\"Run data in file %s was malformed\" % meta_file_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be curious to see what you find (maybe a run was interrupted midway through creation, resulting in partially-written metadata). Once corrupted run metadata is present in the FileStore, the best way around the issue might be to delete the corrupt run or edit its metadata. In MLflow 0.9.0 you should be able to avoid this class of issue by switching to the SQL-based backing store.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/461715016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2126379059,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEyNjM3OTA1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2126379059","actor":{"login":"LeanderK","id":2179853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK","html_url":"https://github.com/LeanderK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-08T07:30:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2126379060,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMjYzNzkwNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2126379060","actor":{"login":"LeanderK","id":2179853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK","html_url":"https://github.com/LeanderK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-08T07:30:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/461790031","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/873#issuecomment-461790031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/873","id":461790031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTc5MDAzMQ==","user":{"login":"LeanderK","id":2179853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK","html_url":"https://github.com/LeanderK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeanderK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-08T12:38:32Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T12:38:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
