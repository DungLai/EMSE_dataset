Actually, if I want to get in the UI from outside, I have to use the url: `http:/hostname:port` where hostname is the name of the machine that the compose is running in and port is the external port I opened on the compose. Here is the part that corresponds to mlflow in the docker-compose.yml file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  mlflow:\r\n    build:\r\n      context: .\r\n      dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile_mlflow\r\n    ports: \r\n      - ${MLFLOW_PORT:-0}:5000\r\n    networks:\r\n      - network\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ${VOLUME:-./s3}:/data\r\n    command: 'mlflow server --file-store ./mlflow --host 0.0.0.0'\r\n```\r\n(here, if that `data` in volumes and the param that goes into `--file-store` are the same I get the error I explain above.

can you try a something quickly for me first? MLflow requires its file store directory (./some_dir) either nonexistent or a valid file store directory (has at least the default experiment in it if you don't specify which experiment you want to access). So I guess some_dir cannot be the mounted volume itself but its sub-directory instead. In the mlflow server command line, can you try replacing ./some_dir with ./some_dir/myruns? Of course, an alternative is to make sure some_dir contains a valid experiment
