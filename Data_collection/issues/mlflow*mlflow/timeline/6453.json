thanks for the writeup, this looks reasonable! A few minor questions:\r\n\r\n1. I'm assuming the call to `load_model` would restore the model environment if a non-local `env_manager` is specified so that subsequent calls to `predict` on the loaded model can use the already-created env (not sure if there are thread-safety issues with trying to create a virtualenv in parallel if people call `predict` in a multithreaded context, I know there are issues with that in `conda` - multithreaded `predict` seems rare anyways).\r\n2. I'm assuming that if `env_manager=\"local\"` is passed, then the behavior of the API is unchanged, i.e. we warn the user if their local environment doesn't match that of the model.\r\n3.  One requirements question I have is whether it's extra work / necessary to support all currently-supported values of `env_manager` for `mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf` (`conda`, `local`, and `virtualenv`)  in `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model`. For example, would we save any effort/testing cost by only supporting `local` and `virtualenv`? IIRC new MLflow models are logged with dependencies in virtualenv format (I might be wrong), so I wonder if we'd benefit from leaving out conda support. @dbczumar and other committers will know better\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1212550693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7175300588,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85PqhU8zwAAAAGrrmXs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7175300588","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-11T22:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7175300595,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85PqhU8zwAAAAGrrmXz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7175300595","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-11T22:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7175300604,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCB5Jx85PqhU8zwAAAAGrrmX8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7175300604","actor":{"login":"jerrylian-db","id":66143562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTQzNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66143562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrylian-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-11T22:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7175300606,"node_id":"SE_lADOCB5Jx85PqhU8zwAAAAGrrmX-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/7175300606","actor":{"login":"jerrylian-db","id":66143562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTQzNTYy","avatar_url

after discussion, we've decided to deprioritize adding env restoration to `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model` and instead will be working on building env restoration directly into the `mlflow.evaluate` API. To build env restoration into `load_model` we would need to figure out how to kill model servers started by the `load_model` on the death or exit of the parent Python process on all platforms, which would take work beyond our available capacity at this time. In `mlflow.evaluate`, we can simply kill the model server once model prediction is complete.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1220105958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jerrylian-db","id":66143562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTQzNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66143562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrylian-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrylian-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
