Hi Joy. I have implemented most of the features mentioned. Few things here:\r\n1. What is the React Component Name of the \"This run is deleted...\" banner on your mock, if you have implemented something like that before?\r\n2. I can disable the note editing by not allowing the icon shows up on a deleted run page. But to disable tag editing and model registering it seems like I have to add a `canEdit` prop to the respective React component, and let that component decide whether to display the editing field or the editing button. Please tell me whether changing the props of your React components is acceptable. @Zangr
