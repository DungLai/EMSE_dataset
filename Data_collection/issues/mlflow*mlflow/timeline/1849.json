Especially because whenever you press F5 the page scrolls up and if you want to watch for new artifacts, you have to scroll down again.\r\n\r\nAnother good feature would be if the UI would remember choices that I make, e.g. setting log-scale, selected losses, etc. even if I open another run in the same experiment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/943292496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"simonhessner","id":29107077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTA3MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29107077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner","html_url":"https://github.com/simonhessner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonhessner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/1016815728","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1849#issuecomment-1016815728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1849","id":1016815728,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCB5Jx848m2Bw","user":{"login":"sim-san","id":7436938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzY5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7436938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san","html_url":"https://github.com/sim-san","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sim-san/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-19T19:53:37Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T19:53:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Party
