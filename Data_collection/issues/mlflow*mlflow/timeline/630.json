guys, I have a very early draft of the solution in my [fork](https://github.com/jmrr/mlflow/commit/4873a259a3d74f21e17baf6f941e7462bed9c711), but hit a hurdle with the current `gunicorn_opts`. I think it was meant to be used by passing `click` CLI something like `--gunicorn-opts \"--reload --keyfile mykey\"` and then `shlex` would do the string splitting.\r\n\r\nHowever this would be tricky if we go for full native integration without doing something like `gunicorn` does in its CLI as [this integration](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/custom.html) requires a dictionary with the options. I see some alternatives, like taking some of the parsing of `gunicorn`, passing a serialized dictionary in the CLI or suggesting the user to use a `gunicorn` config file. \r\n\r\nShall I create a WIP PR so we can discuss there?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/437621369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmrr","id":8255422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTU0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8255422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr","html_url":"https://github.com/jmrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/531420397","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/630#issuecomment-531420397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/630","id":531420397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTQyMDM5Nw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T23:25:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T23:25:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
