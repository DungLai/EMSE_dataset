Thanks for the illustrative diagram. A couple of things:\r\n\r\n1. You might want to distinguish between a local instance and a remote instance of the tracking server. \r\n2. For local instance, the client directly interacts with the local FileStore (`file:/path/mlruns`) and local backend store if set with `sqlite:///mlruns.db`\r\n3. For remote instance, running at port XXXX, the client interacts with the tracking server via REST API. The remote tracking server interacts with the backend store and artifact store when launched with ---backend-store-uri and --default_root_artifact, including the NFS mounted FS. (The client writes directly to the mounted FS since artifacts may be large.)\r\n4. The dashed box with \"Backend Store\" and \"Artifact Store\" is a bit misleading; they suggest a separate process.\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, a local tracking

@dmatrix \r\n\r\nThank you for sharing the diagrams.\r\n\r\nFirst, data files are uploaded to and downloaded from the artifact storage directly (mentioned at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2834), so the diagram named \"MLflow Tracking Server\" is a bit inaccurate.\r\n\r\nSecond, the database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL) can be accessed through APIs (e.g. REST API, CLI, Python) directly without using MLflow Tracking Server although MLflow Tracking server is still need to use the Web UI.\r\nThis way, the models registered in the Model Registry can be deployed through the APIs even if MLflow Tracking server is down. So, I'd suggest to add the diagram for this more robust setup like

[here are scenarios and workflows](https://github.com/dmatrix/mlflow-tests/tree/master/py/mlflow/server) of how clients and tracking server in MLflow interact with respective backend and artifact

I have reviewed this with the team.\r\n\r\nUse these scenarios as a way to understand how each component interacts with which instance of the backend and artifact store and the respective component code responsible for it. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly,  these workflows have been a source of confusion among users, especially when clients interact with remote cloud storage to upload artifacts where authentication credentials are required. We are working on improving these workflows so that the artifacts are easily proxied via the tracking server (read some discussion in #629 ).\r\n\r\nAfter a review, we'll add these scenarios as part of the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/747068052/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4121993082,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEyMTk5MzA4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4121993082","actor":{"login":"Minyus","id":33908456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTA4NDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33908456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus","html_url":"https://github.com/Minyus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minyus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-16T22:03:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
