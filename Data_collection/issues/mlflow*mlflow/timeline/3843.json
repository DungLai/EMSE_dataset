Thanks for filing this request. Currently, you can compare runs' parameters and metrics, along with schema signatures. Model Registry allows you to compare model versions' MLflow entities. Comparing artifacts is an interesting idea. One can envision comparing two SHAP images, or as you point out comparing images across experiment runs when they are a couple of images that went through a set of filters and max pooling. The problem may arise: which ones do you compare when you have a large batch of images, each undergoing a convulsion? And which ones do you display to compare as there can be hundreds of images?\r\n\r\ncc: @sueann @dbczumar @smurching @AveshCSingh \r\n

Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nRegarding the number of images, I think this feature can initially be limited to a maximum number of artifacts per experiment (let say 10 images for now) to avoid performance issues on both server and client side. When Joe is writing their script, Joe can choose 10 images based on their knowledge.\r\n\r\nI believe this feature is useful during the exploration and debugging phase of a project and not practical during the benchmark phase. For example, let say that Kat has 1000 images of cats and 1000 images of dogs to train a machine learning model that recognise cats. Kat does the training of the model and now need to test it. Kat manually selects 10 images edge cases (image with more than two cats, image with one cat and one dog, ...) to be displayed/compared by MLflow. Kat discovers that the model doesn't recognise kids draw of cats and Kat add it to the issue track. When Kat is performing benchmark against competitors models, no image is displayed for comparison.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/747165705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rgaiacs","id":1506457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDY0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1506457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs","html_url":"https://github.com/rgaiacs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgaiacs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4122992606,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEyMjk5MjYwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4122992606","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-17T02:36:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4122992607,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMjI5OTI2MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4122992607","actor":{"login":"dmatrix","id":1117597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix","html_url":"https://github.com/dmatrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmatrix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-17T02:36:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4122992738,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDEyMjk5MjczOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4122992738","actor":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-17T02:36:29Z","label":{"name":"needs
