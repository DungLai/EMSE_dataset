In MLflow 0.8.0, we introduce support for the Pandas ``split`` oriented JSON format that preserves column ordering. We expect MLflow 0.8.0 to be released this week. This change has already been merged into `master`.\r\n\r\nTo use this format, serialize your pandas dataframe in JSON format with the `split` orientation using the `pandas.DataFrame.to_json(orient=\"split\")` method. Then, post this content to the model server using a POST request containing the following header: `Content-Type: application/json; format=pandas-split`. \r\n\r\nHere's an example of a JSON-serialized dataframe with the `split` orientation:\r\n```\r\n    \"columns\": [\r\n        \"alcohol\",\r\n        \"chlorides\",\r\n        \"citric acid\",\r\n        \"density\",\r\n        \"fixed acidity\",\r\n        \"free sulfur dioxide\",\r\n        \"pH\",\r\n        \"residual sugar\",\r\n        \"sulphates\",\r\n        \"total sulfur dioxide\",\r\n        \"volatile acidity\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"data\": [\r\n        [8.8, 0.045, 0.36, 1.001, 7, 45, 3, 20.7, 0.45, 170, 0.27]\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if this solves the issue you encountered!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/437646962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1958735150,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk1ODczNTE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1958735150","actor":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-11T06:24:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1958735152,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NTg3MzUxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/1958735152","actor":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-11T06:24:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/437733039","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/695#issuecomment-437733039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/695","id":437733039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzczMzAzOQ==","user":{"login":"masa26hiro","id":13010957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDEwOTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13010957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro","html_url":"https://github.com/masa26hiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masa26hiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T02:28:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T02:28:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
