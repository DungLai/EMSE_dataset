Unfortunately this is not currently possible - what's the use case for managing artifact URIs per run?\r\n\r\nit's something we could consider adding - my main worry is that I'm not sure that we'd want to encourage users to manage artifact URIs on a per-run basis, as this complicates e.g. who has permissions to view which data within an experiment, ensuring admins can delete all data associated with an experiment, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks

manually following your comment to PoC it. \r\n+1 for the possibility of setting the artifact_uri of a specific run. \r\nWe seem to have a similar use case where our artifacts are managed outside of MLFlow and don't want to reupload them manually. \r\n@smurching any chance we could consider having this as part of the API ?
