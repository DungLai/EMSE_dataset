@ankit-db , I am an ml engineer who uses MLflow in my personal projects and day-to-day work heavily. There was a use case for interacting Sagemaker Batch Transform with MLflow in my recent project, so I implemented the Python APIs and the CLI supports. I noticed this Feature Request has not been implemented yet. I would like to discuss my design with you and create a PR once you approve.\r\n\r\nDesign for the MLflow Sagemaker Batch Transform integration:\r\n1. The API that deploys the model as a Sagemaker batch transform job: \r\nSince the batch transform job needs to have a unique name, it first checks whether the provided name has already been existing. If no, then it uploads the model from the MLflow artifact to S3 and creates a Sagemaker model. After that, it creates the transform job with the provided parameters via boto3 API. If synchronous=True, it will keep monitoring the process and returning logs until it passed the timeout seconds. \r\n`mlflow.sagemaker.deploy_transform_job(job_name, model_uri, s3_input_data_type, s3_input_uri, content_type, s3_output_path, compression_type='None', split_type='Line', accept='text/csv', assemble_with='Line', input_filter='$', output_filter='$', join_resource='None', execution_role_arn=None, bucket=None, image_url=None, region_name='us-west-2', instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge', instance_count=1, vpc_config=None, flavor=None, synchronous=True, timeout_seconds=1200)`\r\nPlease notice synchronous follows the same logic as the other existing APIs.\r\n\r\n2. The API that terminates the Sagemaker batch transform job with the specified name:\r\nIt terminates the transform job with the provided name via boto3 API. If archive=False, it will delete the model as well as the model artifact in S3. Both synchronous and timeout_seconds have the same logic as the other APIs.\r\n`mlflow.sagemaker.terminate_transform_job(job_name=None, region_name='us-west-2', archive=True, synchronous=True, timeout_seconds=300)`\r\nI also include the CLI support for the above APIs. Detailed info will be provided in the document.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think. I will create a PR once you agree.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/826294706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YQ-Wang","id":20148872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTQ4ODcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20148872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang","html_url":"https://github.com/YQ-Wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YQ-Wang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4640979388,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY0MDk3OTM4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4640979388","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-25T09:55:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4640979391,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2NDA5NzkzOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/4640979391","actor":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-25T09:55:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/826365870","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1472#issuecomment-826365870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1472","id":826365870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjM2NTg3MA==","user":{"login":"ankit-db","id":52183359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ankit-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankit-db/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-25T18:13:13Z","updated_at":"2021-04-25T18:13:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks @YQ-Wang and others for pointing out that this would be useful support to add!
