of things.,\r\n\r\n so I wonder if I need to do all those manual step by step, then it seems I can not automation mlflow project. For my use case, I will host mlflow server in Azure databricks, but our training job and some preprocess like spark and normalization python job are all running in a remote SSH connected cluster. Can we define our MLproject and workflow in Azure databricks, andwil ssh to remote training cluster to execute the python or spark script?\r\n\r\nwhat should be best practice here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/523245082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhangruiskyline","id":1103731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDM3MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1103731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangruiskyline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2571428179,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU3MTQyODE3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2571428179","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-21T00:22:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2571428180,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NzE0MjgxODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2571428180","actor":{"login":"dbczumar","id":39497902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar","html_url":"https://github.com/dbczumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbczumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-21T00:22:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/525514536","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1762#issuecomment-525514536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1762","id":525514536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTUxNDUzNg==","user":{"login":"zhangruiskyline","id":1103731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDM3MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1103731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangruiskyline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangruiskyline/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-27T22:55:45Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T23:11:47Z","author_assoc
