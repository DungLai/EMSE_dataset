@smurching , thank you for your answer. The connection seems fine.

Can you provide some more details? Are you using `tf.keras`/`keras` or raw `tensorflow`? The behavior of `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog` & `mlflow.keras.autolog` is that the model should only be logged at the end of the training (which includes all the metrics that you have logged during the training). Let us know if that is not the case and we would love to follow up on that. We would also suggest file a feature request for disabling artifact logging from the autolog API as suggested by @dbczumar

@HugangR Can you provide some more details? Are you using `tf.keras`/`keras` or raw `tensorflow`? The behavior of `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog` & `mlflow.keras.autolog` is that the model should only be logged at the end of the training (which includes all the metrics that you have logged during the training). Let us know if that is not the case and we would love to follow up on that. We would also suggest file a feature request for disabling artifact logging from the autolog API as suggested by @dbczumar\r\n\r\nI am using tf.keras. autolog to log everything every time works.
