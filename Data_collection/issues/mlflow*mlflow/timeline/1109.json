One recommendation is to use the `mlflow.set_experiment()` API, which will set a global active experiment & use that experiment's ID across both parent & child runs. For 1.0 we may want to consider removing the `experiment_id` argument from `start_run` entirely to reduce confusion / redundancy in the APIs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/483768914/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2280421661,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI4MDQyMTY2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2280421661","actor":{"login":"zhilingc","id":15104168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTA0MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15104168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc","html_url":"https://github.com/zhilingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-16T17:27:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2280421663,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyODA0MjE2NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/2280421663","actor":{"login":"zhilingc","id":15104168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTA0MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15104168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc","html_url":"https://github.com/zhilingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-16T17:27:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/483927966","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1109#issuecomment-483927966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1109","id":483927966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzkyNzk2Ng==","user":{"login":"zhilingc","id":15104168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTA0MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15104168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc","html_url":"https://github.com/zhilingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhilingc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T03:58:37Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T03:58:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
