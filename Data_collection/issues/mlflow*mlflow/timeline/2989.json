summarize, I have 3 problems:\r\n\r\n- Working in **distributed deployment**: mlflow backend server and mlflow projects runs in different machines\r\n\r\n- Working with **Postgressql** as backend store\r\n\r\n- Working with **remote path** as default artifact root \r\n\r\nI keep trying many run configurations, including Windows and Linux (Centos), yet without success...\r\n\r\n- **All local**: (e.g. Windows) The only successful configuration!\r\n\r\n- **Windows backend with remote store and Windows run** (same machine):\r\nIt actually works with **local** path which is the original remote path with host replaced by 'C:' ...\r\n\r\n- **Linux backend with Postgressql + Windows run:**\r\nIt seems to be a buggy code, as I get HTTP status 500 (internal server error), which is: \r\n> psycopg2.ProgrammingError: column metrics.step does not exist\r\n\r\nIt looks like a **bug** (the **metrics** table really has no 'step' column)\r\n\r\n- **Linux backend with local mlruns + Windows run:**\r\nRuns are well saved and displayed in UI, except for artifacts, which are missing!\r\n\r\nAlso **I can't find how to run mlflow project right with a remote backend**.\r\nIn above tries I just run it as a python script, with env: **MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://\\<backend-host>:5000**\r\n\r\nWhen I run in Windows with mlflow (MLProject file exists): **mlflow run -e \\<entry> -P p1=v1 .**\r\nI get the same behavior, e.g. artifact is saved **locally** under C:/\\<remote-uri-without-host>\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/648636895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amiryi365","id":34741654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzQxNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34741654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365","html_url":"https://github.com/amiryi365","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiryi365/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3522960805,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MjI5NjA4MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/events/3522960805","actor":{"login":"AveshCSingh","id":1208791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh","html_url":"https://github.com/AveshCSingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AveshCSingh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T01:29:29Z","label":{"name":"priority/important-longterm","color":"534cb5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/comments/664211064","html_url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2989#issuecomment-664211064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2989","id":664211064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDIxMTA2NA==","user":{"login":"harupy","id":17039389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy","html_url":"https://github.com/harupy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harupy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T08:51:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T09:41:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@amiryi365
