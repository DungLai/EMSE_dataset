\r\nI wasn't explicitly declaring the Docker BuildKit, but perhaps it was already running with it 😄 \r\n\r\nI've modified the `docker_builder.py` using `&&` instead of the semi-colon as your PR resolves to, but it still returned me an error when building anaconda (`bash ./miniconda.sh`), which led me to thinking this is an issue for later macbooks with the M1 chip (my case), since there is no anaconda for the ARM64 architecture yet (that I'm aware of).\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, when modifying the `docker_utils.py` to this:\r\n```python\r\nproc = Popen(\r\n            [\"docker\", \"build\", \"-t\", image_name, \"-f\", \"Dockerfile\", \".\" , \"--platform=linux/amd64\"],\r\n```\r\nIt has successfully installed the necessary dependencies!
