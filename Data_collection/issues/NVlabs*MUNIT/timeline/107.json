Different to LN, IN normalizes the feature cross only spatial which means each dimension (channels) is normalized by its spatial statistics. That's why the correlation is destroyed. You can refer gram matrix (Style Transfer) and U-GAT-IT (combine instance and layer norm).  (You can treat dimension as units in mlp case which does not have spatial information)\r\n\r\n\r\nGamma and beta are the predicted vector conditioned on the input of style feature. In the official implementation, they predict all gamma and beta use wide mlp, i.e., style feature (batch, 8) --> (batch, 256 * 2 * 2 * 9). That means there are 9 residual blocks and each contains 2 convolutional blocks which need 2 gamma & beta pair and the dimension is 256. Due to the benefit that deep structure can fit more complex function than wide structure, instead of predicting all gamma & beta at ones, you can equiped with two gamma & beta predictors in each layer as follows. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass InstanceNorm(layers.Layer):\r\n    def __init__(self, epsilon=1e-5, affine=False, **kwargs):\r\n        super(InstanceNorm, self).__init__(**kwargs)\r\n        self.epsilon = epsilon\r\n        self.affine = affine\r\n\r\n    def build(self, input_shape):\r\n        if self.affine:\r\n            self.gamma = self.add_weight(name='gamma',\r\n                                         shape=(input_shape[-1],),\r\n                                         initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(0, 0.02),\r\n                                         trainable=True)\r\n            self.beta = self.add_weight(name='beta',\r\n                                        shape=(input_shape[-1],),\r\n                                        initializer=tf.zeros_initializer(),\r\n                                        trainable=True)\r\n\r\n    def call(self, inputs, training=None):\r\n        mean, var = tf.nn.moments(inputs, axes=[1, 2], keepdims=True)\r\n        x = tf.divide(tf.subtract(inputs, mean), tf.math.sqrt(tf.add(var, self.epsilon)))\r\n        if self.affine:\r\n            return self.gamma * x + self.beta\r\n        return x\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/comments/1326065884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tom99763","id":69715105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzE1MTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69715105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763","html_url":"https://github.com/tom99763","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom99763/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/comments/1326468909","html_url":"https://github.com/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/107#issuecomment-1326468909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/107","id":1326468909,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5kjIM5PEE8t","user":{"login":"Sarmadfismael","id":57031475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDMxNDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57031475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael","html_url":"https://github.com/Sarmadfismael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sarmadfismael/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-24T13:39:19Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T13:39:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for your detailed explanation  \r\ni just wonder about the LN in up sampling layer, is it the same as in the equation7 in the paper?
