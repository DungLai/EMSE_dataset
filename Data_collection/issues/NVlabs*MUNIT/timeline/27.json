In the commit [972e42](https://github.com/NVlabs/MUNIT/commit/f972e4237e2a8615c80950f2b987924256586e5c), the custom layernorm only supports one image per batch. With the new commit [4c21350](https://github.com/NVlabs/MUNIT/commit/4c21350603d83406a9712f1ea02aa5f564eea0ad), it supports multiple images per batch. However, the time required for each iteration would increase about 4 times when you use a batch size greater than 1. (This is due to the change of the way pytorch implements `view` function in 0.4. For training with batch size greater than 1, please roll back to pytorch 0.3 and use  [munit_pytorch0.3](https://github.com/NVlabs/MUNIT/releases/tag/munit_pytorch0.3). \r\n\r\nBTW, I am still confirming if the performance is the same for pytorch 0.3 and 0.4.
