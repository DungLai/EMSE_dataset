If state_dict is a checkpoint saved before 0.4.0, this may be expected because InstanceNorm2d does not track running stats by default since 0.4.0. Please remove these keys from state_dict. If the running stats are actually needed, instead set track_running_stats=True in InstanceNorm2d to enable them. See the documentation of InstanceNorm2d for details.\r\n\r\nAfter tracing the codes, I guess the problem comes from incorrectly load the pretrained model.
