When I train these image, I find the vgg_w parameter is hard to tune.  If this value is large, the output image quality is OK, but I can only see little translation effect, the output image is almost the same as input. However, when this value is small, the output image is blurry after 1,000,000 iterations. What should I do, enlarging  mlp_dim or somthing else?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/23/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
