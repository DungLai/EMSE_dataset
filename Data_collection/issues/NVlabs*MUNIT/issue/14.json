I used \"edges2shoes_folder.yaml\" and the scale of images are (256, 256). \r\nAfter 200000 training iterations, the result images are also so blurry.\r\nCould you please tell me why did that happen? Is it the reason that the max_iter is still not enough?\r\nI also see that you metioned \"Yosemite summer to winter (HD). We collect a new high-resolution dataset containing 3253 summer photos and 2385 winter photos of Yosemite. The images are downsampled such that the shortest side of each image is 1024 pixels.\" in the paper. So could you please release the yaml file or other changes to the code so that I can do the translation to large images.\r\nThank you!!!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
