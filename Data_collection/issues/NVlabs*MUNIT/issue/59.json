The `image_from_the_domain_b` was in the training set for the domain A.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions about why that might be happening?\r\n\r\nI am using the same set of network hyperparameters as in the `edges2handbags` config on 128x128 images. Translations with random styles, as I mentioned, look good.\r\n\r\nBen","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
