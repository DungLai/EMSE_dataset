But here it is learned from a MLP module.\r\nHowever the affine parameters of Instance Norm are also learned from data during the training, so what the difference between IN and AdaIN in your paper? Will it be ok if we replace the AdaIN with IN and  do not use the MLP ?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
