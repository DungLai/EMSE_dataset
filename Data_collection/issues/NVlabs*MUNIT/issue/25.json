Given one input image, you sample 19 outputs. For every input(edges), do you calculate the LPIPS distance between the given image(edges) and corresponding 19 samples(handbags) ? After that, you sum those 19 groups of data and have a average? Is it the same to other 99 input images in your experiment ? I'm confused about this and looking forward to your reply, thank you!","closed_by":{"login":"xunhuang1995","id":12879207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODc5MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12879207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995","html_url":"https://github.com/xunhuang1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunhuang1995/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/MUNIT/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
