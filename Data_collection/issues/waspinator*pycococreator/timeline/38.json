what we ended up doing.\r\n1. We made extra sure polygons didn't overlap. We ran a script ahead of time to try to take care of this. We created a class hierarchy and at each pixel, chose the class with a segmentation that was the highest in that hierarchy.\r\n2. We tuned the threshold parameter in drawing the segmentations so it was very low. By doing that, it made the polygon a lot more exact and avoided a lot of the issues we were running into.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/waspinator/pycococreator/issues/comments/901866348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rlangefe","id":42874301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc0MzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42874301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe","html_url":"https://github.com/rlangefe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlangefe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
