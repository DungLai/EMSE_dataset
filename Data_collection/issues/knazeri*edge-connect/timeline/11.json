[from here](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/uploads/partialconv/mask.zip)\r\n\r\nAfter downloading, split your train/test/validation set and use the provided [`utility script`](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/blob/master/scripts/flist.py) to generate train/test/validation file list for the masks dataset:\r\n```bash\r\npython ./scripts/flist.py --path path_to_masks_train_set --output ./datasets/masks_train.flist\r\npython ./scripts/flist.py --path path_to_masks_validation_set --output ./datasets/masks_val.flist\r\npython ./scripts/flist.py --path path_to_masks_test_set --output ./datasets/masks_test.flist\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, we use Canny edge detector to extract edge information from the input images. You don't need to create edges file list, unless you want to use exteranl edge information ([HED](https://github.com/s9xie/hed) for example) by specifying `EDGE=2` in the config file. \r\n\r\nFor training just follow instructions in the [readme file](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect#1-training).\r\n\r\nAlso, training the model from scratch takes a long time, you can use the pre-trained weights provided for Places2 dataset to speed up your training.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/452169742/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2059222522,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA1OTIyMjUyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2059222522","actor":{"login":"yejg2017","id":28710917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzEwOTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28710917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017","html_url":"https://github.com/yejg2017","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-08T04:14:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2059222523,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNTkyMjI1MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2059222523","actor":{"login":"yejg2017","id":28710917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzEwOTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28710917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017","html_url":"https://github.com/yejg2017","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yejg2017/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-08T04:14:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2059222605,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIwNTkyMjI2MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2059222605","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-08T04:14:16Z","label":{"name":"Help
