First off, 1,000 images are not enough to capture an entire distribution. I've seen in papers that the FID is reported for more than 10,000 (sometimes 25,000) images!\r\nSecond, please note that FID takes an entire distribution into account and measures the distance between the mean and covariance of two distributions. That means even though some images might not be visually pleasing, the overall quality (of the entire set) might be good!\r\nHaving said that, none of these quantitative measures (FID included) are perfect! Still, the human study remains the best qualitative measure to evaluate generative
