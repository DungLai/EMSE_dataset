It is also possible that there's no image in the training path. Please note that the images in the example folder are for inference, not training. To run the model under training mode you need to create training file-list as [explained here](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect#1-images).\r\n\r\nFor your second question, we only set an upper bound to the number of iterations (not epochs), but I'm surprised that the model stops at 1000th epoch! In my experiments, sometimes python runtime halts which I think is because of the deadlocks happening in OpenCV and/or SkiImage libraries. Basically, we run the data-loader in parallel threads to maximize the performance, but sometimes it causes internal deadlocks in the 3rd party libraries that we use! You can test this hypothesis by setting the number of workers to 1
