However, in our later experiments, we really didn't find a significant improvement over fixing G1 parameters (`mode=3`) and that's why when we released the code, we `mode=3` the final stage. The other reason is that mode=4 slows down training drastically compared to mode=3.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to train the edge model, then you can directly jump to stage 3, that is
