We use Adobe Photoshop for that matter.\r\nIf you only need to test the model with some random mask, then you can either create them in python or use the referenced datasets. But please note that we use binary masks in our model.

A quick solution to your problem is to resize the input image to say `(404, 700, 3)` before passing it to the network. This is a known problem in our model as you can see here: https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/4\r\nOur proposed network architecture is using two convolution kernels for downsampling and two transposed convolution for upsampling. Downsampling operator is implemented in PyTorch such that it when the input is not divisible by the stride, it takes the greatest integer less than or equal to the layer output. When combined with the upsampling operator, the sizes do not match! For example:\r\n````\r\ndownsample:\r\n402 / 2 = 201\r\n201 / 2 = 100.5 => 100\r\n\r\nupsample:\r\n100 * 2 = 200\r\n200 * 2 = 400\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow `400 != 402` and you get error! To make sure you don't receive that error, make the input image divisible by 4!\r\nWe'll fix this problem soon as a pre-processing step by resizing the input tensors if the sizes do not match!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/478249928/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2241055572,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTA1NTU3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2241055572","actor":{"login":"lfxx","id":27956643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTU2NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27956643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx","html_url":"https://github.com/lfxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T14:17:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241055573,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNDEwNTU1NzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2241055573","actor":{"login":"lfxx","id":27956643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTU2NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27956643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx","html_url":"https://github.com/lfxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T14:17:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/479323581","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/38#issuecomment-479323581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/38","id":479323581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTMyMzU4MQ==","user":{"login":"lfxx","id":27956643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTU2NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27956643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx","html_url":"https://github.com/lfxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfxx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T03:40:43Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T14:33:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi,@knazeri,thanks for your answer!
