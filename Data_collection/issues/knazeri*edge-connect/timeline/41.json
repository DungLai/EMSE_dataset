Quantitative measures do not necessarily mean better output quality. I can refer you to this paper: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Features as a Perceptual Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03924)\r\nHaving said that, these measures might give you an estimate of how your model is performing. For better quantitative measures we use FID which has been shown to correlate with human perception! You can use the [`fid_score`](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/blob/master/scripts/fid_score.py) we have provided to find the Frechet Distance between ground truth and model results. \r\nInception score is good with class conditional GANs (say creating imagenet images). It shows how good a model creates images per class. FID is good when comparing any two
