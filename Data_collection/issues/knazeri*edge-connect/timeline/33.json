A few notes to consider:\r\n\r\n- judging by your posted image, you are combining different mask `MASK:5` which we used only for experiments. I suggest to use only irregular mask `MASK:3` to get better results and faster convergence. \r\n- You can reuse the weights we posted to bootsrap the training. It takes a very long time (more than 2,000,000 iterartions) for the model to converge for natural images dataset. I see you are at 17, 000 iteration! Use pre-train weights and let me know the generdator loss value!\r\n- If you want to train the model from scratch, I suggest to start with smaller image sizes. You can set `INPUT_SIZE:128` in the configuration and see if the model is converging. You can reuse the weights when moving to larger input images.\r\n\r\nThe `D2G_LR` flag determines the ratio of the discriminator's learning rate with respect to that of generdator. For example if your base LR is 0.0001 then your discriminator's LR becomes 0.00001.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/456269560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/456282242","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/33#issuecomment-456282242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/33","id":456282242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjI4MjI0Mg==","user":{"login":"Haoyanlong","id":23288056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjg4MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23288056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong","html_url":"https://github.com/Haoyanlong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Haoyanlong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-22T06:09:08Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T06:09:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@knazeri

Thank you for your interest and attention to detail.\r\nThis is an expected behavior of adversarial loss. Normally when training neural network we expect the loss to monotonically decrease. Of course, that's true when we have a fixed well-defined loss term. In case of an adversarial loss, the loss itself is a neural network and the optimization is performed in a zero-sum game between the generator and discriminator. In an ideal world, we prefer this loss to remain constant, meaning that the generdator and the discriminator are learning at the same pace.\r\n\r\nHowever, in practice, these networks are high dimensional, non-convex, non-cooperative functions, and the balance between two players cannot be guaranteed. That being said, a very mild increase in generator loss almost at the end of training is acceptable. That means the generator is learning, but not as fast as the discriminator. And the increase in the loss essentially means that either the discriminator is learning faster, or the generator has reached its limit.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the reason training GANs are difficult. Also, keep in mind that just monitoring the loss is not always working for GANs models, as you should always look at the samples to measure the qualitative performance of the model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/489470779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2319837253,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxOTgzNzI1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2319837253","actor":{"login":"LuckyHeart","id":19172899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTcyODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19172899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyHeart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-05T22:55:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2319837254,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTk4MzcyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2319837254","actor":{"login":"LuckyHeart","id":19172899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTcyODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19172899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyHeart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-05T22:55:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/489487706","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/33#issuecomment-489487706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/33","id":489487706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQ4NzcwNg==","user":{"login":"LuckyHeart","id":19172899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTcyODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19172899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart","html_url":"https://github.com/LuckyHeart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuckyHeart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T02:46:44Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T02:46:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@knazeri
