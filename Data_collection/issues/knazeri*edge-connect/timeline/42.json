, thanks for your reply. \r\nI have another question about discriminator's input. For example, in InpaintingModel model:\r\n\r\n```python\r\noutputs = self(images, edges, masks)\r\n...\r\ndis_input_fake = outputs.detach()\r\ndis_fake, _ = self.discriminator(dis_input_fake)\r\n...\r\ngen_input_fake = outputs\r\ngen_fake, _ = self.discriminator(gen_input_fake)\r\n```\r\nThe `outputs` represents the fake images created by the generator, and it includes all area(mask area and other area). Then the discriminator guides the generator create the same pixel values like in the ground truth images. I don't know if it's better to let discriminator `only guide generator create good pixel values in mask area`. Or may be `create good pixel values in whole area` will help to `create good pixel values in mask area`. \r\n\r\nSo my question is, to the discriminator, will it be better to make the input as:\r\n```python\r\ndiscriminator(outputs * mask + images * (1 - mask))\r\n```\r\nCould you share some opinions?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/465380753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hi-zhengcheng","id":33408107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDA4MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33408107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/hi-zhengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2150607898,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE1MDYwNzg5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2150607898","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-20T01:25:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2150607899,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNTA2MDc4OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2150607899","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-20T01:25:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/465393392","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/42#issuecomment-465393392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/42","id":465393392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTM5MzM5Mg==","user":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T02:23:09Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T02:23:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@hi-zhengcheng This is what we discussed a lot when first designing the model. In principle, it only makes sense to have the discriminator only discriminate the pixel values in the mask area. However in practice, this makes the discriminator too powerful! One explanation might be that there might be some subtle discontinuity around the edge when merging the output with the ground truth surrounding! The discriminator then learns to pick the edges around the mask border and the learning gets stalled!\r\n\r\nWe decided to go with the actual output of the generator instead. Also in case you haven't noticed, our generator is also penalized by the perceptual loss on the entire image which makes its output for non-mask areas very similar to the ground truth, and the input to the discriminator is very similar to what you expect!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/465393392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2150684512,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE1MDY4NDUxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2150684512","actor":{"login":"hi-zhengcheng","id":33408107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDA4MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33408107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/hi-zhengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-20T02:23:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2150684513,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNTA2ODQ1MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2150684513","actor":{"login":"hi-zhengcheng","id":33408107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDA4MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33408107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/hi-zhengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-20T02:23:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/465422780","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/42#issuecomment-465422780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/42","id":465422780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTQyMjc4MA==","user":{"login":"hi-zhengcheng","id":33408107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDA4MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33408107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/hi-zhengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-zhengcheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T04:50:41Z","update
