Using Spectral Norm with a classic non-saturating gan, gave us better results and it was faster to train.\r\n\r\nWe didn't perform an ablative study on the loss function, so NSGAN was just some early experiments we did. We'll probably conduct more thorough research on the loss function, and I'm open to suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/455409704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2081913380,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA4MTkxMzM4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2081913380","actor":{"login":"cmyyy","id":26576058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTc2MDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26576058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy","html_url":"https://github.com/cmyyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T02:53:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2081913381,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwODE5MTMzODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2081913381","actor":{"login":"cmyyy","id":26576058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTc2MDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26576058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy","html_url":"https://github.com/cmyyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmyyy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T02:53:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/455992359","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/28#issuecomment-455992359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/28","id":455992359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTk5MjM1OQ==","user":{"login":"eugenelawrence","id":15603290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjAzMjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15603290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/eugenelawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenelawrence/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T08:47:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T08:47:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@knazeri

Recent research has shown that the generator can also benefit from SN.
