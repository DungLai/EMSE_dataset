The output of the discriminator is a `nxn` matrix with each index corresponding an image patch in the input. The receptive field of the network is `70x70` which means our discriminator evaluates `70x70` overlapping patches of the input image! \r\n\r\n[Philip Isola ](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/issues/39#issuecomment-305575964)has a good explanation for this: \r\n\r\n> This is all mathematically equivalent to if we had manually chopped up the image into 70x70 overlapping patches, run a regular discriminator over each patch, and averaged the results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/476675781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2229985339,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIyOTk4NTMzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2229985339","actor":{"login":"2018hello","id":24759051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU5MDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24759051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello","html_url":"https://github.com/2018hello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-26T14:37:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2229985341,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMjk5ODUzNDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2229985341","actor":{"login":"2018hello","id":24759051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU5MDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24759051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello","html_url":"https://github.com/2018hello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2018hello/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-26T14:37:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2229986148,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMjk5ODYxNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2229986148","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-26T14:37:48Z","label":{"name":"Question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/476717477","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/66#issuecomment-476717477","issue_url":"https://api.github.c
