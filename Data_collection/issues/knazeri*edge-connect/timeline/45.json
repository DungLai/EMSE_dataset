Thanks for your kind and quick reply! This work and the results are really cool! \r\n\r\nIt is true that in CelebA the images are all frontal human faces centered in the image smiling, which is highly structured. \r\n\r\nBut I still do not get the point of \"generalize\". In machine learning problems, generalization usually refers to the ability of an algorithm to be effective across a range of inputs and applications (I just google for the definition of generalization and found this). \r\n\r\nThus, I guess that generalization in the context of inpainting means that the results are visually appealing, rather than being exactly the same. More importantly, as human beings, we are not able to fill the missing area with exact same structures, e.g. the eyes. What we can do is simply giving a perfect visually natural image, not the original image, just as the first line that I cropped from your paper. However, the similar image pairs are very common in your results (or perhaps in other related works, as you suggested). Why does this happen for the inpainting algorithms? \r\n\r\nAny comments would be highly

\r\n> I guess that generalization in the context of inpainting means that the results are visually appealing\r\n\r\nThat's true, and that's what I meant! I don't believe the intent of any supervised machine learning algorithm would be to reproduce the results exactly as its training set, but rather find a mapping from observations to the preferred outputs with the goal that this mapping is a good representation of the underlying distribution. The basic assumption here is that 1) there exists a true distribution in the data, and 2) the training set is a good representative of the distribution.\r\n\r\nNow, back to our discussion, the CelebA dataset is a well-structured dataset and the training set truly represents the data distribution. In a sense, finding a mapping from input to the output close to the 'true' mapping is very much reasonable considering a high capacity model like deep convolutional networks! However, I don't believe by any means, that our model is replicating the input! The images in our paper are very similar to the ground truth, but there are subtle differences between any two images; for example the eyes color and the shape of the eyebrows are most of the times different, the wrinkles, freckle, and moles are almost nonexistant and the results may deteriorate a little for corner distributions like side faces. Besides our model (and others) still struggle to effectively model more challenging datasets like Places!\r\n\r\nBeyonds, it is still a good and open question why generative models are able to model very complex distributions very effectively. Honestly, having worked with neural networks for some time, I should say, these models never cease to surprise me with their unique ability to process an exceptionally wide range of

 Thanks for your helpful comments!\r\n\r\nWhile you kindly help me, I have tested more images with your released code and model (thanks again for this!). Now I have some more observations and new thoughts on the existence of similar pairs.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, as you said,\r\n> The images in our paper are very similar to the ground truth, but there are subtle differences between any two images...\r\n\r\nI totally agree after running more experiments by myself. However, some distributions (such as shapes) of facial features, e.g. noses or mouths, are frequently recovered just like the original images. This is surprising and hard to understand at the first glance. After roughly going through the images in CelebA, now I guess that the reasons are:\r\n\r\n1. The CelebA images are collected from celebrities, thus the images are usually captured from __good-looking__ persons; \r\n2. There maybe some underlying distributions of being __good-looking__;\r\n3. In other words, there are some underlying distributions of the facial features and some connections with other facial parts;\r\n4. Then with known parts, the inpainting model wants to recover the image not only being visually natural, but also being __good-looking__;\r\n5. Therefore, the conditions of being __good-looking__ usually determine the distributions of other facial components. As a result, the recovered images are similar to the original one.\r\n\r\nMy analyses may seem nonesense to the experts in the field of inpainting or generative models, but I believe the phenomenon of generating very similar results needs more explanation as it is really hard to have an intuitive idea.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work and help, Dr. Nazeri. I think my questions are solved in this issue. And I am wandering whether I need to close the issue, since leaving it open may attract some experts to give more reasonable explanations.
