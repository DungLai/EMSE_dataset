If you train the model with a fixed sigma for Canny edge detector then you need to use the same value at test time. However, for our ablation study, we also tried randomly selecting sigma during training (by setting `SIGMA=0` in the config file) as you can see here:\r\nhttps://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/blob/552d260f77ae872b680e9ef2ae67d0cbbc7aedac/src/dataset.py#L95-L96\r\nIn principle, this should make the model invariant to the value of sigma, and since the model is also conditioned on the edge information, one could expect a good model ensemble trained with different values of sigma! However, in practice we found that the inpainting network (G2) yields better performance whenever more edge information is available. We didn't try qualitative comparison for specific inputs, and our observations are merely based on quantitative analysis on the validation set. What you might be able to do is to set `SIGMA=0` for training and then try different values of sigma at test time and compare them qualitatively, which might get you better results in some cases. But one thing is certain, by randomly choosing sigma, your training time increases significantly because the model is now trying to capture all variations in the input space!\r\n\r\nYour second question is basically related to a better edge detection system which is an open question in our work! The Canny edge detector is one of the most basic off the shelf edge detection algorithms, but it has many shortcomings as you pointed out one of them! We also tried HED edge detector, but its output is not a binary mask, our model fails to accurately capture the underlying distribution! A contour detection might be a better choice because it only captures the object borders. But after thresholding, a lot of edge information might also be lost. There's a very good paper about [Contour Detection](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/papers/amfm_pami2010.pdf) which might be interesting to you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/454660512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2076498450,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA3NjQ5ODQ1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2076498450","actor":{"login":"c9o","id":3621788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjE3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3621788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o","html_url":"https://github.com/c9o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-16T05:49:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2076498451,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNzY0OTg0NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/events/2076498451","actor":{"login":"c9o","id":3621788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjE3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3621788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o","html_url":"https://github.com/c9o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-16T05:49:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/comments/454667910","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/26#issuecomment-454667910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/26","id":454667910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDY2NzkxMA==","user":{"login":"c9o","id":3621788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjE3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3621788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o","html_url":"https://github.com/c9o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T06:31:46Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T06:31:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@knazeri
