So I have some questions.\r\nin edgeconnect.py\r\nafter load the edgeconnect (“self.train_dataset = Dataset(config, config.TRAIN_FLIST, config.TRAIN_EDGE_FLIST,config.TRAIN_MASK_FLIST,augment=True, training=True)”，self.train_dataset will have  train and edge and mask files' path）\r\nbut then it begin training，and i see that ，in after“ for items in train_loader”，it will become four kinds of data(images, images_gray, edges, masks)?\r\nCan you sovle my problems?
