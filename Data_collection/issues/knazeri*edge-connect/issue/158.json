When we use 'imread' to read a picture, the black part will be displayed as 0 and the white part will be displayed as 255. But our damaged area is represented in black in the mask picture, and converted to a value is 0. According to this calculation, there is a problem, for example: outputs = outputs * masks + edges * (1-masks). This is not a picture with the repaired part + the original picture as the damaged part. I wonder if you understand my question? I hope I have time to answer my questions, thank you~","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
