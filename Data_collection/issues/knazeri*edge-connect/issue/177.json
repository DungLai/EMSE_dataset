I have used your implementation to train from scratch. I stay all your settings unchanged, but only use another remote sensing dataset, which contains only 800 training images with size 256x256. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, I trained a edge model with \"MODEL=1\". It is observed that after 1000 epoches training, the edge model does learn something, but very slow and far from convergency.\r\n\r\n![00001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45393123/159655719-352bd3cd-5150-4f07-b0d1-6f6b87162041.png)\r\n![67000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45393123/159655733-32b8ed17-7a7f-4115-837c-4a184befb9f8.png)\r\n\r\nThe above images are the samples during training after 1 and 67000 iterations respectively. It shows that the edge model was learning throughout the whole training procedure, but could you tell me why does the estimated results so bad?\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I have also trained a inpainting model alone with \"MODEL=2\", but I get a very different results from the results above, as I list below. It is clear that the inpainting model convergenced successfully, which proves the correctness of the training strategy. So Why I get a results above? \r\n\r\n![99000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45393123/159657636-06bebaf4-c375-460b-934b-a68b196a6001.png)\r\n\r\nLooking for your replys.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
