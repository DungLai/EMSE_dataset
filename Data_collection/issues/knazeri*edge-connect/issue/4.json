Maybe we can add a `resize()` in the `test()` function.      \r\n- Below is some debug prints:\r\n```\r\nimages size is torch.Size([1, 3, 256, 265]),\r\n edges size is torch.Size([1, 1, 256, 265]),\r\n masks size is torch.Size([1, 1, 256, 265])\r\n\r\nimages_masked size torch.Size([1, 3, 256, 265])\r\n edges size after `EdgeModel` is torch.Size([1, 1, 256, 264])\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
