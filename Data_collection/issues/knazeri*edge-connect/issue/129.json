About image dataset, I am using JPEG images which downloaded from [google's dataset](http://www.hdrplusdata.org/):\r\nI split 720 X 720 images from their 4K image, and trying to use it as image dataset.\r\nDoes it work?\r\n\r\n2). I am not sure, but you've been using 3 channel images in testing. If there is any one image with 4 channels in train/test/val images, then it will cause any problem while training?\r\n\r\n3). About model stage, I need to run 3 steps to get final model?\r\nYou've wrote in [README](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/blob/master/README.md):\r\n```\r\nEdgeConnect is trained in three stages: 1) training the edge model, 2) training the inpaint model and 3) training the joint model. To train the model:\r\n```\r\nIt does mean that I need to run `train.py` for 3 times with stage 1,2,3 to get final model?\r\n\r\n4). About checkpoints, I can't use your pretrained checkpoints since I am using new image dataset?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
