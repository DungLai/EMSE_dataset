There is a problem that when i test the model with damaged images, i can't get the generated edge information through the edge generator. Same things as this, i can't get a inpainted image through the image inpainting network. But when i input a no damaged image and mask image, the picture can be inpainted. If i want to input a damaged image directly to test the network, what should i do?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
