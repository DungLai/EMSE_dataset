EVAL_INTERVAL in config is 0, so did you not add validation to your training? \r\n2. When testing, new input and mask are provided, so the test set of the original celeba data is not used?\r\n3. In the model 2 training section, the training will not stop until 1999999  iterations, which is obviously over-fitting.
