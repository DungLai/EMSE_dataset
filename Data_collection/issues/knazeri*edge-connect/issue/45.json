They are really cool, but the results in the pictures have different style. That is, some results are nearly same with the original pic while others not (but still visually perfect). For example, in Fig 15, the following results:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12553253/53093747-43f1f980-3553-11e9-967f-ace49c3d9b30.png)\r\nIn all of the three images, eyes (or mouth) are missing. For the first image, it is recovered with a synthesized person, while for the 2-3 lines, the recovered images are actually the same as the original image.\r\nMy questions are:\r\nQ1: Are the images selected from a test (validation) set, which is not used for training? Or only mask is seperated into training/val/test?\r\nQ2: Are there any overlapping person between the train/val/test set? Intuitively, the results in the above 2-3 lines is due to the existing of the same person in the train/test set.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
