But I have some questions. How to test image with a white mask in HED detection, if we just apply the HED into the corrupted image, there must are obviously thick line around the border of holes in the generated image by HED. How to remove these lines?\r\nAnd how do u get mask group in the different sizes,  such as 10%~20%, could you give me some clues about it or sorted mask dataset?
