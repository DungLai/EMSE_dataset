I wonder if I should use same sigma in config for training stage and test stage.\r\nFor example can I use sigma = 3 when training but use sigma = 1 when testing?\r\n2. Another question, is it possible to use different sigma values automatically for different images?\r\nUsing fixed sigma, sometimes too less edges are detected  and sometimes too more.","closed_by":{"login":"c9o","id":3621788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjE3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3621788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o","html_url":"https://github.com/c9o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c9o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
