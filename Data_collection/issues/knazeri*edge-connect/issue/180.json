I set up environment which I guess should be fine:\r\n- pytorch 1.0.1, torchvision 0.2.1(I also tested torchvision 0.2.2 and pytorch 1.3.0 without any successes)\r\n\r\nI set batch size to 1, because I thought that maybe there is a problem with to big batch size, as I have only 1 GPU.\r\nMy guess is that on VM from colab the nviddia drivers, CUDA and cuDNN are much younger than what was used back in 2019. Nevertheless, here is my configuration as well as outcome.
