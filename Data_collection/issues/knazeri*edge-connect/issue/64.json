There are five columns, I guess the first and last ones are GT pictures, while the second column is the masked pictures. \r\n\r\nMy questions are: is the third column edges from GT or from masked images? If the pictures are from the subfolder /samples/inpaint/, does it mean that the fourth column is the 'prediction results' of inpaint model? The dataset are from validation picutures, so they won't be truly predicted results.
