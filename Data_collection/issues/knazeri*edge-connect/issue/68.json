The results is not good so far. The example results look good. I change the example list and I then get confused.\r\nI delete the code \r\n#        if config.MODE == 2:\r\n#            self.mask = 6\r\nthen config.MODE =3 which is random external mask.\r\nAccording to my debug, the first image is processed with the 5th mask. However, the result seems that it was processed with the first mask. I am not clear about this problem.\r\nCould you give any idea?\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\n\r\n![places2_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40591750/55527828-40629e00-56cd-11e9-94ef-f9791594c3f9.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
