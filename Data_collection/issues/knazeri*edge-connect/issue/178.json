For Paris StreetView, since the images in the dataset are elongated (936 x 537), we separate each image into three: 1) Left 537 x 537, 2) middle 537 x 537, 3) right 537 x 537, of the image. These images are scaled down to 256x256 for our model, totaling 44; 700 images. \r\n\r\nAnd after little test, I feel this number has a big impact on the results.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe you have some experience about it.\r\n\r\nCould you share it? I really appreciate it.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
