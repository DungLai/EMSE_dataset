In your\r\n coder, the input=(images * (1 - masks)) + masks, that means the white pixel in the irregular mask is the holes,that is different from Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions. I observed the most irregular masks have large white regions that result in most inputs only a little regions remains,and the edge predict are not perfect. \r\n  \r\n![768000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40750189/51026689-11ef8e00-15ca-11e9-91fa-5d1a6a37ba52.png)\r\nI think may be change the input=(images * (1 - masks)) + masks to  input=(images *  masks + masks\r\n is better?","closed_by":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
