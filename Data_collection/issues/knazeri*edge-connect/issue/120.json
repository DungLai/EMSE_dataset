You use 'DataParallel' to support  multi-gpu training. The standard way for saving models with 'DataParallel' is to use `torch.save(model.module.state_dict(), PATH)`. However, in your code, you just use `        torch.save({\r\n            'discriminator': self.discriminator.state_dict()\r\n        }, self.dis_weights_path)`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
