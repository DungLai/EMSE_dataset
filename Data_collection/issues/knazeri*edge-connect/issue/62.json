(star)\r\nI have a few questions about the discriminator:\r\n\r\n1. What's the pros and cons for the three GAN loss functions (nsgan, lsgan and hinge) for edge-connect? Is there any visual/numerical comparison or reason to use them?\r\n\r\n2. The default GAN loss is nsgan. Are the pretrained models all trained with nsgan?\r\n\r\n3.  I like your implementation of the adversarial loss\r\nhttps://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/blob/698509d1ac1d7a40310139f9e4d70410b3d734e4/src/loss.py#L31-L43\r\nHowever, when I use it for my discriminator, the Loss_D and Loss_G  always stay in a very small range (e.g., for hinge loss, Loss_D will stay in 1 while Loss_G will stay in -1; for lsgan, Loss_D will stay in 0.25 +- 0.001 and Loss_G 0.25 +-0.02; nsgan 0.693 +- 0.01). \r\nThe image quality does improve though, but I wonder if that is normal? What does a normal training curve look like? \r\nFYI, I use spectral normalization for both the generator and discriminator.","closed_by":{"login":"amjltc295","id":12747125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzQ3MTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12747125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295","html_url":"https://github.com/amjltc295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amjltc295/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
