So, not random masks? Very much as in testing mode. My dataset consists of images and a mask file for each image.\r\n\r\nCan I, for example, use mask type 6 in the config?\r\n\r\n```   # test mode: load mask non random\r\n        if mask_type == 6:\r\n            mask = imread(self.mask_data[index])\r\n            mask = self.resize(mask, imgh, imgw, centerCrop=False)\r\n            mask = rgb2gray(mask)\r\n            mask = (mask > 0).astype(np.uint8) * 255\r\n            return mask\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Meulen92","id":12654702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjU0NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12654702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92","html_url":"https://github.com/Meulen92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Meulen92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
