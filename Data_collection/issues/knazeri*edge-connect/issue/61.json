Have you tried other approaches to resolve this issue (e.g. modified adversarial loss, additional discriminator, modified edge detection etc)? \r\n\r\nSince your model is applicable to higher resolutions I tried to continue training on 512x512 using your pretrained model. \r\n\r\nQ2: Do you think that this approach is valid or it is better to train whole model from scratch.\r\nQ3: I'm curious about your thoughts about using edge-connect in higher resolutions and bigger masks. Do you have any suggestions for architectural modifications or can think of any other steps that probably should be taken besides provided code?\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"fskurniak","id":33847109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQ3MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33847109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak","html_url":"https://github.com/fskurniak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fskurniak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/61/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/knazeri/edge-connect/issues/61/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
