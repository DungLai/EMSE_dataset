\r\nThat would be fantastic if you could provide the cleaned up dataset.\r\n\r\nFor your long-term solution to making it easy to pretrain BERT models, I see at least 2 possibilities:\r\n(1) Gluon-NLP could provide a static cleaned up Wikipedia dataset that is compatible with `scripts/bert/run_pretraining.py`. And, `run_pretraining.py` could look for the cleaned up dataset and download it if it's not already on disk.\r\n(2) Gluon-NLP could provide a script that downloads the latest Wikipedia dump and then cleans it up in such a way that it becomes compatible with `scripts/bert/run_pretraining.py`.\r\n\r\nI think (1) is a more attractive solution because it allows the whole community to use exactly the same data.

working on preparing a Wikipedia dataset for pretraining.\r\n\r\nHere's what I've done so far:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# get latest wikipedia dump\r\nwget https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2\r\n\r\n# https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor\r\npython wikiextractor/WikiExtractor.py enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2 # saves in /path/to/text\r\n\r\n# create a tiny training set (using just 1 of the ~13000 files generated by WikiExtractor)\r\npython gluon-nlp/scripts/bert/create_pretraining_data.py --input_file /path/to/text/AA/wiki_00 --output_dir /path/to/train --dataset_name book_corpus_wiki_en_uncased --dupe_factor 10 --num_workers 16\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if I look at what's produced by WikiExtractor, it looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<doc id=\"12\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12\" title=\"Anarchism\">\r\nAnarchism \r\n\r\nAnarchism is an anti-authoritarian political philosophy that rejects hierarchies deemed unjust and advocates their replacement with self-managed, ...\r\n```\r\nI notice two things here:\r\n1. Before each article, there's a `<doc id=...>`, and after each article, there's a `</doc>`.\r\n2. Before each article is a title (which is often just one word, and at most a few words).\r\n\r\nSo, here's my question to anyone who's done this before: \r\nWhen you preprocess the Wikipedia data, do you also use something like WikiExtractor? If so, do you typically remove the `<doc>`  and Title lines before running `create_pretraining_data.py`?\r\n\r\nFinally: Once I get this all running correctly, I'll try to automate the Wikipedia preprocessing procedure (for `possibility (2)` above), and if it works, I will submit a PR. (Or... if one of the real Gluon-NLP developers is working on a script for this, then I'm sure your version will be better.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/510399736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"forresti","id":2020010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjAwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2020010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti","html_url":"https://github.com/forresti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/511678293","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/641#issuecomment-511678293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/641","id":511678293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTY3ODI5Mw==","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T06:04:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T06:04:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @forresti sorry for the late response. I was traveling for the past few days. I pushed some text cleansing code in https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/text-proc (the doc is out-dated, but you have some idea what's inside). \r\n\r\nYes I used WikiExtractor, and replaced the `<doc>` token with newlines before running the training code. And, actually, `create_pretraining_data.py` is not necessary anymore, because now the training script supports generating pre-training samples on the fly (see http://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/master/model_zoo/bert/index.html#run-pre-training) \r\n\r\nCurrently the code in https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/text-proc is not very organized, if you can submit a PR with a script that automates the whole thing, that will be awesome. \r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, I'll upload the pre-processed Wikipedia dataset tomorrow
