seems to be caused by intermittent downtime of the clic.cimec.unitn.it server.\r\nWhile we are likely allowed to redistribute the MEN dataset (it is not 100% clear if the permissive license applies to the dataset or just only models trained on the dataset) and could thereby control the source server, we can't redistribute most other datasets.\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest not to clean the cached datasets downloaded from external hosts between subsequent test runs. To make sure we catch URLs that go down permanently, we would have to set up a separate CI job that once in a while runs the complete test suite after cleaning the cached datasets.\r\n\r\nI don't have access to the CI configuration, but I suppose this is feasible. If there is no objection I will implement the cache of external datasets now to make sure we won't experience any such intermittent test failures in future. Then in a follow-up we can set up the scheduled test without cache. For that I either need access to the CI configuration or someone (@szha ?) would have to enable it.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any alternative suggestions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/383347737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1587683355,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU4NzY4MzM1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/1587683355","actor":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-22T01:36:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1587683356,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1ODc2ODMzNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/1587683356","actor":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-22T01:36:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/383354946","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/56#issuecomment-383354946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/56","id":383354946,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzM1NDk0Ng==","user":{"login":"cgraywang","id":25714264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang","html_url":"https://github.com/cgraywang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-22T04:39:31Z","updated_at":"2018-04-22T04:39:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, is the cache of the dataset that is not allowed to redistribute allowed?
