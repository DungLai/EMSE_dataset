It is actually simple to use API in the batchify API including the [PAD operator](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/bcae0fef59d31d9524c9bc513852b2e897a5e0b2/src/gluonnlp/data/batchify/batchify.py#L160) in GluonNLP. Could you please try the PAD the data first and then handle the PAD in the loss if necessary?\r\n\r\nFor question 2, since the `ConvolutionEncoder` API is mostly used in the embedding layer of many seq2seq model, especially providing the character embedding. The seq2seq model in the NLP mostly requires the input in the layout of `TNC`,  besides as you know, the `Conv` operators requires the first dimension to be N (batch_size) and second dimension to be C (channel), so it is necessary to have this in the API.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have more questions.

Thank you!\r\n\r\nBut for the first problem, if I pre-populate the data, it seems that I can't consider all the situations, because if I use multiple different convolution kernels, the size of the pad for each kernel is different.  At this point, using the PAD operation in the batchify seems a little cumbersome, and it seems more straightforward to provide padding parameters in Conv1D for each kernel at this location. Maybe padding doesn't have much impact, I'm not sure about it. But I recommend adding the padding parameter to improve generality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/449967532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vanewu","id":27672489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjcyNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27672489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu","html_url":"https://github.com/vanewu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2044623867,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA0NDYyMzg2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2044623867","actor":{"login":"cgraywang","id":25714264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang","html_url":"https://github.com/cgraywang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-26T13:35:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2044623868,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNDQ2MjM4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2044623868","actor":{"login":"cgraywang","id":25714264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang","html_url":"https://github.com/cgraywang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgraywang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-26T13:35:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
