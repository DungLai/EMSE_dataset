The encoding/decoding interface can thus be simplified to\r\n    ```\r\n   def __call__(self, inputs, states=None):\r\n      ...\r\n   ```\r\n   Refer: https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/master/scripts/nmt/encoder_decoder.py#L151\r\n- [ ] The encoder/decoder may return multiple objects. For example, the user may also want to check the attentional weights in the decoding phase. Our previous solution is to use a list to store these additional objects (`additional_outputs` in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/master/scripts/nmt/encoder_decoder.py#L214-L215). We decide to store them in a dictionary and add a `query_string` flag in the initializer to indicate which objects will be returned.\r\n- [ ] Add `state_info` in the encoder/decoder to specialize the layout/shape/name of the states, like those in the mxnet/RNN\r\n- [ ] Make sure the new `Decoder` can be fed into `BeamSearchSampler` to generate samples.\r\n\r\n(More to be added)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/425608734/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
