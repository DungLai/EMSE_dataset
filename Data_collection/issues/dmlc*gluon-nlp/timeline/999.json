you can adapt the parallel function for the purpose of pushing work to GPU more efficiently. The main purpose of that interface is to push work with multiple threads using multithreaded queues. See https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/v0.x/src/gluonnlp/utils/parallel.py#L125-L139. For forward-only, you just need to implement only the forward part, in which case autograd.record isn't needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/827655079/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4651248667,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY1MTI0ODY2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/4651248667","actor":{"login":"feevos","id":14290519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjkwNTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14290519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos","html_url":"https://github.com/feevos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-27T14:34:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4651248672,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2NTEyNDg2NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/4651248672","actor":{"login":"feevos","id":14290519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjkwNTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14290519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos","html_url":"https://github.com/feevos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-27T14:34:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/827667126","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/999#issuecomment-827667126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/999","id":827667126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNzY2NzEyNg==","user":{"login":"feevos","id":14290519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjkwNTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14290519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos","html_url":"https://github.com/feevos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feevos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-27T14:50:23Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T14:50:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much @szha !!!
