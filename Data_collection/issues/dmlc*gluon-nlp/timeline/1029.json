It can handle the one-to-many case similar to the squad sliding window case described in the issue.\r\n\r\nThe dataset base class is in Gluon, so the change proposal should eventually be moved there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/560042889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/560043545","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1029#issuecomment-560043545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1029","id":560043545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDA0MzU0NQ==","user":{"login":"zburning","id":26197318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTk3MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26197318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning","html_url":"https://github.com/zburning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-01T02:43:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T02:43:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great advice!
