for the delay, in order to make Amazon SageMaker training easy we would need the following:\r\n•\tCreate a dataset-root/model-root location so we choose where we grab datasets from (rather than assuming they are in a certain location.\r\n•\tCreate a flag to specify where we save model-artifacts and checkpoints\r\n•\tEnsure training works on SageMaker Training (sometimes there are problems with Horovod and downloading pre-trained models). \r\n•\tDo one of the 2 following solutions:\r\n1.\tModify the arguments so that SageMaker training can work more easily.\r\na.\tModify, input arguments so they align with the arguments SageMaker needs for training.\r\n    parser.add_argument('--model-dir', type=str, default=os.environ['SM_MODEL_DIR'])\r\n   \t
