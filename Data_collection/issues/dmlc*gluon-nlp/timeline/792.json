The purpose of the filter is to allow Datasets like TextlineDataset to load a subset of the dataset to memory, in case the dataset is too large to fit into memory. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the split sampler is designed with data.SimpleDatasetStream where the data is already split into multiple parts, stored on the disk. But in many cases there is a single file and we still want to do multi-gpu training. \r\n\r\nI do agree that we should enhance the sampler to make multi-gpu training easier. Actually there's `num_shards` option in data.FixedBucketSampler that splits the data into multiple logical shards. Currently it returns the index for all shard for each iteration, and we can just add a `shard_idx` argument to support multi-process training. I'm currently busy with other tasks. Would this be something you'd like to contribute? I'm happy to give more pointers/explanations if you need :)
