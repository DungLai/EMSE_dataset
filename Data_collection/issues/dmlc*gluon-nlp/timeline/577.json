I have been using gluon-nlp for a while but never checked every details in this project. I will appreciate all your helps before I get used to everything!\r\n\r\nThe first question I have is about the api design. Classes implemented in the [src/gluonnlp/embedding/token_embedding.py](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/master/src/gluonnlp/embedding/token_embedding.py) require a source to be initialized. In this case, are we going to support w2v in source list only for this `from_file` method? \r\n\r\nOr would it be expected do the similar idea like `load_fasttext_format` in `FasttextEmbeddingModel`? In this case, people can load their own w2v (probably either text or binary).
