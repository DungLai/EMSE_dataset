The following example consists of 2 documents, where each line is considered as a sentence in a document. \r\n```\r\nWe use wikipedia corpus.\r\nWikipedia is great.\r\n\r\nWe also use bookcorpus.\r\nBookcorpus is also helpful.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when the `tokenize_lines` function reaches the end of the file, `if not line` is triggered and we break the loop. When the function reads the empty line between two documents, the second `if not line` is triggered after `line.strip()` on `line = '\\n'`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/1232325601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"szhengac","id":3960020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjAwMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3960020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac","html_url":"https://github.com/szhengac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhengac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
