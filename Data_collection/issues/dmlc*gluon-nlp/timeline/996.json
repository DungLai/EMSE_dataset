So you could say that they don't share parameters, but rather are the same.\r\nYou are right that for sharing parameters between separate `Blocks`, you need to pass the `ParameterDict` of the other `Block` via the `params` argument. With repsect to the `NMTModel`, you can see an example of sharing between the `TransformerDecoder` used during training and the `TransformerOneStepDecoder` used during testing at:

have further questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/548991745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2764799634,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2NDc5OTYzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2764799634","actor":{"login":"zeeshansayyed","id":543495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed","html_url":"https://github.com/zeeshansayyed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-02T00:29:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2764799635,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjQ3OTk2MzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2764799635","actor":{"login":"zeeshansayyed","id":543495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed","html_url":"https://github.com/zeeshansayyed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshansayyed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-02T00:29:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2764806837,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc2NDgwNjgzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2764806837","actor":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-02T00:37:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/551878175","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/996#issuecomment-551878175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp
