I guess this will be addressed by numba at some point, but for now that does not help us.\nFor easily supporting Cython, we can choose the Pure Python mode, allowing any Cython code we write to be interpreted if Cython is not installed given that we include a copy of Cython Shadow.py in GluonNLP.\n\nAlso see http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html and https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.29.x/Cython/Shadow.py\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/147#issuecomment-434284901>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AE8D7phTdNo-8AoePL2UsZt81O0DPoItks5uqEj6gaJpZM4UlcW0>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/434297457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/434572689","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/147#issuecomment-434572689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/147","id":434572689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDU3MjY4OQ==","user":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-31T06:10:14Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T06:10:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would argue we can simply add a *requirement* on Cython in the following sense:\r\n\r\n- python distutils (`setup.py`) transparently falls back to transpiled C code if the user does not have cython.
