AWS recently added CloudFront endpoints in Hong Kong and [mainland China](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/04/amazon-cloudfront-is-now-available-in-mainland-china/). \r\nS3 Accelerate doesn't make use of the endpoints in mainland China though, but maybe they will in the future.\r\n\r\nDo we have any reports of trouble downloading in China? I'll close this for now, but let's reopen once we have more evidence of the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/565304891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2880223050,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg4MDIyMzA1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2880223050","actor":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-13T05:22:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/565555616","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/42#issuecomment-565555616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/42","id":565555616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTU1NTYxNg==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T18:31:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T18:31:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@leezu they won't.
