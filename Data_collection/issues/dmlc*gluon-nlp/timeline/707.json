dy":"So if I understand correctly the issue is that @eric-haibin-lin would like to spawn processes within the environment executing `DatasetStream.__iter__`.\r\nNow this normally would be the standard python main process and there wouldn't be any issue; however, `PrefetcherIter` allows wrapping `DatasetStream.__iter__` into a separate (daemonic) process. Daemonic processes cannot spawn further processes in Python.\r\n\r\n@zhreshold I'm not sure if extending SimpleDatasetStream with an option to prefetch dataset would solve the issue: It doesn't matter if SimpleDatasetStream or PrefetchIter is responsible for creating the separate (daemonic) process within which `DatasetStream.__iter__` is executed. In either case it is executed inside a daemonic process and cannot spawn further processes. Please let me know if I misunderstand your suggestion.\r\n\r\nTo avoid switching from daemonic to non-daemonic processes (for which the user must manually take care that they are correctly terminated on program termination), we may expose the already existing process pool to the user? (I'm not yet sure if this would lead to other issues) Alternatively we may provide an API where users can register their intent to use a process-pool and gluon-nlp may create the pool within the main process and pass the handle to the daemonic subprocess running `DatasetStream.__iter__`. Finally there may be an easy way to work around any issues caused by switching to non-daemonic processes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/493101377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2346731179,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0NjczMTE3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2346731179","actor":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T14:53:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2346731181,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDY3MzExODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2346731181","actor":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T14:53:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2346731184,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0NjczMTE4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2346731184","actor":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T14:53:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2346731186,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDY3MzExODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2346731186","actor":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"nod

for the clarification @zhreshold. In that case your proposed `MultiProcessingReadyDatasetStream` would expose an interface that would allow users to submit tasks to sibling processes during the execution of `DatasetStream.__iter__`?\r\n\r\nI'd also like to add an orthogonal perspective: Besides using multiprocessing inside the `DatasetStream.__iter__` we may parallelise multiple calls to `DatasetStream.__iter__`. Currently we can only prefetch a single element from the `DatasetStream` in a single worker process (or thread). If multiple elements can be prefetched in parallel (possibly in different processes) we may achieve the same improved user-experience (lower latency).\r\nThis is currently not possible as `DatasetStream` is a Stream / python iterator and we can only access the next upcoming element. To retrieve multiple elements, eg. for distributing them to multiple processes for further processing, we have to call `next()` multiple times. But as `DatasetStream.__iter__` returns Dataset objects, each call to `next()` is expensive and in @eric-haibin-lin's case too slow.\r\nInstead of directly constructing a Dataset on each call to `next()`, it may be sensible to work with [Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises). Since Python 2 is in the process of being deprecated (though no concrete plan is made for GluonNLP yet), we may consider building on https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html or https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html when addressing this problem. This may allow using existing standard library code and keeping our API simple. Thus, a call to `next()` would create a task and submit it to a pool of processes, but would not block calling `next()` again to begin computation for the following element.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/494713482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2358559421,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM1ODU1OTQyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2358559421","actor":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-22T08:49:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2358559422,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNTg1NTk0MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2358559422","actor":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-22T08:49:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2358559425,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM1ODU1OTQyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2358559425","actor":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-22T08:49:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2358559428,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNTg1NTk0Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2358559428","actor":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_
