have investigated into this. It's true that d2lbook is easy to use. It has a [building pipeline](https://book.d2l.ai/develop/pipeline.html) including compiling notebooks, building html and deploying on S3, only with few commands. The configurations are also easy to maintain in config.ini instead of conf.py. But, for using d2lbook in gluon-nlp, I have following two concerns. \r\n\r\n1. d2lbook is not stable enough to use. I tried to use d2lbook-0.1.16 and d2lbook-0.1.17 to build website for gluon-nlp repository, they all failed because of the current documentation structure, which means we need to either refactor our current documentation file structure to fit d2lbook or modify the code in d2lbook to fit our structure. It takes efforts. \r\n\r\n2. I have built the CI workflow to build website and deploy website for developer preview in #1327 , which fit our current documentation well. \r\n\r\nMaybe, we can still use current workflow to build our website.
