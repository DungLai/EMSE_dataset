Each training sample has multiple embeddings, but CSRNDArray only supports 2-dimensions. Should I forgo using Gluon's DataLoader entirely and instead construct my own batches using CSRNDArray's concat method, reshaping it back into individual samples after the embedding layer?

@charlieyou, indeed you need to \"flatten\" to 2D and reshape back to 3D. For efficiency, you likely want to pad each training sample in a batch to have the same number of embeddings. For the \"pad\" embeddings, the CSRNDArray can simply contain a completely empty row.\r\n\r\nIf you feel this work could be supported by some GluonNLP API, you would be very welcome to contribute such helper function.\r\n\r\nBtw, instead of the SkipGram training code snippet linked above (https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/879#issuecomment-522349864), this one is more
