I agree that it's a bit messy to leave a bunch of these files around. About deleting them, since in GluonNLP we use file hash check to avoid repeated downloads, if these files already exist, it should allow them to run faster. This is why we didn't try to clean the files in the `make test` target. If users want to clean them, we have a `make clean` target to clean up all files that are not tracked by git.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, I propose:\r\n- making sure that data files produced by tests only exist in `tests/data` and `tests/externaldata` folders.\r\n- once the above is done, if we feel necessary, we can also make a specific target for cleaning up these test data.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/508619705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2461628152,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ2MTYyODE1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2461628152","actor":{"login":"forresti","id":2020010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjAwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2020010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti","html_url":"https://github.com/forresti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-05T03:44:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2461628153,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NjE2MjgxNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2461628153","actor":{"login":"forresti","id":2020010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjAwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2020010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti","html_url":"https://github.com/forresti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-05T03:44:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/508631089","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/815#issuecomment-508631089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/815","id":508631089,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODYzMTA4OQ==","user":{"login":"forresti","id":2020010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjAwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2020010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti","html_url":"https://github.com/forresti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forresti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T05:09:42Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T05:09:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@szha
