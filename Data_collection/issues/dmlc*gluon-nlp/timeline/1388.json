The custom pass in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/v0.10.x/scripts/bert/bertpass_gpu.cc uses some custom code that @MoisesHer and I worked on post-1.7.0 release that eventually became the default in 1.8.0. Thanks to this collaboration, in 1.8 all [lines 30-248](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/v0.10.x/scripts/bert/bertpass_gpu.cc#L33-L248) have been integration into [lib_api.h](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/1.8.0.rc1/include/mxnet/lib_api.h#L545-L580) so they can be removed from bertpass_gpu.cc.\r\n\r\nPlus, we eliminated the extra step of taking the symbol_json string and converting it to a graph object in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/3fbe9619d9e68bc665f73c8cdf683213c6edd4d6/scripts/bert/bertpass_gpu.cc#L251-L262\r\nSo now the API will be simplified to:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/cc4b8ec68b6ec9dae73046e9c34ac97439efda83/example/extensions/lib_pass/pass_lib.cc#L34-L35\r\n```\r\nMXReturnValue myPass(mxnet::ext::Graph *g,\r\n                     const std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& options) {\r\n```\r\nSo little things like changing how you loop over the nodes in the graph from:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/3fbe9619d9e68bc665f73c8cdf683213c6edd4d6/scripts/bert/bertpass_gpu.cc#L266\r\nwill need to be changed to: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/cc4b8ec68b6ec9dae73046e9c34ac97439efda83/example/extensions/lib_subgraph/subgraph_lib.cc#L308-L309\r\n```\r\n  for(int i=0; i<graph->size(); i++) {\r\n    mxnet::ext::Node* n = graph->getNode(i);\r\n```\r\nAnd creating new nodes from:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/3fbe9619d9e68bc665f73c8cdf683213c6edd4d6/scripts/bert/bertpass_gpu.cc#L280\r\nto:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/cc4b8ec68b6ec9dae73046e9c34ac97439efda83/example/extensions/lib_subgraph/subgraph_lib.cc#L315\r\n```\r\nNode* input = graph->addNode(n->name + \"_input\", \"null\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nMostly just little things like this. But this should be a lot of change for the better.
