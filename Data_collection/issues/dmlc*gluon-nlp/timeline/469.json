You can record the length of each sample as a variable, `valid_length` when preparing the data. Then you can build a mask tensor with this variable, usually the mask contains 0 and 1.  For example, the position of the padding corresponds to a mask of 0.  Finally, you can multiply the result of the network output by mask to reduce the effect of padding.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the variable of the length record is `valid_length`(batch_size, ) , the result of lstm output is `lstm_output` (seq_len, batch_size,  nhiddens), and the maximum length of a batch of data padding is `seq_len`.\r\n```python\r\nmask = nd.broadcast_lesser(nd.arange(seq_len, ctx=valid_length.context).reshape((1, -1)),\r\n                                       valid_length.reshape((-1, 1)))\r\n# mask : (seq_len, batch_size, 1)\r\nmask = nd.expand_dims(nd.transpose(mask, axes=(1, 0)), axis=2)\r\n# do the mask operate\r\nlstm_output = lstm_output * mask\r\n```\r\nAlthough this does not really handle the variable sequence length, it is currently a simple and effective method.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/450500350/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vanewu","id":27672489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjcyNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27672489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu","html_url":"https://github.com/vanewu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanewu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2048121206,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA0ODEyMTIwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2048121206","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-29T15:29:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2048121207,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNDgxMjEyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/events/2048121207","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-29T15:29:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/comments/450502190","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/469#issuecomment-450502190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/469","id":450502190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDUwMjE5MA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-29T15:58:50Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T14:56:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@kenjewu got it, Thank you so much for your quick answer !
