As a result, user may experience dejavu.\r\n  - Recommendation: wrap these duplicate parts into functions, introduce them once in GNMT notebook, and reuse the function.\r\n- Length. The machine translation notebooks are very long. This is partly due to the duplicate problem. However, trying to cover many things in one place contributes to it too.\r\n  - Recommendation: split the notebook into two parts. One is for using pre-trained models and can focus on inference. Then create a separate notebook to include **simplified** training logic. At the end, refer users to the model zoo in which full-fledged training scripts can be found.\r\n- Lack of explanation. The writing around the code blocks doesn't provide enough help for new users to go through the code.\r\n  - Recommendation: treat tutorials as an opportunity for users to understand how to use the API by providing meaningful comments and description on the functionality.\r\n- Lack of links to API.\r\n  - Recommendation: notebooks should be link-rich so that users can easily refer to the API documentation when trying to understand what the code does.","closed_by":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
