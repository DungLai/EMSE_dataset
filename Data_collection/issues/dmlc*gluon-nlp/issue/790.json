I'd like to use this thread to make explicit decision about this, and about how we change APIs in the 0.x version. I propose the following:\r\n- GluonNLP project API adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).\r\n- Model Zoo scripts are not shipped as part of the API and thus does not adhere to semantic versioning.\r\n- In the 0.x versions, we add deprecation warning to any API or argument in API \r\n\r\nFor pre-trained models the semantic versioning is more nuanced. I propose the following:\r\n- Pre-trained models should support explicit versioning so that the `get_model` API always returns the same model with the same behavior when version is explicitly specified.\r\n- We can continue to use the file hash as the pre-trained model version. Each model version should have descrption about:\r\n  - the commit hash of GluonNLP based on which the model is trained.\r\n  - the script, dataset and hyperparameter settings.\r\n  - if converted from elsewhere, the source where the model comes from along with the license.\r\n- When getting pre-trained models by simply specifying pre-trained flag to be True, the model does not follow semantic versioning so that models could be updated.","closed_by":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/790/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
