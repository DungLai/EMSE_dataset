In fairseq, the keys/values both before and after linear projection are memorialized, but in gluon-nlp, only the keys/values before the linear projection is memorialized. This difference leads to different execution number of FC operators (In [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/0dfd6b624081fc4e1c72fc74ae0cd2de199c334c/fairseq/modules/multihead_attention.py#L263-L281), keys/values are directly pulled from prev_keys/prev_values; In [gluon-nlp](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/5d4bc9eba7226ea9f9aabbbd39e3b1e886547e48/src/gluonnlp/models/transformer.py#L721-L724), two more linear projections are needed to get the projectioned keys/values). We may need to correct the gluon-nlp's implementation of incremental decoding. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
