According to the function, step will be (31 // 8 = 3), so that the tensor will be split into 8 tensors of size [3, 3 ,3 ,3 ,3 ,3, 3, 10], in which the last tensor is extremely large. A better result could be [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]\r\n\r\nIn many cases, we will have a batch size for model, for example, 32, and we wish each gpu to have a tensor of size 4. But within bucket sampler or in the last batch, it could be smaller, as exampled above, 31, then a tensor of size 10 can be to large in this case.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest to have step_size = ceil(size / num_slice), then the last slice will always be smaller. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n(Paste the complete error message, including stack trace.)\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n(If you developed your own code, please provide a short script that reproduces the error.
