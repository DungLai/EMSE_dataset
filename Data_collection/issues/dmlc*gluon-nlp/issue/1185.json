As I look into the errors, they appear to be some specific place, see error message below.\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\nPlease see these CI errors.\r\n\r\nIt seems that there are three types of errors and these errors repeat randomly:\r\n- wheel file cannot be downloaded\r\n- python file existence error\r\n- some baidu API error\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-1184/2/pipeline/\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-1179/4/pipeline/ \r\n\r\nhttps://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-1180/2/pipeline/\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-1180/3/pipeline/\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-1180/6/pipeline/\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-1180/7/pipeline/\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-1180/8/pipeline/\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n(Paste the commands you ran that produced the error.)\r\n\r\n1. It seems that these errors have no relationship with what codes I commit. So they can be reproduced randomly.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n## What have you tried to solve it?\r\n\r\n1.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nWe recommend using our script for collecting the diagnositc information.
