We have two problems below regarding text pre-processing:\r\n\r\n1. For a few use cases like QA and BERT pre-training, the text pre-processing overhead is noticeable. Speed can be improved.\r\n2. Deploying gluon-nlp code to jave/scala/c++ requires rewring text processing code in the corresponding language  \r\n\r\nTo address **problem 1**, we can probably start to explore defining string operator interfaces by leverage the `str` support in [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/pysupported.html#str), and [nvstrings](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/nvstrings/stable/) for GPU enabled accleration. The APIs can serve as the pre-cursor of the official string operator API in MXNet for better deployment support. \r\n\r\nWe can benchmark if these packages accelerate the use case of BERT to start with.
