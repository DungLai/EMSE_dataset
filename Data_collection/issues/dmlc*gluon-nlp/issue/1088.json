But we may not want to include some parameters to weight decay, e.g. layernorm. \r\nFor example, in [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/cc7051dc592802f501e8a6f71f8fb3cf9de95dc9/optimization.py#L65), they have a argument exclude_from_weight_decay. In the current [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.15/tensorflow/contrib/opt/python/training/weight_decay_optimizers.py#L108), they implement a DecoupledWeightDecayExtension class to inherit from and specified it as decay_var_list.\r\nI did not see if we have such a choice, do you guys think it is necessary do add it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- list reference and related literature\r\n- list known implementations\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zburning","id":26197318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTk3MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26197318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning","html_url":"https://github.com/zburning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zburning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
