Part of the code is shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ctx = arrays[0].context\r\n    total_norm = ndarray.add_n(*[_norm(arr).as_in_context(ctx) for arr in arrays])\r\n    total_norm = ndarray.sqrt(total_norm)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the size of many NLP models is too large to fit into a single context, e.g. Transformers. Therefore it maybe good to add support of gradient clipping on multiple contexts when the model parameters are split onto multiple GPUs. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
