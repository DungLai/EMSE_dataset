For example, for a sequence like\r\n\r\n```\r\n[CLS] Manhattan is the core of New York City.[SEP][PAD][PAD][PAD]\r\n```\r\nThe corresponding `valid_candidates` tokens should be like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n01111111110000\r\n```\r\nIn short, `valid_candidates` mask out tokens like `[CLS]` `[SEP]` and `[PAD]`. Current implementation of `valid_candidates` is wrong. It will always output sequences with all `1`s.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the initialization of `valid_candidates` is wrong, as in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/master/scripts/pretraining/pretraining_utils.py#L497\r\n```\r\n valid_candidates = F.np.ones_like(input_ids, dtype=np.bool)\r\n```\r\n`valid_candidates` is initialized to be all 1s. When doing subsequent operations, the value will never change.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nWe recommend using our script for collecting the diagnositc information. Run the following command and paste the outputs below:\r\n```\r\ncurl --retry 10 -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/master/tools/diagnose.py | python\r\n\r\n# paste outputs here\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
