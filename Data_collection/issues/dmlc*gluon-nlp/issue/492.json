Shall we introduce a BERTVocab class which inherit from the normal Vocab class with a few extra properties:\r\n- mask_token\r\n- sep_token\r\n- cls_token\r\nThis way we replace all string literals with these attributes and make the code more maintainable in case we want to introduce more special tokens for pre-training.
