Let's use this issue to discuss approach and challenges for reproducing the large transformer-based models such as GPT-2 (#592), BigBird (MT-DNN) (#633), ERNIE, as well as exploring their limits. We can also use this thread to track and pool resources that people find.\r\n\r\n## Data\r\n- The biggest challenge in reproducing GPT-2 is in curating the data. There are some efforts in the open source community (e.g. [this one](https://github.com/eukaryote31/openwebtext)) though it's unclear how far these efforts have gone.\r\n- There are good corpora out there such as STORIES #598, resources in WMT2019.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/638/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
