We need such an interface so that:\r\n1. utilities can build on these interfaces.\r\n2. we can have a unified sequence to sequence model with pluggable encoder decoder, which speeds up development.\r\n3. existing models can adopt the same interface for better interchangeable use.\r\n\r\nWe avoided the temptation of proposing a design first, and rather chose to wait until we have enough use cases. Now seems to be a good time to revisit this discussion.\r\n\r\nGood starting points are the ones in sockeye, and the more simplified one in our https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/nmt.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/265/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
