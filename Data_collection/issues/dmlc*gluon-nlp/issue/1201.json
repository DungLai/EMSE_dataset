I have installed the following package:\r\n\r\nmxnet-cu100              1.6.0b20191102 \r\n\r\nhttps://pypi.org/project/mxnet-cu100mkl/#history\r\n\r\nAs it seems like the only one that has mxnet 1.6.0 and supports cuda 10. I have no possibility to upgrade to cuda 10.1 which has the official release for mxnet 1.6.0\r\n\r\nThe error I get looks like I am still on mxnet 1.5.0 but:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nprint(mx.__version__)\r\n\r\n1.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the pre-release is not compatible?
