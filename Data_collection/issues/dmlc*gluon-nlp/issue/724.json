Specifically, if I do \r\n```\r\nkill $PARENT_PID\r\n```\r\nI will observe that the parent process exits, and that child process still runs. And the child process runs till https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/master/src/gluonnlp/data/stream.py#L265-L271 and block there because the parent never calls `__next__`. \r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused because the process is already marked as daemon=True, but it does not exit.
