I came across SplitSampler that virtually partitions the data and randomly samples from a particular partition. I would like to use this partitioning mechanism with other samplers such as bucket sampler, etc. Would it be possible to configure the choice of sampling mechanism in SplitSampler rather than forcing it to be randomly sampled?\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/_modules/gluonnlp/data/sampler.html\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
