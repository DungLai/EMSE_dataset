It is divided by `args.log_interval` to compute the loss during the interval. It is inconsistent with the loss metric used in `train_transformer` script. In the latter script, losses and valid lengths during the interval are summed up separately. The average loss is computed from `interval_loss/interval_valid_length`.\r\n\r\nAlthough these two computations are similar, I think it will be better to unify them in training scripts.\r\n\r\n## Log Message\r\nI print out the log message here:\r\n```\r\n2020-01-08 07:00:24,259 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 100/1043] loss=6.2948, ppl=541.7368, gnorm=0.7030, throughput=36.26K wps, wc=606.57K\r\n2020-01-08 07:00:37,441 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 200/1043] loss=5.7232, ppl=305.8789, gnorm=0.3394, throughput=44.32K wps, wc=584.18K\r\n2020-01-08 07:00:50,411 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 300/1043] loss=5.2613, ppl=192.7247, gnorm=0.3442, throughput=45.71K wps, wc=592.78K\r\n2020-01-08 07:01:03,364 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 400/1043] loss=4.9213, ppl=137.1854, gnorm=0.3193, throughput=44.10K wps, wc=571.26K\r\n2020-01-08 07:01:16,174 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 500/1043] loss=4.6531, ppl=104.9109, gnorm=0.3304, throughput=43.29K wps, wc=554.48K\r\n2020-01-08 07:01:28,367 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 600/1043] loss=4.4185, ppl=82.9729, gnorm=0.3167, throughput=44.80K wps, wc=546.26K\r\n2020-01-08 07:01:41,019 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 700/1043] loss=4.3236, ppl=75.4571, gnorm=0.3128, throughput=44.82K wps, wc=566.96K\r\n2020-01-08 07:01:53,287 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 800/1043] loss=4.2010, ppl=66.7544, gnorm=0.3120, throughput=44.95K wps, wc=551.40K\r\n2020-01-08 07:02:06,260 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 900/1043] loss=4.0903, ppl=59.7581, gnorm=0.3177, throughput=44.53K wps, wc=577.61K\r\n2020-01-08 07:02:19,849 - root - [Epoch 0 Batch 1000/1043] loss=4.0345, ppl=56.5169, gnorm=0.3055, throughput=43.28K wps, wc=588.16K\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"liuzh47","id":12567586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTY3NTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12567586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzh47","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
