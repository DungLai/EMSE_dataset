In theory it introduces extra overhead such as calling `nd.where`. We need to evaluate the performance impact (I assume it's relatively small) and change gluon nlp language models to hybrid blocks for ease of deployment if possible. It should not affect existing pre-trained models since the parameter structure won't change. \r\n\r\n@zheng-da @szha","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/259/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
