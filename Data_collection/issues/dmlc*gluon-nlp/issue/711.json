Below are my suggested ways to improve our tutorials or issues to address.\r\n\r\n1. At the beginning of each section, we should provide an overview of the context, problem, and method that we are going to cover. For example, the following section misses such information:\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/word_embedding/word_embedding_training.html\r\n\r\n2. Each tutorial should start with title and overview text, rather than code blocks:\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html\r\n\r\n3. Wrong level of title (shouldn't be listed on the left panel of tutorials):\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html#Hyperparameters-and-model-initialization\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html#Data-pipeline\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html#Training\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html#Practice\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html#Conclusion\r\n\r\n4. Provide illustrations before ANY code block or after ANY title, rather than illustrate the idea in the title. For example,\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/language_model/language_model.html\r\n\r\n5. Avoid big code blocks. It would make it harder for readers to understand the tutorial if the reader needs to understand a big chunk of code at a time. It is usually a nice idea to break a big code block into small pieces (modularization). For example, code block 11 of\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/machine_translation/gnmt.html\r\nlooks intimidating.\r\n\r\n6. Avoid big code output, such as output of the aforementioned code block 11 in Point 5. \r\n\r\n7. Be consistent. \r\n\r\n7.1. Always add accents around code segments, such as `BeamSearchScorer` (not BeamSearchScorer) in the Practice section of http://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sequence_sampling/sequence_sampling.html\r\n\r\n7.2. Always capitalize the first letters of each title.\r\nhttp://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html# needs fix in its title.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/711/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
