This will help users train + deploy models with AWS.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we covered:\r\n- Huggingface/Transformer-based backbone with FP32 + FP16 training / inference. For FP16 training, we are not profiling against the AMP-based solution so this gives an edge of pytorch, in which we need to fix\r\n- MXNet 2.0-nightly version (only for community use) + GluonNLP 1.0 with FP32 + FP16 (amp) training / inference.\r\n- TVM FP32 inference. Due to some recent upgrade of the code base, this is currently broken.\r\n\r\nI will share the following action items that I feel are worthwhile doing:\r\n\r\n### Short-term Bug-fix + Improvement\r\n- [ ] Fix the FP16 training benchmark in Huggingface/Transformer to use AMP in PyTorch\r\n- [ ] Fix the TVM benchmark. This is also tracked in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1425\r\n- [ ] Add FP16 inference to TVM benchmark.\r\n- [ ] Turn on einsum acceleration in MXNet-based benchmark. This is added in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18921\r\n\r\n### Automation + Visualization\r\n- [x] Support launching benchmark job with AWS Batch. Currently tracked in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/1471.\r\n- [ ] Automate benchmarking process via Github actions.\r\n- [ ] Support visualization of benchmark results\r\n\r\n### Longer-term Backbone Benchmarking Effort\r\n- [ ] Add JAX/flax-based solution, which is internally using XLA.\r\n- [ ] Support AutoScheduler in TVM benchmark\r\n- [ ] Enable ONNX + TensorRT. This is considered the fastest solution for conducting NLP inference.\r\n\r\n### Other longer-term efforts\r\n- [ ] Support benchmarks for Data-loaders.\r\n- [ ] Support common end-to-end training benchmarks like the SQuAD 2.0 finetuning. We may focus on single-instance-based benchmarks.\r\n\r\n@dmlc/gluon-nlp-committers ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
