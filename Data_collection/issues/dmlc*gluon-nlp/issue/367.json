Currently, vocab requires an exact match to match a word to its index, and thus such back-off cannot be directly supported.\r\n\r\nOne option in implementing it is to just add a flag to support lower-case backoff. However, this interface doesn't generalize to other unknown input backoff methods. One more general solution is to use something similar to what fast-text subword embedding is using, which is to provide a look-up function.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
