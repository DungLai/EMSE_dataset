For example, in `train_gnmt.py`, the metric is computed with the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nloss = loss_function(out, tgt_seq[:, 1:], tgt_valid_length - 1).mean()\r\nloss = loss * (tgt_seq.shape[1] - 1) / (tgt_valid_length - 1).mean()\r\n```\r\nCurrent Mxnet `metric.loss` does not support length normalization. It will be great to add length normalized metric in the api.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/metric.py#L1661\r\n- https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/master/scripts/machine_translation/train_gnmt.py\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"liuzh47","id":12567586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTY3NTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12567586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzh47","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzh47/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1094/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
