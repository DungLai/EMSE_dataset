We will no longer need to worry about the `hybrid_forward` and can directly use `forward` to write the logic! This will help accelerate the model development.\r\n\r\nPost this merge, we will need to verify again our existing scripts:\r\n\r\n- [x] [Question Answering](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/question_answering) (I will do it in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/1405) \r\n- [x] [NLP Backbone Benchmark](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/benchmarks) (I will do it in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/1405) \r\n- [x] [Machine Translation](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/machine_translation) (@xinyual @sxjscience)\r\n- [ ] [BERT MLM + SOP Pretraining](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/pretraining/bert) (@xinyual @leezu)\r\n- [x] [ELECTRA Pretraining](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/pretraining) (@szha)\r\n- [x] [Generation Example](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/generation) (@szha)\r\n- [x] [Conversion Scripts](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/conversion_toolkits) (@szha)\r\n\r\n@szha @szhengac @barry-jin @leezu ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
