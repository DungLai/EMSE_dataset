Thus, we may try to support multiple-backends for the model-zoo in GluonNLP. As long as the backend supports numpy-like interface, e.g., [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) , [tf.experimental.numpy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), and the ongoing effort in PyTorch: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38349, we are able to reuse most of the [existing model implementations](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/src/gluonnlp/models) and make it work for different DL frameworks. One advantage is that the user is able to try out TF-2.0, Jax and PyTorch very easily.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @dmlc/gluon-nlp-committers ","closed_by":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
