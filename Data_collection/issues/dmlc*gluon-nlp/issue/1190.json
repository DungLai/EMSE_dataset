If this project requires the nightly builds for CI validation, please make sure that your CI pipeline now takes the nightly builds from https://dist.mxnet.io/python. Furthermore, as MXNet [1.7](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16864) and [2.0](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167) are currently in progress simultaneously, we are releasing nightly builds for both 1.x and 2.x. Take `mxnet-cu102` for example:\r\n\r\nIf you need the nightly builds for 1.x:\r\n```\r\npip install --pre \"mxnet-cu102<2\" -f https://dist.mxnet.io/python\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need the nightly builds for 2.x:\r\n```\r\npip install --pre \"mxnet-cu102>=2\" -f https://dist.mxnet.io/python\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this issue if the necessary changes have been made, or If the project doesn't rely on MXNet nightly builds.
