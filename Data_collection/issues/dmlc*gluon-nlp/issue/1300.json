Profiling on a p3.16xlarge machine on AWS shows that each `__getitem__` method costs 2.4 micro second, whereas a regular dictionary `.get(key, defaultvalue)`  method on the same machine is around 120 nano second, so the current implementation is 20 times slower than the regular `dict` `get` operation. This operation along is taking about 50% of all processing time in our data pipeline.
