Also, we updated our benchmarking utility to support profiling the inference speed of TVM: https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/benchmarks. We can further improve our document.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Attach the benchmark numbers. (Good for beginners)\r\n- [ ] Add a tutorial about how to convert GluonNLP models to TVM and do inference. (Good for beginners)\r\n- [ ] Investigate the numerical issues triggered when converting ALBERT to TVM.
