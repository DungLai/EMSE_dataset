I tried it with the notebooks in https://github.com/sxjscience/AMLC2020-GluonNLP and find that this is easy to use. Basically, we just need to ensure that we are using the `.md` format for storing the notebook contents and all outputs are cleaned:\r\n\r\nUse the recent tutorial notebooks as an example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sxjscience/AMLC2020-GluonNLP.git\r\ncd AMLC2020-GluonNLP\r\njupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --to markdown */*.ipynb\r\nsed -i 's/```python/```{.python .input}/g'  */*.md\r\ncd 02_text_prediction\r\nd2lbook build html\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne problem is that the additional files like `squad_utils.py` cannot be added in the notebook.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about adopting d2lbook? @leezu @barry-jin @szha","closed_by":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
