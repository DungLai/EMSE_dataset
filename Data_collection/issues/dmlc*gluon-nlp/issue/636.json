In some case, this package installation fails because when this package is installed via `pip install`, the latest numpy seen in the gluonnlp is installed first. However, the latest numpy version is outer the version specified by mxnet. Since dependencies in a python package are not installed in the order specified in the setup.py, it can not be solved by the ordering the dependencies to install mxnet first.\r\n\r\nI am trying to replicate the environment where I have this issue. However, I can't reproduce it successfully every time. Please let me know what you think.
