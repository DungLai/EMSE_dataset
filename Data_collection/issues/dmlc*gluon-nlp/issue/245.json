Users anyways need a line `mask = mask.as_in_context(ctx)` which could then just be replaced by `mask = data != vocab[vocab.padding_token]`. However, I'd also be ok with chaning the `LanguageModelDataset.bptt_batchify()`.\r\n  - `LanguageModelStream.bptt_batchify()` is smart and never includes `<eos>` in the data batch but only in the target  batch.\r\n  - `LanguageModelDataset.bptt_batchify()` instead assumes the data doesn't contain `<bos>` but only `eos`.\r\n  - See https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/blob/master/gluonnlp/data/stream.py#L415\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@cgraywang @szha @eric-haibin-lin ","closed_by":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
