Many functions process train and val together, and test data is evaluated during training...\r\nFor development, the users need to separate the two modes, which require proper saving/loading (including param, config, vocab etc.), refactored data processing/loading to make sure training and testing are consistent.\r\nIt would be nice if the seq2seq modules are organized in separate training, testing, and interactive evaluation (the current text_generation modules).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- list reference and related literature\r\n- list known implementations\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/871/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
