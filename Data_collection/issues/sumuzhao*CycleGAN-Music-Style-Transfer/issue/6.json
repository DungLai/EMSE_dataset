Here is some problem happened:\r\n\r\n1. It is easy to transfer drum pattern from one genre to another. However, it's really hard to transfer guitar and bass track. the problem would be like chord variation is almost unlimited, and it's relatively easier to transfer drum pattern. \r\n2. even though lambda is set to be 10 (cycle consistency loss parameter), the output of cycle_midi still can't not transfer B->A back in guitar and bass. \r\n\r\nDo you have any idea to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nyour work is really interesting, thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
