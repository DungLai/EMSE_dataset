This will return a midi file (cycle, transfer) for each individual numpy array, which will of course only be a few seconds in length each. Is there code for combining midi files? I assume this must have been done for the examples given where full songs are converted.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
