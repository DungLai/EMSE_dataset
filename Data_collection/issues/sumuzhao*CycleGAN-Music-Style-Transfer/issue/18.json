I used your code midi cleaning, time signature selection and so on. \r\nFinally before split a training and testing set, I have 24232 classic npy, 13286 jazz npy and 25995 pop nay files. That's too much compared to the npy dataset you offer. I don't know where I'm wrong. Could you please show me the script you used of generate  training and testing spy file?\r\n\r\nBest regards","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
