Multiple tracks would be way more difficult than single track. This is also what we can extend in this model. I suggest you could first use two tracks, one is drum and the other is guitar or just merge all other tracks. Regarding the starGAN, you'd better also try single merged track first then use multiple tracks. it's easier to control a single variant. Normally, the model should work well in a single track. \r\n\r\nCurrently, I don't have time to do any further work on this project. But feel free to contact me if you have any further questions. Good luck!
