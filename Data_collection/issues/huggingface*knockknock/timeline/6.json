I'm facing the exact same issue now on my AWS EC2 instance.\r\n\r\nI was initially getting prompted the following when my train job completed:\r\n`please enter password for encrypted keyring:`\r\n\r\nThis is pretty inconvenient and defeats the purpose of the notifications since I'll only get the start and end notifications if I am logged into the instance and I see this prompt and enter the keyring password.\r\n\r\nSo I disabled keyring by running `keyring --disable` and hoped that I won't get prompted the above message again. Now I instead get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(pytorch_p36) [ec2-user@<my ip and dir path>]$ python testing_kk.py \r\nPassword for <myemail@gmail.com>: \r\nSave username and password in keyring? [y/n]: y\r\nPassword for <myemail@gmail.com>: \r\nSave username and password in keyring? [y/n]: y\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter doing the above, I get the email notifications for both train start and finish. I'm guessing the password is prompted twice because it needs to send two emails.\r\n\r\nCan you please re-open this issue and help?
