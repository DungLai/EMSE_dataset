I'm not really familiar with the libraries that handle this type of notification. Is it cross-platform or a specific code has to be developed for each os (mainly: linux, mac, windows)? So far, I've tried to make as simple as possible and to integrate it with what people already use independently of this library. It would be great if it supports the main OS.\r\n\r\nI'm also curious: how long are your training/tasks? I usually use knockknock for longer (at least a few hours) trainings so I like receiving something on my phone as I don't necessarily have my laptop with me.\r\n\r\nVictor","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/comments/546046053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"VictorSanh","id":16107619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16107619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorSanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2741791393,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc0MTc5MTM5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/events/2741791393","actor":{"login":"atakanyenel","id":7947572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7947572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel","html_url":"https://github.com/atakanyenel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-24T18:31:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2741791395,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NDE3OTEzOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/events/2741791395","actor":{"login":"atakanyenel","id":7947572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7947572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel","html_url":"https://github.com/atakanyenel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-24T18:31:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/comments/548583049","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/knockknock/issues/26#issuecomment-548583049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/26","id":548583049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODU4MzA0OQ==","user":{"login":"atakanyenel","id":7947572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7947572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel","html_url":"https://github.com/atakanyenel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atakanyenel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T21:49:08Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T
