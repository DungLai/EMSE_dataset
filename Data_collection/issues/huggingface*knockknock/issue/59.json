I even tried to change the width and height to no avail.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
