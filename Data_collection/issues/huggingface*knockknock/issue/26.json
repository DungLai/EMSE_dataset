You know the ones that pop up on upper right corner. I have a Mac but it can be extended by others with different OS's. It doesn't require any token info, maybe couple of configuration arguments , and can simply be called with `@desktop_sender()`.\r\n\r\nIt's not a hard task, there are already libraries for it , but nevertheless I would like to make the PR myself.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?","closed_by":{"login":"VictorSanh","id":16107619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16107619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorSanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/knockknock/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
