Next, I did `pip install knockknock`. This was successful.\r\n\r\nI created an appropriate Gmail account to send notifications, and then I created a script called `testing_kk.py` which contains the following code (removed the email addresses for privacy):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom knockknock import email_sender\r\n\r\n@email_sender(recipient_email=\"<my email address>\", sender_email=\"<sender email address>\")\r\ndef train_your_nicest_model(your_nicest_parameters):\r\n    return {'loss': 0.9} # Optional return value\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    train_your_nicest_model(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run the above code in the same environment, I get the following stack-trace:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"testing_kk.py\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    train_your_nicest_model(1)\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/knockknock/email_sender.py\", line 50, in wrapper_sender\r\n    yag_sender.send(recipient_email, 'Training has started ðŸŽ¬', contents)\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/yagmail/sender.py\", line 147, in send\r\n    self.login()\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/yagmail/sender.py\", line 246, in login\r\n    self._login(self.credentials)\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/yagmail/sender.py\", line 203, in _login\r\n    password = self.handle_password(self.user, password)\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/yagmail/sender.py\", line 209, in handle_password\r\n    return handle_password(user, password)\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/yagmail/password.py\", line 11, in handle_password\r\n    password = keyring.get_password(\"yagmail\", user)\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/keyring/core.py\", line 55, in get_password\r\n    return _keyring_backend.get_password(service_name, username)\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/keyring/backends/fail.py\", line 24, in get_password\r\n    raise RuntimeError(msg)\r\nRuntimeError: No recommended backend was available.

But that didn't seem to happen above.\r\n\r\nI tried running `pip install keyring` and it seems to have been installed already, so I'm unsure why it says the backend was unavailable at run-time.
