You can use the script `scripts/data_setup.sh` to download them and place them in a `data` folder.\r\n> \r\n> Other datasets are also expected to be in the `data` folder (see the paths in the configuration files `configs/*.json`).\r\n> For instance, we compile the CoNLL2012 coreference data using this script from AllenNLP: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/scripts/compile_coref_data.sh\r\n> It compiles the CoNLL2012 data, and dump the coreference annotations into a single file.\r\n> For NER CoNLL, it is basically the same data as coreference which have not been dumped into the same single file (we can probably do something quick to avoid this data duplication).\r\n> Concerning the ACE data, we pre-process them so that the Mention Detection data match a CoNLL-NER format and the Relation Extraction task match a CoNLL-SRL format. Both are saved in a `data/ace2005` folder.\r\n> \r\n> If you want to use other datasets, it seems coherent to place them in the `data` folder, and use (if not modify) the `dataset_readers` classes.\r\n> \r\n> Victor\r\n\r\nHi, \r\nI want to reproduce your NER result.
