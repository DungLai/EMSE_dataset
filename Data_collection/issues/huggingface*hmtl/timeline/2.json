You can use the script `scripts/data_setup.sh` to download them and place them in a `data` folder.\r\n\r\nOther datasets are also expected to be in the `data` folder (see the paths in the configuration files `configs/*.json`).\r\nFor instance, we compile the CoNLL2012 coreference data using this script from AllenNLP: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/scripts/compile_coref_data.sh\r\nIt compiles the CoNLL2012 data, and dump the coreference annotations into a single file.\r\nFor NER CoNLL, it is basically the same data as coreference which have not been dumped into the same single file (we can probably do something quick to avoid this data duplication).\r\nConcerning the ACE data, we pre-process them so that the Mention Detection data match a CoNLL-NER format and the Relation Extraction task match a CoNLL-SRL format. Both are saved in a `data/ace2005` folder.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use other datasets, it seems coherent to place them in the `data` folder, and use (if not modify) the `dataset_readers` classes.\r\n\r\nVictor","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/comments/441464085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"VictorSanh","id":16107619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16107619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorSanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/comments/442519176","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/hmtl/issues/2#issuecomment-442519176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/2","id":442519176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjUxOTE3Ng==","user":{"login":"Evpok","id":1656541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTY1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1656541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok","html_url":"https://github.com/Evpok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evpok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T16:49:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T16:49:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any

Hello, thanks for raising this question.\r\n> \r\n> We used pre-trained word embeddings (Glove and ELMo). You can use the script `scripts/data_setup.sh` to download them and place them in a `data` folder.\r\n> \r\n> Other datasets are also expected to be in the `data` folder (see the paths in the configuration files `configs/*.json`).\r\n> For instance, we compile the CoNLL2012 coreference data using this script from AllenNLP: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/scripts/compile_coref_data.sh\r\n> It compiles the CoNLL2012 data, and dump the coreference annotations into a single file.\r\n> For NER CoNLL, it is basically the same data as coreference which have not been dumped into the same single file (we can probably do something quick to avoid this data duplication).\r\n> Concerning the ACE data, we pre-process them so that the Mention Detection data match a CoNLL-NER format and the Relation Extraction task match a CoNLL-SRL format. Both are saved in a `data/ace2005` folder.\r\n> \r\n> If you want to use other datasets, it seems coherent to place them in the `data` folder, and use (if not modify) the `dataset_readers` classes.\r\n> \r\n> Victor\r\n\r\nHi, \r\nI want to reproduce your NER result. However,  I met a problem when I set up conll2012 data.\r\n\r\nI used this script https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/scripts/compile_coref_data.sh. But it warned that there is no .parse file in the folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ncould not find the gold parse [.//data/files/data/english/annotations/bc/cctv/00/cctv_0001.parse] in the ontonotes distribution ... exiting ...\r\n\r\ncat: 'conll-2012/v4/data/development/data/english/annotations/*/*/*/*.v4_gold_conll': No such file or directory\r\ncat: 'conll-2012/v4/data/train/data/english/annotations/*/*/*/*.v4_gold_conll': No such file or directory\r\ncat: 'conll-2012/v4/data/test/data/english/annotations/*/*/*/*.v4_gold_conll': No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @djshowtime in https://github.com/huggingface/hmtl/issues/2#issuecomment-481519182_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
