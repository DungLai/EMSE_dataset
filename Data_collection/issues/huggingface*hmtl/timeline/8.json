On my laptop, the whole preprocessing takes ~15mins (I use a standard MacBookPro, nothing fancy). So it's definitely surprising...\r\nHave you measured what operation take time? \r\nOne way to speed up the thing is to add a `disable=['parser', 'tagger', 'ner']` when calling spacy tokenizer. Note that I haven't tested it, nor optimized the script for time performance since it's a one time shot.\r\n\r\nThe main splits can be found [here](https://github.com/tticoin/LSTM-ER/tree/master/data/ace2005/split) (repo from Miwa and Bansal).\r\n\r\nThat said, the parameters seems good. I like to put `saving_path=<some_tmp_folder>` since as you noticed, the script produced individual preprocessed files (outputed in the conll format for convenience). The next step is fairly simple: read the splits files and copy them in train/dev/test folders.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir train\r\nfor i in `cat split/train`; do cp tmp/$i.sgm.like_conll train; done\r\n```\r\nFor coref training examples, I found it easier to dump everything in the same file:\r\n```bash\r\nfor i in `cat split/train`; do (cat \"tmp/${i}.sgm.coref\"; echo) >> single_file_train.gold_conll; done\r\n```\r\n(The last two snippets are bash commands).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/comments/457234263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"VictorSanh","id":16107619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16107619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorSanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/comments/457912655","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/hmtl/issues/8#issuecomment-457912655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/8","id":457912655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzkxMjY1NQ==","user":{"login":"parap1uie-s","id":23453851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDUzODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23453851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s","html_url":"https://github.com/parap1uie-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parap1uie-s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-27T12:13:17Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T12:13:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nIt
