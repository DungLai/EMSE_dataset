Then it is pretty much just replacing the dataset paths in the config files and call `fine_tune.py` (and probably some minor parameters to add such as the pre-trained weights to fine-tune).\r\n2/ You implement a `DatasetReader` (see `hmtl/dataset_readers`) that support your dataset format and modify the config file to call this specific dataset reader type (and then call `fine_tune.py`, it should be seamless once you add another dataset reader).\r\n\r\nVictor","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/comments/463252185/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"VictorSanh","id":16107619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16107619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorSanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/comments/463255912","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/hmtl/issues/10#issuecomment-463255912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hmtl/issues/10","id":463255912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzI1NTkxMg==","user":{"login":"VictorSanh","id":16107619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16107619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorSanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorSanh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T16:01:38Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T20:47:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Something to keep in mind is that the final return of the coreference module are the coreference clusters: in your example, there is one cluster {`Tom`, `He`}, but there could be more mentions in this cluster.
