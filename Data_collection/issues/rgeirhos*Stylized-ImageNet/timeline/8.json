I am concerned to reproduce the result that you showed in this paper that using stylized images can improve the original detection map, not the corrupted map. It seems like the other paper is concerning the robustness of detectors in corrupted scenes and using those styles cannot improve the original map. Is it using the texture provided in this github and use it to create stylized VOC that improves the original map? (I assume I may use some codes from the other github).
