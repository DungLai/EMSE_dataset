I understand that in the original paper, best results were achieved by training on IN + SIN and then finetuning on IN only. At what point would you suggest doing the finetuning? Is it after the AP for IN+SIN has started to level off or whilst it is still rising?\r\nI also plan to finetune at a greater resolution - maybe 448 x 448 - do you think I should do this after finetuning on IN only at 224 x 224 ?","closed_by":{"login":"rgeirhos","id":23079422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDc5NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23079422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos","html_url":"https://github.com/rgeirhos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgeirhos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rgeirhos/Stylized-ImageNet/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rgeirhos/Stylized-ImageNet/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
