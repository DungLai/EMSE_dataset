How do you encode this into heatmap? If valid is 0, it will be zero matrix? if it's 1 or 2, it will be heatmap with 1 peak? Am I right?\r\n> *\r\n\r\nHi, They use 2D Gaussian centered to generate heatmap.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/857436311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tucachmo2202","id":47667644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjY3NjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47667644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202","html_url":"https://github.com/tucachmo2202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
