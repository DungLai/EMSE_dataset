\r\n    Hi, I want to confirm something to you: 1)  box = [450, 160, 350, 560] is the example person box in your image(the image also contains more than one people); \r\n2) the function _box2cs and _xywh2cs are both defined by you?  extract the image part according to the box from the raw image, and then do some transform to get the final input?\r\nthanks!
