In End-to-End Faster & Mask R-CNN Baselines, the entry X-101-64x4d-FPN with 42.4 box AP can get 55.7 AP on person cat.

author let detector gives multiple detection boxes for every person instance(**rescore operation refer to COCO17-Keypoints-TeamOKS**). And rescore could amend pred results.\r\n- Then if we want to get multi bboxs, we can adjust NMS postprocess.\r\n- As long as the detector position is very correct like gt bbox, the prediction results are also very good. \r\n- Top-down methods, the detector is very import to improve preds results.\r\n- But I use multi bbox, preds results are worse. So I **guess** the author used the byte bboxs and the NMS operation together amend the detectors performance.\r\n- Other detectors:   maskrcnn-benchmark, yolov3. \r\n\r\nWelcome to Join pose forum
