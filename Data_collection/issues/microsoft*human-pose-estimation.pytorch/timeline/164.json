However, I don't highly recommend you, the two-stage model require a detector and it is not quick enough for realtime in mobile. Anyway, I haven't try it yet, so you can try for experience then let me know about the time. Thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/comments/822356515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tucachmo2202","id":47667644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjY3NjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47667644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202","html_url":"https://github.com/tucachmo2202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4611717701,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYxMTcxNzcwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/4611717701","actor":{"login":"yonatanbitton","id":26148975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTQ4OTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26148975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton","html_url":"https://github.com/yonatanbitton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-19T10:19:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4611717706,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MTE3MTc3MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/events/4611717706","actor":{"login":"yonatanbitton","id":26148975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTQ4OTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26148975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton","html_url":"https://github.com/yonatanbitton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonatanbitton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-19T10:19:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
