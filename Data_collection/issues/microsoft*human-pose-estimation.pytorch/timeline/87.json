I only changed code in pose_estimation/train.py.\r\n\r\nThat `init_weight` method only serves to init from pretrained model from **resnet** but not from the author's provided ones. If you step into that method you will find the parameter `pretrained` to be something like 'models/pytorch/resnet50-19c8e357.pth'. So the original code cannot resume training sessions.\r\n\r\nThe place where author load his mature model is in pose_estimation/valid.py. In [this line](https://github.com/Microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/ec2a78a2f4a74b994e27d1faf9e226deb37843fa/pose_estimation/valid.py#L121). I changed it so it applies to posetrack 17 's 15 joint result.\r\nThis is placed just after calling `get_pose_net` in train.py.\r\n```\r\n    if config.TEST.MODEL_FILE:  # train from pretrained model\r\n        logger.info('=> loading model from {}'.format(config.TEST.MODEL_FILE))\r\n        meta_info = torch.load(config.TEST.MODEL_FILE)\r\n        if 'pt17-epoch' in args.model_file:\r\n            # resume previous training\r\n            state_dict = OrderedDict({k.replace('module.', ''): v\r\n                                      for k, v in meta_info['state_dict'].items()})\r\n            config.TRAIN.BEGIN_EPOCH = meta_info['epoch']\r\n        else:\r\n            # if load from coco pretrained model，\r\n            logger.info('=> initialize from coco, so adjusting the last layer')\r\n            \r\n            model.final_layer = nn.Conv2d(256, 17, (1, 1), (1, 1))\r\n            state_dict = meta_info\r\n        \r\n        model.load_state_dict(state_dict)\r\n        \r\n        if not 'pt17-epoch' in args.model_file:  # if load from coco pretrained model\r\n            model.final_layer = nn.Conv2d(256, config.MODEL.NUM_JOINTS, (1, 1), (1, 1))\r\n            logger.info('=> adjust done.')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is just a part of the code so if there's anything confusing pls let me know. \r\n\r\nAlso just replacing the last layer with random one cannot get competitive result. My final PCKh on posetrack validation set is 88.01. But I use my trained model to run posetrack task 1 and only get 71 mAP. If you have better result pls tell
