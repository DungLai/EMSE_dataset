also have a doubt with GPU utilization...\r\nWhen transferring the joint coordinate to the gaussian map, we need to do N cycles (N is the number of joints) according to the function \"generate_target\" in lib/dataset/JointsDataset.py.\r\nSo the time complexity is huge and the GPU utilization may be low because most of the time is spent on generating pose ground truth.\r\nCould
