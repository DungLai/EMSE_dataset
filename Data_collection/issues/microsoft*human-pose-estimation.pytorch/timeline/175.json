The best way to sort this out is to keep that particular image outside the Val/Train folder and run the code again. For example: for Valid images. Instead of placing them inside /data/images/valid2017. Just keep it /data/images and then try. Try with 1 image and see if the same error occurs for the next image of the valid. Then you would understand. \r\n\r\nIt worked for me!
