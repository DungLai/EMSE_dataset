There needs to be a section specifically for Windows 10 users, and should have 2 sets of instructions for those that use Git-Bash or Mingw32/64, and those that use PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI personally use Git-Bash, and after 25 minutes here still have not been able to 'make' the library.\r\nIn my case:\r\n```\r\npalls@DEV MINGW64 /e/Projects/machine-learning/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/lib (master)\r\n$ make\r\ncd nms; python setup.py build_ext --inplace; rm -rf build; cd ../../\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"setup.py\", line 55, in <module>\r\n    CUDA = locate_cuda()\r\n  File \"setup.py\", line 52, in locate_cuda\r\n    raise EnvironmentError('The CUDA %s path could not be located in %s' % (k, v))\r\nOSError: The CUDA nvcc path could not be located in E:/Nvidia/GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.2\\bin\\nvcc\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is funny because from that same folder:\r\n```\r\npalls@DEV MINGW64 /e/Projects/machine-learning/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/lib (master)\r\n$ nvcc\r\nnvcc fatal   : No input files specified; use option --help for more information\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich clearly shows that nvcc is accessible, and therefore there are adequate env vars.\r\n```\r\npalls@DEV MINGW64 /e/Projects/machine-learning/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/lib (master)\r\n$ echo ${CUDAHOME}\r\n/e/Nvidia/GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of thing that causes users to abandon this and move on to another project.\r\nPlease address this.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/140/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
