Where should I place the image files and the annotation json of the subset I want to evaluate? What lines of code elsewhere should I modify?\r\n\r\nRight now, I have the following file structure inside ${POSE_ROOT}/data in which I have added the 'subsetA' folder with its corresponding images and annotations (in subsetA/annot/ there only exists a valid.json file the annotations).\r\n\r\ndata\r\n└── subsetA\r\n│   ├── annot\r\n ------------valid.json\r\n│   └── images\r\n------------(subsetA images are here)\r\n└── mpii\r\n    ├── annot\r\n    └── images\r\n\r\nSpecific instructions would be very helpful and greatly appreciated!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/65/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/65/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
