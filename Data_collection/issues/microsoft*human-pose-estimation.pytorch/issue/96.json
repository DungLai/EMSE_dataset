We also achieve slightly higher AP by using pre-trained ResNet with higher accuracy: https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/pose.html \r\n\r\nBesides, you mentioned in https://github.com/Microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/2 that the tracking code is implemented with MXNet. Do you think there's a chance that you will release it? GluonCV is also based on MXNet. With your tracking implementation as a starting point, we may provide a smooth and unified pipeline of pose tracking in GluonCV.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTong","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/96/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/96/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
