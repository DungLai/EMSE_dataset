The question is the inference size must be divisible by 64. Therefore, the shape of flow is not corresponding to the shape of images. In order to get the same results reported, I wonder how to solve this problem and the inference time for \"With Joint Propagation\" on posetrack2018 val dataset.\r\nThanks a lot!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/88/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/88/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
