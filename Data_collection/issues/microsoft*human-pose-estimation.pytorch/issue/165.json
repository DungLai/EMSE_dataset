With card geforce 940MX, time an image forward to model is about 0.009s but time for post processing is about 0.033s. How can I modify the post processing for reducing inference time (accept decrease accuracy and retrain model).\r\nThanks very much!","closed_by":{"login":"tucachmo2202","id":47667644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjY3NjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47667644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202","html_url":"https://github.com/tucachmo2202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tucachmo2202/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
