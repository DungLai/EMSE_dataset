It have very good results.I am curious about which your b**ounding box detector.** \r\n\r\nI evaluate your valided bbox results, it's get **56.8** performance in detection task, and I get **49.5** with maskrcnn detector. **Would you give your refered codes or repo, and have you train faster RCNN codes?**\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n[**MaskRCNN**](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/52/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/52/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
