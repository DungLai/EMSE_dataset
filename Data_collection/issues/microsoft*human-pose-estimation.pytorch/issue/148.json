I am implementing the pose estimation of something other than human. Do I still have to use the pixel_std=200? What would happen if my object is smaller than 200px?\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of the \"get_affine_transform\" function? from visualization, I can see that it aligns the center of the object with the image. but its dependency on 'scale' is something I am not able to understand. I would appreciate the help here.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
