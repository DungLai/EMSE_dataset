I read your paper. You said the  learning rate strategy  was different and other settings were the same as those in the training COCO part.\r\nI tried to finetune the model like what you said. But problem is COCO and Posetrack have 2 different keypoints -- \"**head_top**\" and \"**head_bottom**\" in posetrack, \"**left_eye**\", \"**right_eye**\" in COCO.\r\nBefore finetuning, I made a big COCO-format annotation file with those Posetrack json files. And I simply treated the \"head_top\" and \"head_bottom\" keypoints  as \"left_eye\", \"right_eye\". But it seemed like the model can't specify these 2 points very well.  \r\nSo can you tell me how you handle these 2 points?
