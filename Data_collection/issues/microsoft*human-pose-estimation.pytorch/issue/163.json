From COCO dataset, the valid of joint are 0 for not in the image, 1 for in the image but not visible, and 2 for in the image and visible. How do you encode this into heatmap? If valid is 0, it will be zero matrix? if it's 1 or 2, it will be heatmap with 1 peak? Am I right?\r\n\r\n2. The loss function when training, It's MSE between predicted heatmaps and targeted heatmaps according to the paper. Do I have to multiply with valid? or it's not needed?\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nThan","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
