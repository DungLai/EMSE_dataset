The simplest way to solve this problem is just installing cuda at the host, but i don't want that. \r\n\r\nIs there any tips to connect cuda in anaconda when running this codes??","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/issues/111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
