You have set the `Variable_Type` field as target for all the features. You should have just one target field and the rest should be set to `feature`. More info [here](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/scikit-learn.md#preparing-feature-definitions).\r\n\r\nBut there is another issue that you are scaling your target. If you're using classification the target should be a discrete value which we shouldn't need to scale. You can set the feature strategy as `none`. If it is a continuous variable you should be using regression.

Generally you should be scaling numerical data so that the model is not confused by features having different range of values. Keep it as `none` for your target, but change the rest to `scaling`.\r\n\r\nAlso, are all of your features really integers? For e.g. I would have expected CGPA to be a float. You'll need to provide the correct data types in the feature definitions table so that the SSE knows how to pre-process the data.
