The script installs the CPU version by default.\r\n\r\nThe demo app trains and tests 4 different neural networks. If you want to have a quicker demo for the training, you can just set up the app to train a single network. Simply remove the unwanted models from the `Estimators` and `Keras Architecture` tables in the load script under the `ML Config` section.\r\n\r\nThe testing is also time consuming due to walk forward validation, so you could reduce the test data as well. The app I've provided uses 6 months of test data. You can adjust the date range in the `Metrics & Predictions` section of the load script.\r\n\r\nFinally, I haven't tried installing the SSE on Linux without Docker. Is there a reason why you can't use Docker? You can simply run a single container with vanilla Docker without an orchestration tool, and it makes the setup very simple.
