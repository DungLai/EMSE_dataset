@Apostolis12,\r\n\r\nYou've hit the maximum limit for a single message which is set under `__main__.py` line 40:\r\n```\r\n# Set the maximum message length for gRPC in bytes\r\nMAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 10 * 1024 * 1024\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, instead of changing this limit, I'd first consider how your response got so large for a single bundle. The SSE breaks up the response into multiple bundles and a single bundle should usually not exceed the limit.\r\n\r\nIn the case of association rules, if you're getting a huge number of rules back, it may be because you have set the `min_support` too low and are getting back associations which aren't going to be very useful.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a closed issue and unrelated to this problem. So please raise a new issue if
