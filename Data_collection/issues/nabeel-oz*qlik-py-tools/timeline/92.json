Or use the `take_log=true` argument and also try adjusting the `changepoint_prior_scale` argument. One thing to note is that you don't have sufficient data to detect longer term seasonality, which is one of the useful features of Prophet.\r\n\r\nFor results similar to a linear regression you can use the `return=trend` argument with Prophet. Otherwise you'll need to look at the capabilities described under the Machine Learning and Deep Learning sections.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/593160823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/593310052","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/92#issuecomment-593310052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/92","id":593310052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MzMxMDA1Mg==","user":{"login":"hammamr","id":41787890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzg3ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41787890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr","html_url":"https://github.com/hammamr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammamr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-02T09:36:11Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T16:40:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello
