The code is trying to get classification metrics, but it looks like your target is a number rather than the discrete classes required for classification. So I suspect the problem is that you are using a classification estimator when you should be using a regression estimator.\r\n\r\nI also see that your target field is set as a string in the feature definitions but is actually a float. Using one hot encoding on this field will split it into multiple columns; one for each unique value, which is probably a mistake. Just leave the target as an int or float with the feature strategy as none, and frame your model as a regression problem. If you want to do classification you would convert this continuous variable into a discrete one, for example by bucketing the numeric values into fixed classes in Qlik.\r\n\r\nThe n_features input you are sending looks ok. The SSE breaks the input into multiple columns on the `|` delimiter and then converts data types based on the feature definitions you send to the model. The feature strategies such as scaling and one hot encoding are then applied which may result in a different number of columns than the input. You can see the transformations the data goes through by passing `debug=true` in the `ExecutionArgs`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/499826970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2396792943,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM5Njc5Mjk0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2396792943","actor":{"login":"HeinRique","id":19478251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc4MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19478251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique","html_url":"https://github.com/HeinRique","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-07T09:52:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2396792944,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzOTY3OTI5NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2396792944","actor":{"login":"HeinRique","id":19478251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc4MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19478251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique","html_url":"https://github.com/HeinRique","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-07T09:52:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/500420104","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/31#issuecomment-500420104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/31","id":500420104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDQyMDEwNA==","user":{"login":"HeinRique","id":19478251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc4MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19478251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique","html_url":"https://github.com/HeinRique","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-10T13:39:30Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T13:39:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

First of all, thank you for your support.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I've noticed that in your app \"_Git issue 31\", the \"Predict Dimension\" and \"Predict Measure\" wasn't working. After some changes, I realize that only \"Predict Dimension\" wasn't working. If you remove it from the table chart, you'll see that the measure one starts to work.\r\n\r\nOn my app test, both of them works just fine. So I tried to:\r\n- **Copy my measure to your app chart**: it was the same syntax. it didn't work.\r\n- **Copy my chart to your app**: the dimension one stop working.\r\n- **Check the load script**: the \"Feature Expression\" tab was identical. \r\n- **Load my data in your app**: after this, all the features worked. Dimension, Measure and Load Script.\r\n\r\nI don't know why it happened. I think that could be the size of data(?). Is it a real problem or not?\r\nThe SSE doesn't show any error, by the way.\r\n\r\nSo, for me, the py-tool is working and I really thank you for your help.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything you need to evaluate this weird behavior mentioned above, just let me know.\r\n\r\nNow I'll join this solution with my ETL model and see the magic!\r\n\r\nThank you, once again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/501764425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HeinRique","id":19478251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc4MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19478251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique","html_url":"https://github.com/HeinRique","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeinRique/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
