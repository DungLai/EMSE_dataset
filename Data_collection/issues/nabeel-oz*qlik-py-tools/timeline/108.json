Andy,\r\n\r\nFor the monthly granularity you're currently using the `Month` function which returns an integer. The Prophet function requires a datetime dimension so you'll need to use `MonthName`, `MonthStart` or `MonthEnd` instead. Also, your line chart seems to have the Year as a dimension. The chart to plot the forecast should take the form of one datetime dimension and multiple measures (actual, forecast, etc.).\r\n\r\nI'd recommend that you first build separate charts for monthly and daily forecasts to decide which granularity works best for your app. The measure for the monthly forecast may look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPyTools.Prophet(MonthName([Buchungsdatum]), (sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung)+sum({$<FSA = {EA10}>}Saldo_Buchung))/sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung), 'freq=M, return=yhat, debug=True')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the daily one like this:\r\n```\r\nPyTools.Prophet([Buchungsdatum], (sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung)+sum({$<FSA = {EA10}>}Saldo_Buchung))/sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung), 'freq=D, return=yhat, debug=True')\r\n```\r\n\r\nA drilldown dimension going from month to date won't work well for forecasting as selecting a month would generate predictions based on just one month of data, which won't be of much use. \r\n\r\nIf you want to calculate a daily forecast and roll it up to the monthly level, you could use a [time-aware](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/June2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Visualizations/time-aware-charts.htm) line chart with a continuous axis and let Qlik do the aggregation. You could also [pre-calculate the forecast through the Qlik load script](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/Prophet.md#precalculating-forecasts-in-the-load-script).\r\n\r\nBy the way, your value for `changepoint_prior_scale` is very high. I'd keep it close to the default value of `0.05` initially.\r\n\r\nNabeel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/687979354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/688423922","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/108#issuecomment-688423922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/108","id":688423922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODQyMzkyMg==","user":{"login":"labasmuse","id":61087143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDg3MTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61087143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse","html_url":"https://github.com/labasmuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-07T16:28:24Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T16:28:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Nabeel,\r\n\r\nI do like your project.

The chart to plot the forecast should take the form of one datetime dimension and multiple measures (actual, forecast, etc.).\r\n\r\nI'd recommend that you first build separate charts for monthly and daily forecasts to decide which granularity works best for your app. The measure for the monthly forecast may look like this:\r\n\r\nPyTools.Prophet(MonthName([Buchungsdatum]), (sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung)+sum({$<FSA = {EA10}>}Saldo_Buchung))/sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung), 'freq=M, return=yhat, debug=True')\r\n\r\nAnd the daily one like this:\r\n\r\nPyTools.Prophet([Buchungsdatum], (sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung)+sum({$<FSA = {EA10}>}Saldo_Buchung))/sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung), 'freq=D, return=yhat, debug=True')\r\n\r\nA drilldown dimension going from month to date won't work well for forecasting as selecting a month would generate predictions based on just one month of data, which won't be of much use.\r\n\r\nIf you want to calculate a daily forecast and roll it up to the monthly level, you could use a time-aware<https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/June2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Visualizations/time-aware-charts.htm> line chart with a continuous axis and let Qlik do the aggregation. You could also pre-calculate the forecast through the Qlik load script<https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/Prophet.md#precalculating-forecasts-in-the-load-script>.\r\n\r\nBy the way, your value for changepoint_prior_scale is very high. I'd keep it close to the default value of 0.05 initially.\r\n\r\nNabeel\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/108#issuecomment-687979354>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOSB3J5QV2NRIJGVMLDT64DSEQ57FANCNFSM4QS2U5TQ>.\r\n\r\n\r\nBDO AG, mit Hauptsitz in Zürich, ist die unabhängige, rechtlich selbstständige Schweizer Mitgliedsfirma des internationalen BDO Netzwerkes.\r\nBDO SA, dont le siège principal est à Zurich, est le membre suisse, juridiquement indépendant, du réseau international BDO.\r\nBDO SA, con sede principale a Zurigo, è una società giuridicamente indipendente e autonoma, membro della rete internazionale di aziende BDO.\r\nBDO Ltd, with its statutory seat in Zurich, is the legally independent Swiss member firm of the international BDO network.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/688423922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"labasmuse","id":61087143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDg3MTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61087143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse","html_url":"https://github.com/labasmuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labasmuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/689248565","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/108#issuecomment-689248565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/108","id":689248565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTI0ODU2NQ==","user":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-09T01:49:44Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T01:50:33Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hi Andy,\r\n\r\nThe image you posted doesn't show up on GitHub. You seem to be using MonthName in the measure, but MonthStart in the dimension. The function you use in the measure should match the dimension.\r\n\r\nThe future periods need to be added in a way that if you put your dimension and actual values (the measure part of the forecast expression) in a table you get one row for each month, will NULL values for the future months. The left join may not be doing what you expect. You could also use the forecasting calendar approach described in the documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/689248565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
