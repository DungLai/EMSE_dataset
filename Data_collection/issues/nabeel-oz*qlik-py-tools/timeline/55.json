post addresses the questions on your app. \r\n\r\n> What I have done so far: I have prepared my LOAD script and obtained the data model as shown below. It is not as what we expect actually. There is no link key available.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot you posted shows that the `temp` table still exists in your data model. In the sample app the `temp` table is used as input to the Prophet function and then dropped. The response from Prophet can be linked to your data model as demonstrated in the sample app. The link would be a concatenated key of the MonthYear, Customer Name, Products, etc. depending on the granularity of your forecast.\r\n\r\n> Part two is based on my own data and not the hospital attendance dataset. What happened is that I have encountered error as shown below\r\n\r\nThe error occurs because you have zero values in `y` and the `take_log` parameter set to `true`. A logarithm of zero results in negative infinity, which is not accepted by Prophet. You should use the default `take_log=false` option in this case.

@kutkin54 ,\r\nThe value of the measure for future periods should be NULL. \r\n\r\nIn the sample app's source I have set the measure to 'N/A' for future periods as you can see above.

, thank you for your reply. \r\n\r\nI have followed your advice and now encounter new error.

Unfortunately, the same outputs as shown above are obtained again. \r\n\r\nI provide you a view of my LOAD script below for your reference.
