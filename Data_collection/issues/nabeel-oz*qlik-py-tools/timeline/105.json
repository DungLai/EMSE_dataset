I'm not sure if I understood the second point of your post correctly.\r\n\r\nAssuming the model parameters are the same, the difference could be in the data split or how the confusion matrix is being calculated.\r\n\r\nWe are using K-fold cross validation in the sample app. The confusion matrix is built using results from the [sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict.html) method. \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Get cross validation predictions for the confusion matrix\r\ny_pred = cross_val_predict(self.model.pipe, self.X_train, y_train, cv=self.model.cv, fit_params=fit_params)\r\n```\r\nIn the app `cv` is set to 3. So this method splits the data into 3 different train and test sets, trains an estimator on each train set and returns predictions from each test set. Each sample ends up in the test set once.\r\n\r\nSo we can use the full training data to build the confusion matrix. I'm using the `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` method.\r\n\r\nTo calculate metrics using a hold-out dataset you can use the `PyTools.sklearn_Calculate_Metrics(model_name, n_features)` method. This is described [here](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/scikit-learn.md#training-and-testing-the-model).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNabeel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/656450397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3532144832,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUzMjE0NDgzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/3532144832","actor":{"login":"fedala56","id":68053040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDUzMDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68053040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56","html_url":"https://github.com/fedala56","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-10T02:48:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3532144838,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MzIxNDQ4Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/3532144838","actor":{"login":"fedala56","id":68053040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDUzMDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68053040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56","html_url":"https://github.com/fedala56","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-10T02:48:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/707143414","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/105#issuecomment-707143414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/105","id":707143414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzE0MzQxNA==","user":{"login":"fedala56","id":68053040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDUzMDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68053040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56","html_url":"https://github.com/fedala56","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedala56/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T14:08:32Z","updated
