I can see in your example where you contain everything in the load script itself that can able to forecast successfully without using the help from the data manager.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48248322/60715646-32762080-9f3b-11e9-8c77-de21b4be1849.png)\r\n\r\nYear([Jour Calendaire]) AS [Jour Year],\r\n\tMonthName([Jour Calendaire]) AS [Jour Month & Year],\r\n\tMonth([Jour Calendaire]) AS [Jour Month],\r\n    Dual(Month([Jour Calendaire]) & '-' & Day([Jour Calendaire]), Num(Month([Jour Calendaire]), '00') & Num(Day([Jour Calendaire]), '00')) AS [Jour Day of Month];\r\n\r\nthe above code is the other thing I changed because I don't have to use it as how you used in your example. the one you have used is given below\r\n   \r\n\tYear((Date(Date#([ACCIDENTDATE], 'DD/MM/YYYY') ,'DD/MM/YYYY'))) AS [Accident Year],\r\n\tMonthName((Date(Date#([ACCIDENTDATE], 'DD/MM/YYYY') ,'DD/MM/YYYY'))) AS [Accident Month & Year],\r\n\tMonth((Date(Date#([ACCIDENTDATE], 'DD/MM/YYYY') ,'DD/MM/YYYY'))) AS [Accident Month],\r\n\tDual(Month((Date(Date#([ACCIDENTDATE], 'DD/MM/YYYY') ,'DD/MM/YYYY'))) & '-' & Day((Date(Date#([ACCIDENTDATE], 'DD/MM/YYYY') ,'DD/MM/YYYY'))), Num(Month((Date(Date#([ACCIDENTDATE], 'DD/MM/YYYY') ,'DD/MM/YYYY'))), '00') & Num(Day((Date(Date#([ACCIDENTDATE], 'DD/MM/YYYY') ,'DD/MM/YYYY'))), '00')) AS [Accident Day of Month];\r\n    \r\nyou might wonder why I am talking about this, is because I think the format of the date might have affected the table to make such blank spaces. I also tried the same way as you to contain everything in the data load script without using the data manager load but it wasn't warded off the blank space. \r\n

@lalprasanth, using the Data Manager shouldn't be a problem as long as it is at the beginning of all your other sections built in the Data Load Editor. I have done this in the Prophet sample app as well.\r\n\r\nThe NULL values in your table indicate some association is not working as you expect in your data model, or Forecast dates have not been generated correctly. You can try commenting out parts of the `Forecast Calendar` section and see where the result is not as expected.\r\n\r\nThe end result should be that each value of `Jour Calendaire` should be linked to the same value in  `FORECAST_DATE` as well as all the historical and future dates. If you build the table below in the sample app you'll see that a single value in `Accident Date` is linked to **all** values of `FORECAST_DATE`. We can use set analysis on `FORECAST_DATE_TYPE` to identify historical or future dates, and `FORECAST_LINK_TYPE` to get dates with actual data.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298843/61013888-04279380-a3c8-11e9-98a8-7bee6852af08.png)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298843/61013898-130e4600-a3c8-11e9-8273-68baad5b928f.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/510284294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2474301648,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ3NDMwMTY0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2474301648","actor":{"login":"lalprasanth","id":48248322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjQ4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48248322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth","html_url":"https://github.com/lalprasanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-11T00:57:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2474301649,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NzQzMDE2NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2474301649","actor":{"login":"lalprasanth","id":48248322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjQ4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48248322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth","html_url":"https://github.com/lalprasanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-11T00:57:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2549274464,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU0OTI3NDQ2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2549274464","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event"
