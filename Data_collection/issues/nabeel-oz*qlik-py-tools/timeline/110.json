This can happen accidentally if you click on the green tick mark to confirm a selection. This is the current behavior in Qlik Sense and so I've placed buttons in the app that can be used to enable or disable the call to Python.\r\n\r\nThe 'LS failed' message is just a normal log output from Prophet. I couldn't suppress the log, but it can be safely ignored.
