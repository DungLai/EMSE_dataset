this doesn't look like a synchronisation issue.\r\n\r\nIn the case with zero future periods it just means that the function did not receive any future periods from Qlik and so will not generate a

Marco,\r\n\r\nHaving other charts and expressions on the sheet does not interfere with the SSE calls other than giving the Qlik engine more work to do.\r\n\r\nYou can test this by using the `Parallel SSE Calls` sheet in the app attached below. This sheet makes 7 unique calls to the Prophet function in PyTools. It also has 5 standard expressions in the charts. I have tested this app without issue, even with multiple users generating unique calls using different values for the trend fitting slider. \r\n\r\n[Sample_App_Forecasting_Simple (issue #88).zip](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/files/4120375/Sample_App_Forecasting_Simple.issue.88.zip)\r\n\r\nI still think the clue you need is in my previous response. You should visualize the dimension and measure you are using as input to Prophet in a table and check for issues, for e.g. missing future periods, which may only occur when certain selections are
