I'm not sure if you'll need the related fix [10295](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10295/files) as well.\r\n\r\nThen you can run the rest of the script from `Qlik-Py-Init.bat`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/531439147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/531461833","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/47#issuecomment-531461833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/47","id":531461833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTQ2MTgzMw==","user":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-14T08:33:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-14T08:33:46Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Another option may be to just try the powershell script instead of the batch file, i.e. use `Qlik-Py-Init.ps1`.
