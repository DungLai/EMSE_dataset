This fits well with data science/ ML use cases, complex calculations and custom algorithms. Internally, Qlik is using a SSE for the GeoAnalytics connector implementation for Qlik Cloud Services.\r\n\r\nA chat bot on the other hand, requires a way to call Qlik Sense or QlikView APIs, make use of NLP libraries and provide a chat UI for the user. I don't see how SSEs fit well with those capabilities. The [Qlik Insight Bot](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/insight-bot/Content/QlikInsightBot/Home.htm) is currently implemented in .NET and uses various Qlik Sense APIs to provide its capabilities.\r\n\r\nAlso, what you're describing is available out of the box in Qlik Sense through the Insight Advisor. So a modernization of the BI platform with Qlik Sense may be a worth considering rather than trying to build such 3rd generation BI capabilities in QlikView.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/600918145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3143592523,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE0MzU5MjUyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/3143592523","actor":{"login":"sbeesm","id":27358509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm","html_url":"https://github.com/sbeesm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-19T00:08:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3143592525,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNDM1OTI1MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/3143592525","actor":{"login":"sbeesm","id":27358509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm","html_url":"https://github.com/sbeesm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-19T00:08:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/601324819","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/96#issuecomment-601324819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/96","id":601324819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTMyNDgxOQ==","user":{"login":"sbeesm","id":27358509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm","html_url":"https://github.com/sbeesm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T17:50:38Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T17:50:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Actually
