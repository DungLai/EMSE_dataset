Qlik is aborting the previous call, but does not make a new call automatically. Can you re-raise this issue on the SSE repository on Qlik-OSS: https://github.com/qlik-oss/server-side-extension/issues\r\n\r\nOne workaround for a better user experience is to use a button control that activates or disables the visualisations/ measures using the SSE. The user can then make multiple selections before triggering the SSE call. I've done this in the sample forecasting app.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/518431768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2534987667,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUzNDk4NzY2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2534987667","actor":{"login":"SyedAlamdar","id":34166232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTY2MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34166232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar","html_url":"https://github.com/SyedAlamdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-05T22:57:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2534987668,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MzQ5ODc2Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2534987668","actor":{"login":"SyedAlamdar","id":34166232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTY2MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34166232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar","html_url":"https://github.com/SyedAlamdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-05T22:57:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/518696528","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/40#issuecomment-518696528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/40","id":518696528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODY5NjUyOA==","user":{"login":"SyedAlamdar","id":34166232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTY2MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34166232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar","html_url":"https://github.com/SyedAlamdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-06T14:34:25Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T14:34:25Z","a
