@nabeel-oz, \r\nThank you for your reply. We succeed to install Qlik-Py-Tools with miniconda on our own Azure virtual machine (tested on Windows Server 2016 and 2019. However it did not worked on the virtual machine of our customer. The difference is that this virtual machine is hosted by a Hyper-V cluster instead of Azure.
