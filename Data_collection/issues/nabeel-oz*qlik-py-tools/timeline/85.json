With QSE you'll find the data in the 'attached files' of these apps. \r\n\r\nHowever, some of the capabilities in this SSE are only used through chart expressions and for such sample apps I haven't included the data as I don't expect these to require a reload. \r\n\r\nThe clustering app which I think you're trying to reload seems to be an exception. I'll look into it, but here are the two files you mentioned for now.\r\n\r\n[ASGS Structures.zip](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/files/4028267/ASGS.Structures.zip)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNabeel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/571366119/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/910096852","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/85#issuecomment-910096852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/85","id":910096852,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3Lg7c42PvnU","user":{"login":"suprememingjie","id":83269673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Njcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83269673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie","html_url":"https://github.com/suprememingjie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T09:16:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T03:42:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Nabeel, @nabeel-oz \r\n\r\nThanks for these two .qvd files for us. I really appritiate that. \r\n\r\nI reload some of your app for trying to learn them well, as I think the SSE is cool enabling qlik more powerful. \r\n\r\nIn Sample_App_Prophet.qvf, LGAs section, you gave us the way to download those data by some token. That's awsome, but I use the Qlik Sense desktop which is not able to connet the internet. I try to copy the url to download the data, but I failed.\r\n\r\nProblem 1: In Sample_App_Prophet.qvf,  New Nodes List section, you loaded a LoadedAccidentsList.qvd. I couldn't find it. Are you able to give us advice for how we get them or share it to us ?\r\n\r\nProblem 2: In Sample_App_Correlations.qvf I can't find table [VIF ERP] in LGA Statistical Profiles 2015.xlsx file, so it couldn't work. I download the data from the link you shared. Could you give kind advice about how we can get the table [VIF ERP]. (Sample App - Correlations.qvf )\r\n\r\nProblem 3: I reloaded the Sample App scikit-learn - Train & Test.qvf in Machine Learning part, everthing seems goes well, but in Qlik data load editor, when I try to sync scripted data for these tables, qlik doesn't sync the data to those tables. Is that ok or somewhere I might done wrong?\r\n\r\nProblem 4: In Sample-App-Prophet-Multivariate.qvf, 80% code work well, only from Forcast Calandar table in the Forcast Calandar section, it gives erro:\r\n                                                      Error in expression:\r\n                                                      ')' expected.\r\nI cheched very carefully. It seems no problem with the \" ')' expected\". Also, in Sample_App_Prophet.qvf, it has almost same Forcast Calandar section which can work well. Is that a bug or something I need to revise.\r\n\r\nProblem 5: In  the TEMP_TRAIN_TEST table from Sample App scikit-learn - K-fold CV + Grid Search.qvf, the PerformanceRating filed isn't in the HR-Employee-Attrition.xlsx. What is that?\r\n\r\nCould you help me with these problems? I know there are many questions, so I hope get your help when you are free.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply \r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\nOli","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/910096852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"suprememingjie","id":83269673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Njcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83269673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie","html_url":"https://github.com/suprememingjie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suprememingjie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5251119495,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB3Lg7c4giWhnzwAAAAE4_bmH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/5251119495","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-03T03:42:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5251119497,"node_id":"SE_lADOB3Lg7c4giWhnzwAAAAE4_bmJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/5251119497","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-03T03:42:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
