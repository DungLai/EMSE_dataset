This indicates that the problem lies with your expression or data model. If you're following the forecast calendar script from this project's documentation you need a bit of set analysis for both the actual and the prediction expressions.\r\n\r\nNote the set analysis used in the expressions in the sample app:\r\n`Count({$<FORECAST_LINK_TYPE = {'Actual'}>} Distinct ACCIDENT_NO)`\r\n\r\nYou could have a simpler data model where this set analysis is not required. I've set up the model in this way so that the actual dates and forecast dates are two different fields, allowing two different set of selections. This lets us run the forecast on a subset of the actual time series e.g. from 2017-2018, yet still visualize the forecast across a longer period e.g. 2016-2019.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/413068088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1789160916,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc4OTE2MDkxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/1789160916","actor":{"login":"kolbrant","id":42373470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzczNDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42373470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant","html_url":"https://github.com/kolbrant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-15T01:38:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1789160917,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3ODkxNjA5MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/1789160917","actor":{"login":"kolbrant","id":42373470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzczNDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42373470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant","html_url":"https://github.com/kolbrant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-15T01:38:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1789224559,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxNzg5MjI0NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/1789224559","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-15T02:52:20Z","assignee":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.c

Just fill them with blank or null values as shown for 2017/18 and 2018/19 in the example below, and the forecasting algorithm will understand that it needs to add in predictions for those years. The forecast calendar script, the resulting set analysis for measures, and the IF condition in the dimension won't be required with this simple approach.\r\n\r\n![sample data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298843/44263314-c5de2e80-a261-11e8-8385-2420f449b3a2.png)\r\n\r\nI'll update the documentation so it's clear that the forecasting calendar, variables, etc. are optional and only required for a deeper user experience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/413836220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1794454872,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxNzk0NDU0ODcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/1794454872","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-17T11:24:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/413837997","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/4#issuecomment-413837997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/4","id":413837997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzgzNzk5Nw==","user":{"login":"kolbrant","id":42373470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzczNDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42373470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant","html_url":"https://github.com/kolbrant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolbrant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T11:33:43Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T11:33:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The expression for the Actual and Forecast are as follows - \r\nActual: `Sum([Invånare])`\r\nForecast: `PyTools.Prophet(if(FORECAST_YEAR <= AddYears(Max(Total [År]), $(vForecastPeriods)), FORECAST_YEAR),\r\nCount({$<FORECAST_LINK_TYPE = {'Actual'}>} Sum([Invånare])),\r\n'freq=MS, return=yhat')`\r\n\r\nI will try with the example that you provided and see what happens.

@narayanankm, that error seems to be with pip which is a very basic module in Python. You'll need to check that your environment is set up correctly according to the installation notes. \r\n\r\nOne possible problem is that you're running the 32 bit installation of Python. On a modern system you really should be using the 64 bit version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/488548572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2313501178,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxMzUwMTE3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2313501178","actor":{"login":"narayanankm","id":47073455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDczNDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47073455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm","html_url":"https://github.com/narayanankm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-02T04:17:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2313501180,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTM1MDExODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2313501180","actor":{"login":"narayanankm","id":47073455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDczNDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47073455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm","html_url":"https://github.com/narayanankm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narayanankm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-02T04:17:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
