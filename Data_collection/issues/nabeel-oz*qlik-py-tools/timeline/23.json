think you may have misunderstood the capabilities of this Server Side Extension (SSE). It provides functions built in Python which provide a specific capability to be used in Qlik. For e.g the Prophet function can produce a forecast. There is Python code behind the function that uses several libraries like fbprophet, pandas and numpy, but in Qlik you simply call the function in the expression editor or load script to produce a forecast without having to use any Python code.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to write Python script in Qlik and have it evaluated in the SSE, but this type of usage is not available with PyTools as mentioned in the [notes on the approach](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools#note-on-the-approach). \r\n\r\nIf you want to build your own SSE the best place to start is here:
