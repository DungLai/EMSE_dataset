The apriori algorithm used for association rules mining is quite processing intensive. The key parameter you can adjust is the `min_support` which sets the minimum frequency at which the antecedent and consequent items must appear together in the dataset to be considered for an association rule. You can try setting this above the default value of `0.5` to avoid calculations for items that appear together infrequently in the dataset. \r\n\r\nThe syntax to define additional parameters is described here: https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/Association-Rules.md#association-rules-analysis-with-efficient-apriori","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/776388049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4312451658,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDMxMjQ1MTY1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/4312451658","actor":{"login":"pajo79","id":77012970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDEyOTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77012970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79","html_url":"https://github.com/pajo79","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-10T02:17:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4312451662,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzMTI0NTE2NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/4312451662","actor":{"login":"pajo79","id":77012970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDEyOTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77012970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79","html_url":"https://github.com/pajo79","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pajo79/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-10T02:17:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
