This extension is tested with vanilla Python 3.6 and does not support Anaconda. The initialization script sets up a Python virtual environment that is known to work with this Server Side Extension.\r\n\r\nI don't have any reference to the `nonzero` attribute in the code, so I can't give any explanation to the error you're getting without a stack trace. The problem with the ML Predictions app just looks like the model may not exist. You will need to run the K-fold Cross Validation app to train the model. Take a look at the app dependencies under the [Usage](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools#usage) section.\r\n\r\nI do strongly recommend using the `Qlik-Py-Init` script or the Docker container to setup the SSE.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/600349286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3139417691,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEzOTQxNzY5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/3139417691","actor":{"login":"tauceef","id":62294978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjk0OTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62294978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef","html_url":"https://github.com/tauceef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-17T23:30:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3139417692,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMzk0MTc2OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/3139417692","actor":{"login":"tauceef","id":62294978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjk0OTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62294978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef","html_url":"https://github.com/tauceef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-17T23:30:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/600998872","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/95#issuecomment-600998872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/95","id":600998872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDk5ODg3Mg==","user":{"login":"tauceef","id":62294978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjk0OTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62294978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef","html_url":"https://github.com/tauceef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tauceef/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T05:41:47Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T05:41:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
