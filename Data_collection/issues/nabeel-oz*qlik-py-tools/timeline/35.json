For example, it will transform the descriptions `AGGRAVATED: HANDGUN` and `AGGRAVATED: OTHER` to `AGGRAVATED:` and you'll end up with two rows for this `SubGroup` for each `CA`. The final input to the clustering algorithm should have one unique row for each item that you are trying to cluster; `CA` in this case.\r\n\r\nI think using the `description` or `iucr` field for the sub-grouping would make more sense. The other option is to use a `Group By` clause so that rates are aggregated by your key dimension and subgroup.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/514007873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2501478594,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUwMTQ3ODU5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2501478594","actor":{"login":"LiteralToddChavez","id":53191385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTkxMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53191385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez","html_url":"https://github.com/LiteralToddChavez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-23T00:40:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2501478595,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MDE0Nzg1OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2501478595","actor":{"login":"LiteralToddChavez","id":53191385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTkxMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53191385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez","html_url":"https://github.com/LiteralToddChavez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-23T00:40:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/514928962","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/35#issuecomment-514928962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/35","id":514928962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDkyODk2Mg==","user":{"login":"LiteralToddChavez","id":53191385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTkxMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53191385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez","html_url":"https://github.com/LiteralToddChavez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralToddChavez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiteralTod
