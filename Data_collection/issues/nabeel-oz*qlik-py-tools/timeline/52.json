This is commonly used in building the 'Master Calendar' in a Qlik app. \r\n\r\nFor the sample app the following code can be used to generate future months. By looping over the Hospital field, we get the correct granularity for this particular data model.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Get the last month for which we have actual data\r\nTempMax:\r\nLOAD\r\n

Dear @nabeel-oz , I do not know how @Franky1010 managed to write his LOAD script to allow the attendance's field for the Fieldvalue _A S EIVISSA Y FORMENTERA (HOSPITAL CAN MISSES)_ to have three non-null values for the Prophet library to generate the required forecast values\r\n\r\nAs shown in the Print Screen above, it seems that this Fieldvalue _A S EIVISSA Y FORMENTERA (HOSPITAL CAN MISSES)_  has only two values for its Attendances. Sorry @Franky1010 , I assume you did it in your LOAD script, so please correct me if I am wrong. That is why I am asking for advice here because @Franky1010 got his script working. Can anyone share some information? \r\n\r\n@nabeel-oz , as for your comment above, I understand the scripting of the additional future periods. Thank you again for pointing out.
