You can pass the `debug=true` argument in your `vExecutionArgs` variable to find out where this error occurs. I see this error is for the VotingClassifier estimator, which is an ensemble algorithm and requires a list of estimators that it will use for voting. \r\n\r\nCurrently it's not possible to pass a list of tuples in the hyperparameters as is required for this classifier, so you should just take it out from your list of estimators. Just looking at the number of estimators you are using, I'd suggest to pick a few from the different methods and try them out first. \r\n\r\nSince this is a public dataset, you can search for techniques used to get the best results. In most problems you need to derive new features from the base data to get better predictions. The input features will often have a much bigger impact on your model's accuracy than the type of estimator used.
