The function definition that will be visible in Qlik needs to be added under the `functions.json` file. The mapping to tie these bits together is defined in the `functions` property of the `ExtensionService` class.\r\n\r\nIf you're extending this SSE you can modify the files under the `qlik-py-tools/qlik-py-env/core` folder. If you want to build your own SSE, the examples at [qlik-oss](https://github.com/qlik-oss/server-side-extension) may be a good start.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/515979347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2516391294,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxNjM5MTI5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2516391294","actor":{"login":"Faustiine","id":39300080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzAwMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39300080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine","html_url":"https://github.com/Faustiine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T12:54:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2516391296,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTYzOTEyOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/events/2516391296","actor":{"login":"Faustiine","id":39300080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzAwMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39300080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine","html_url":"https://github.com/Faustiine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T12:54:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/516300614","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/36#issuecomment-516300614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/36","id":516300614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjMwMDYxNA==","user":{"login":"Faustiine","id":39300080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzAwMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39300080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine","html_url":"https://github.com/Faustiine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Faustiine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T07:30:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T08:16:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
