From the request data frame in the SSE logs I can see that you have actual values until Dec 2018. \r\n\r\nI suppose you have reloaded the app from a source file with additional data, but did not extend the future periods. You can either add the future periods in the source file or use the load script snippet in issue #52. You may also want to update the Actual measure as it was fixed to only show values before July 2018. \r\n\r\nAlso, you can just use [Sample_App_Forecasting_Simple.qvf](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/Sample_App_Forecasting_Simple.qvf) which comes with the latest data and future periods.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/537759516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/537807943","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/54#issuecomment-537807943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/54","id":537807943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzgwNzk0Mw==","user":{"login":"Kev-kutkin","id":25189239,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTg5MjM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25189239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin","html_url":"https://github.com/Kev-kutkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev-kutkin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-03T06:33:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-03T06:58:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Nabeel, actually if you do not mind, could you kindly provide us the raw excel and csv files that are required to specifically used in the LOAD script?

I mean some of the filename mentioned in the LOAD script cannot be found in the two links provided by you at all. For example, I cannot find the source file for PERSON.csv or VEHICLE.csv in the two links provided. I really hope you understand because I find it quite hard to learn to reproduce the forecasting chart because I could not reload the data models, add new future values, and then use new data source that is suitable for your script to read it.
