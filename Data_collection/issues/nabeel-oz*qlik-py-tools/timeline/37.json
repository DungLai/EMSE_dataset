For e.g. store the list of selections in a Qlik variable and use that as one of the parameters for your SSE function calls.\r\n\r\nHowever, what you have asked should be doable:\r\n\r\nOn the Qlik side you could have a variable that has a SSE function as the expression. This function should take in the list of selections as an argument. \r\n\r\nOn the Python side you then need an object that retains it's state during multiple SSE calls. One option is to extend the `ExtensionService` class in `__main__.py` with a variable to store your list.\r\n\r\nIf you are building a new class and define your SSE function as a `@staticmethod`, you will need to store your list in a class variable as any instance of the class will only exist during a single call. \r\n\r\nAnd if you want the list to survive a restart of the SSE you'll need to save it to disk with something like joblib or pickle.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.

Nabeel,\r\nIndeed they are not. Each call is with the same set of parameters. But still it takes very long for the charts to finish rendering. Any idea why this might be?

The intention here is for Qlik to plot a scatter plot using the two columns. \r\n\r\nBut apparently we cannot return a table to Qlik. So I converted that table into a json string and passed it to Qlik. I then use the Subfield and TextBetween functions to parse the json string and get back the float values. \r\n\r\nIs there a better way to do this?\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/517756384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sagarkolte","id":53483011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDgzMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53483011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte","html_url":"https://github.com/sagarkolte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkolte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/518437049","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/37#issuecomment-518437049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/37","id":518437049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODQzNzA0OQ==","user":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-05T23:23:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T23:24:40Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"On your first question of the charts would just be waiting for the SSE response so performance improvements can only be made on the Python side. \r\n\r\nYou can experiment with a single call and check that it is getting cached in Qlik.

Usually this should not be a problem in the frontend as each SSE call is made through a measure or dimension which is a single column rather than a table.
