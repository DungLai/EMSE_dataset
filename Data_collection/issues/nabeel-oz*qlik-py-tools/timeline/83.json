Nabeel-Oz/Qlik-Py-Tools,\n\nHappy New Year to you by the way.\n\nYes, I did read the usage.doc.  I guess I struggle (newbie to ML) with some\nof the parameter decisions in the load scrip. Specifically in the ML Config\nsection, I get the \"variable type\" (Feature vs Target), but I'\nm unsure about the data type for example. My data is all numbers so I know\nit;'s not \"str\" but unclear about the difference between \"float\" and \"Int\"\nor even what \"bool\" might be used for.\n\nAlso in that section, the \"Feature Strategy\" which I am labeling as\n\"scaling\" bu my 'features' are actually already standardized and\npercentile-rank scores so they should not need scaling ?\n\nI also have one target (\"R1000\") but ten features (column D-M in the\nattached).  Basically these are ten metrics we use to predict the direction\nof markets, in this case the Russell 1000 index.  So I'm trying to use your\ntemplate in an app to see if Keras comes up with a similar forecast for the\nnext few days as we do.\n\nWhat could be helpful is if you point me to the right places in your load\nscript where I should make modifications.  I've tried to identify those on\nmy own but this has led to this data load error (i.e. I can't even get my\ndata into your app).  Understand that you are busy, this is not urgent.  If\nyou send me a few hints I'll keep trying, but two weeks is fine for you to\ntry and fix the app itself.  I'm attaching the latest iteration and the\ndata file I'm using.\n\nThank you so much,\n\nOlivier\nPS: the next app of your I want to try is the Basket app.  Since we have\nthe factor returns for our models, they can act as a sort of grocery\nitemized bills, and I would like to use the app to determine which factors\ninvestors buy and sell together as a way to challenge our covariance matrix.\n\nOn Tue, Jan 7, 2020 at 8:03 AM Nabeel <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi @Odassier <https://github.com/Odassier> , can you please post the full\n> error log from the SSE terminal?

right changes in the load script and the first few sheets work fine, I'm getting good results.  But the final two sheet show an Error. I'm not sure what to change in the load scipt for those two to work.  It should use 2018 and 2019 data (and like in your example I'm ok reusing the 2019 values for the two selected regressors as 2020 forecasts) and show me a 2020 forecast but it does not. \r\nI'm attaching the app here and hope you know a quick fix. \r\nThank you for your help with this. \r\nOlivier\r\n[Axioma-ROOF-Prophet-Multivariate - Copy.zip](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/files/4052816/Axioma-ROOF-Prophet-Multivariate.-.Copy.zip)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/573576654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Odassier","id":58876935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODc2OTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58876935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier","html_url":"https://github.com/Odassier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Odassier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/573927786","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/83#issuecomment-573927786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/83","id":573927786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzkyNzc4Ng==","user":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T23:43:35Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T23:43:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I ran your Keras app and it generates this error where the first line explains the problem.
