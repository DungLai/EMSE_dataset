It is only (in additive model). Data minus season minus holiday minus trend. But I cannot do that directly in Qlik.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like you want to calculate the 'residuals' between the predictable components and the actual values, which as mentioned by Prophet's author [here](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/issues/309) can be calculated as `y - yhat`. \r\n\r\nI included a quick change in release 6.4 published today which returns this result for the historical periods. Simply pass `return=residual` in the additional arguments to the `PyTools.Prophet` function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPyTools.Prophet([Month Start], Sum(Attendances), 'freq=MS, return=residual')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe calculation could also be done in Qlik using the [Column](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/June2019/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/ChartFunctions/InterRecordFunctions/column.htm) function. You would need to have Actual and Forecast as measures in the chart, and then use `Column(1) - Column(2)` to get the residuals.\r\n\r\n> - I made a forecast month by month of turnover of a market, and I want to calculate turnover of the next year but I cannot add the future 12 month directly in Qlik.\r\n\r\nI don't understand this case. Can't you just add future months to the data model using the forecast calendar approach explained in the usage documentation?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNabeel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/575449203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/580248241","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/87#issuecomment-580248241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/87","id":580248241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDI0ODI0MQ==","user":{"login":"acabos91","id":40993382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTkzMzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40993382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91","html_url":"https://github.com/acabos91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acabos91/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-30T13:18:24Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T13:18:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Nabeel,\r\n\r\nSorry about the delay.\r\nAnd thank you for your precise answer. \r\nThis change on the return is perfect, this is exactly what I want.\r\nFor the other, I was not able to made operation of results coming from Pytools.\r\nBut now I can made operation thanks to Aggr.
