The [PersistentModel](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/core/_machine_learning.py) class defines methods to save and load a model from disk. \r\n\r\nAs you can see this is a simple class. The communication with Qlik is abstracted away by other modules. I've used `joblib` in this case as the persistent model contains the trained sklearn estimator and related objects. If you were saving a pandas dataframe you could just save to csv.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/524676558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/comments/548996873","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/44#issuecomment-548996873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/44","id":548996873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODk5Njg3Mw==","user":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-02T01:21:40Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T01:21:40Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing
