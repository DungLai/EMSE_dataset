YAML file with a configured DNS ? Have you already run the extension in kibernetes ? Does the service support  type: NodePort in the service YAML file ?\r\n\r\nWhat is the protocol used in the communication between the extension and Qlik ?\r\nIs there a simple way to check if the extension is working from commande line? for example from the kibernetes linux client machine.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\nSidi\r\n\r\n\r\n[yaml.zip](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/files/4844758/yaml.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
