I need to use the forecast in script like example app Sample_App_Forecasting_Simple. My question is if it's possible to create date to forecast in this example, because in the excel that app reads it has the dates to predict already created. So what can I do if I want to crate dates to predict for each hospital and I don't have them created in Excel?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Franky1010","id":55097940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDk3OTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55097940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010","html_url":"https://github.com/Franky1010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Franky1010/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/52/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/52/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
