So the communication between the SSE and QS is not confirmed. Also to check connection, used QS and typed \"Pytools.\" in the expression editor and no function details came up..\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots from `Qlik-Py-Init` to show the full error message.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - OS Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard and Windows 10 Enterprise\r\n - Qlik Sense Enterprise and Desktop June 2020 IR\r\n - SSE Version: 8.0 I also tried 8.1 and no luck\r\n- Python version: 3.6.7\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nChecked the firewall for the Qlik Pytools rule, it was created for port 50055; I also manually deleted and added the rule and tried to run Qlik-Py-Start... no luck. I also restarted the engine service, no luck.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
