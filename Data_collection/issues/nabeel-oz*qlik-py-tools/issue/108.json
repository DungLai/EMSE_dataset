Please describe.**\r\nYour instruction for the app \"Sample_App_Forecasting_Simple\" is very clear. The installation and the trial of the app immediately worked. Great! \r\nHowever I do not know what to do when I have for the y axis an aggreation function where the Month_Date is not included: for example: \" (sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung)+sum({$<FSA = {EA10}>}Saldo_Buchung))/sum({$<FSA = {EE10}>}Saldo_Buchung)\". Here the percentual gross margin is calculated. The x axis is Month(Booking date).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMore examples. I think the PyTools.Prophet formula is not well explained. What do the parameters mean exactly? Easy examples would help a lot. \r\n\r\nHow to do a forecast for Month ()-functions....
