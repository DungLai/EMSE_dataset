I would like to know is there a way to make the forecast reflect according to any dimension selection that I made?\r\n\r\nSo far I've tried with hardcoded dimension value in set analysis work. \r\nFor eg. Pytools.Prophet(DATE,If($(vVisible) = 1,sum({<State={'ABC'}>}SALES_AMT)),'freq=D,return=y_then_yhat')\r\n\r\nBut I would like to know would it be possible the forecast function work without doing the hardcoded set analysis value in measurement?\r\n\r\nExpected Result: Forecast work when user made any dimension filtration. Eg. selection made on any dimension value of state then the forecast will display according to the selection made.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any advice/feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n**Full error message from Python**\r\nProvide full stack trace for the error.\r\nIf using `Qlik-Py-Start` you can provide screenshots from the terminal.
