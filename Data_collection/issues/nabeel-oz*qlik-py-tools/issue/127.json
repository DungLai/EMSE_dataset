However, when I attempt to train and test the model I get an error message that states \"Target is multiclass but average='binary'. Please choose another average setting, one of [None, 'micro', 'macro', 'weighted'].'\" After doing some research, I think I found that this error message is related to the sklearn score function, but I am not sure how to pass in the average parameter in Qlik. Should I be using Setup_Adv instead of Setup. If so, which argument would I pass it in with? If anyone has any ideas please let me know!
