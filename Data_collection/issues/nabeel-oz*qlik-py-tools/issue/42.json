Funny thing is that that are moments when I don't get this error and it goes thought to a successful load.  I first thought that this could be due to my data but I tried fixing this in the load script (you will see one you load the file).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34166232/62839755-dc844f00-bc43-11e9-8b96-5571d97d4836.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34166232/62839764-02115880-bc44-11e9-8169-ca42d2f00d58.png)\r\n\r\nMy data and the structured data with the Qlik App is part of the ticket. I am using publically available data so anyone who is doing this is most welcome to dive in. \r\n\r\n My Files:\r\n[winequality-white-setup.xlsx](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/files/3490459/winequality-white-setup.xlsx)\r\n[ML Training.zip](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/files/3490461/ML.Training.zip)\r\n\r\nAnother fun fact, when this runs, the best results I get are in lower 50%s. Any tips to improve those will also help.
