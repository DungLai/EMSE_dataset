Basically, I have a measure to be calculated using the following expression\r\n\r\n(1-(sum({$<Année=,Semaine=,Jour=,LieA={'Cause Fournisseur'}>}$(vValManq))/(sum({$<Année=,LieA={'Cause Fournisseur'},Semaine=,Jour=>}$(vValManq)) + Sum({$<Année=,Semaine=,Jour=>}$(vValSortie)))))*100\r\n\r\nbut I am just wondering how can it be manipulated to the following expression as you have used in your measure to forecast the values or is it something to be replaced with my measure. \r\n\r\nCount({$<FORECAST_LINK_TYPE = {'Actual'}>} Distinct ACCIDENT_NO)\r\n\r\n Whatever that has been written in the measure has to be added to the pytools.prophet function as well when we forecast the values. I hope you clarify my doubts.","closed_by":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
