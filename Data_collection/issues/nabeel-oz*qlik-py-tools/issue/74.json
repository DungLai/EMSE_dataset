Would you be able to recommend a gpu instance with deep learning libraries pre-installed, so that we could bring down the time to reload the Keras app to less than 5 minutes? \r\n\r\nSo far, we've tried EC2 and paperspace and faced challenges setting up PyTools on Linux - is there a linux script available to initialize and run, instead of docker?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while choosing Windows, the apps only use cpu. Is there way to ensure that GPU is enabled on windows, for the apps to utilize it? \r\n\r\nThank you very much.","closed_by":{"login":"zerubroberts","id":3461046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjEwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3461046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/zerubroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerubroberts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
