However, for this precalculated method, I do not know which part of your scripting controls the forecast period required, for example 6 months or 12 months, or 24 months, as compared to your another calendar method. For this precalculated method,  I have three questions. \r\n(1) In the LOAD script, is the field PERIOD or the [MONTH START] responsible for the last month to be forecasted? \r\n(2) Are we using the chart expression to indicate the starting month to be forecasted instead of the LOAD script? \r\n(3) Can we forecast Attendance values for months in year 2020? If so, how can we do that in the scripting? \r\nPart one:\r\nBesides these two questions, I have also encountered several problems that I am so eager to share with you and other users. Please advise me to solve it. \r\nWhat I have done so far: I have prepared my LOAD script and obtained the data model as shown below. It is not as what we expect actually. There is no link key available. \r\n![data_model_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25189239/66552820-e10f9b80-eafe-11e9-902a-8362ed4b5a3f.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\nPart two:\r\nPart two is based on my own data and not the hospital attendance dataset. What happened is that I have encountered error as shown below. \r\n![field_error_qs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25189239/66552214-c5f05c00-eafd-11e9-8fa0-216e37b3211f.JPG)\r\n\r\nThe qlik sense cannot proceed with the error above and the Command-line also generated the same error as shown below. \r\n![forecast_error_output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25189239/66552334-0223bc80-eafe-11e9-8dd1-78b64f42cd98.JPG)\r\n\r\n@nabeel-oz , do we need to change the code block for the Prophet to bypass this error or can we reply on the scripting in Qlik Sense to solve this infinity error? I have no experience in dealing with infinity issue on the response variable. \r\n\r\nPlease advise me for these questions in the two parts above.\r\nThank you for your time. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
