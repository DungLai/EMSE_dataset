It is very useful.\r\nMy issue is that I cannot made operation on objects calculated with Python.\r\nI have some simple cases to explain :\r\n- I can calculate season, holiday and trend composant thanks to Pytools, I want to calculate noise. It is only (in additive model). Data minus season minus holiday minus trend. But I cannot do that directly in Qlik.\r\n- I made a forecast month by month of turnover of a market, and I want to calculate turnover of the next year but I cannot add the future 12 month directly in Qlik.\r\n\r\nI don't want to do that into the script because main goal of this sheet (for our business) is that the client choose his parameter and see its forecast / decomposition. So pre-calculate induce a very heavy application (without this our apps are an average weight of 1 GB).\r\n\r\nSo it is possible to do operation such as Pytools.prophet(...) + Pytools.prophet or - Sum() etc ...\r\nAnd also handle data, aggregate data from month (calculate result year, evolution, standard deviation ...)\r\nMaybe it is already possible with some tips, but I cannot find it, I try to use Aggr for example but it is not working.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help\r\nBest regards,\r\nAnthony Cabos","closed_by":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/87/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
