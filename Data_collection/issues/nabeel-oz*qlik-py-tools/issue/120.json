The combination Qlik & Phyton really is powerful.\r\n\r\nI'm specifically using the PyTools.Association_Rules. I experience very poor performance though on the Phyton Side.  I'm on MS Windows 2019 Server 2,3 Ghz (8 Core Xeon), 56 GB RAM.\r\n\r\nEven when using a data-set of < 1 000 000 transactions, computation takes >4 hours. Is there any tips on how to increase performance?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nbr\r\nPaul \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
