I'd succefully run Qlik-Py-Init.bat (version 6.0) and everything went smoothly. But I still have no connection between Python and Qlik Sense Desktop (Windows10).\r\n\r\nP.S. I've already successfully established the connection, but my Qlik did not have the Dashboard extension Bundle installed and I had to reinstall Qlik and did the whole procedure to install SSE again and now I can't establish the connection in any way.   \r\n\r\n### \r\n![file1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57267841/68047447-79103780-fcef-11e9-8f97-9a030dec770d.png)\r\n![file2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57267841/68047449-79103780-fcef-11e9-98f0-9e384a902e83.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tatiana-W2019","id":57267841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjY3ODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57267841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019","html_url":"https://github.com/Tatiana-W2019","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tatiana-W2019/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
