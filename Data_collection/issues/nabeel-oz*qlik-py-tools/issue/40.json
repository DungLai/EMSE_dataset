The visualization with python gives an error when we select a dimension while python is calculating in the background. \"Error: Unknown Error\". \r\n\r\nSteps to recreate:\r\n1. Select a value from a filter that impacts and triggers the visualization to recompute. \r\n2. Before the computation is complete, select the green checkbox to confirm the dimension selection. \r\n\r\nThat's it. \r\n\r\nRegards","closed_by":{"login":"SyedAlamdar","id":34166232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTY2MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34166232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar","html_url":"https://github.com/SyedAlamdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SyedAlamdar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/40/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
