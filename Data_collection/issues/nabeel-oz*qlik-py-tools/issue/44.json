Let's say to_csv using panda. Can you please provide an example of where using panda we can export the data out and stage it in a particular folder. A good use case will be to triage events that are predicted. For a close loop to exist we can have other users evaluate the results and highlight false positives that will then again become part of the training model. \r\n\r\nIn short, can we use python to extract the data out on to access to a destination of our choice? (and I am not talking about right-clicking and exporting the data). If you do intend to build a sample, would be nice to have a sample of how a variable value can be saved and if possible a table can be exported.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSyed","closed_by":{"login":"nabeel-oz","id":21298843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz","html_url":"https://github.com/nabeel-oz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabeel-oz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/44/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/44/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
