I have already managed to run successfully the [example provided](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/Sample-App-Market-Basket.qvf) using the [UCI Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx). I have also generated my own \"_Association Rules.qvd_\" file with the mentioned UCI dataset, without any issues at all (well, other than that [weird behaviour](https://github.com/tommyod/Efficient-Apriori/issues/30#issuecomment-626129085) of Efficient-Apriori algorithm, taking a considerable amount of time to process even small datsets). However and for some reason, when I try to generate the \"_Association Rules.qvd_\" with my own dataset, it triggers the following message: \"_**The following error occurred:\r\nConnector reply error: grpc::StatusCode::UNAVAILABLE: 'channel is in state TRANSIENT_FAILURE'**_\". And I keep getting that exact same message, regardeless of the dataset I am trying. I have tried to look for that error in Stack Overflow and Qlik Help, but even when I have stumbled upon some slightly related issues, there is nothing alike to this. What am I missing?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n2. Follow installation rules described [here](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools). Make sure '_Qlik-Py-Start.bat_' is running.\r\n3. Download & unzip the [following files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/113xv_3NtVt22aOM_0MMrWLQnC5IDMkfK/view?usp=sharing) to some local directory of your own. You might need to take 'MBA_ECU_QUARTER.qvf' file to the directory which keeps Qlik Apps (i.e., in my case, it was 'C:\\Users\\david\\Documents\\Qlik\\Sense\\Apps', you need to check your own connection).\r\n4. Download all the [data sources](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/tree/master/docs/LOTR) to the same directory than Step 3.\r\n5. Open Qlik Sense, you should see by now an app called 'MBA_ECU_QUARTER'. Open it, and create a data connection named 'AttachedFiles', making sure in points to the same directory than Step 3.\r\n6. Tab 'Prepare' --> 'Data load editor' --> Clik button 'Load Data'. You should see the script running.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter some time, you should see a file called  \"_Association Rules.qvd_\" in the directory mentioned on Step 3.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nI think the issue is self-explanatory. I will provide screenshots if needed, under specification.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - OS: Windows 10 Pro, Version 20H2, Compilation 19042.985, Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.2020.0\r\n - Qlik Sense Desktop Version: November 2020 Patch 8\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOther than the UCI Dataset and the [Lord of the Rings](https://github.com/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/blob/master/docs/Sample-App-Market-Basket.qvf) (with an [homonym dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mokosan/lord-of-the-rings-character-data#LordOfTheRingsBook.json)), no other dataset could generate the \"Association Rules.qvd\" files.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
