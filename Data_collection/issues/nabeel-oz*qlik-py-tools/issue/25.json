Thank you for sharing your knowledge and work with us. Coming to the point, I would like to know if this integration works with Qlikview as well?\r\nAs you know, we usually update setting.ini or analytic connection with the port number 50055 to integrate with Qlik Sense. Does this work with Qlik view as well? if I committed the same thing as I did with Qlik Sense.","closed_by":{"login":"lalprasanth","id":48248322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjQ4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48248322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth","html_url":"https://github.com/lalprasanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalprasanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
