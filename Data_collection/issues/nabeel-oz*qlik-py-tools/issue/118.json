Not sure if this a bug or a feature request or a documentation/help request. What I am trying to do is to use the parameter output_transaction_ids as described here: https://github.com/tommyod/Efficient-Apriori. It is important to have this parameter in order to be able to have a meaningful link between the association rules and the data set. The current examples of implementing the apriori do not have a proper link to the transaction as linking through the RHE and LHE parts of the rule brings you links from the left part or right part of the rule, but that is not a link from the whole rule. The effect is a very non-Qlik experience in the dashboard front end. I think having the Rule->Transaction IDs link is vital.\r\n\r\n**Full error message from Python**\r\nProvide full stack trace for the error.\r\nIf using `Qlik-Py-Start` you can provide screenshots from the terminal. Make sure to go all the way up to the start of the errors.\r\nAlternatively, you can provide the latest log files from `../qlik-py-tools/qlik-py-env/core/logs`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49514378/98650011-f9c13500-2340-11eb-802f-06cbf943698d.png)\r\n\r\n**Error message in Qlik**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49514378/98664408-00f13e80-2353-11eb-9b87-49e2bb5769de.png)\r\n\r\n**Expression or load script used in Qlik**\r\nThe Qlik script is standard - based on the demos provided with the SSE.
