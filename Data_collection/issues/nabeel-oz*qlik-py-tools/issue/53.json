In this model the data is getting forecasted for history as well as the future years, but I do not want to forecast the data for the past history data rather I wanted to forecast the data only for the future years based on parameter\r\nscenario: Years 2017,2018,2019 and actual data is available for 2017,2018,2019\r\nparameter: 2 years\r\nAfter the logic the prediction will happen for 5 years  from 2017, 2018,2019,2020,2021 but forecast should happen only for 2020 and 2021 and not for the 2017,2018 and 2019 hope my question is clear\r\nI am trying to modify the logic and implement but I feel some difficulties\r\n\r\n\r\nAny ideas to do this?\r\n\r\nThank you so much again\r\nRegards\r\nSubash \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nivi05subhash","id":55866612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODY2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55866612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash","html_url":"https://github.com/nivi05subhash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivi05subhash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
