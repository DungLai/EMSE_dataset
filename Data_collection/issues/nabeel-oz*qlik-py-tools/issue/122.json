For this we use miniconda and the setup instructions on this page.\r\nWe have a working demo environment on virtual machines (local and Azure). But after a succesfull (no error) installation on our client's server we are unable to start the service.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - OS: Windows Server 2016\r\n - Qlik Sense Enterprise 13.82 (June 2020)\r\n - SSE Version v.8.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe created a test server and used the follow (working) installation on our virtual machines:\r\n\r\n1. Install Miniconda (www.conda.io)\r\n1a. Install for all users\r\n1b. Install miniconda to the %PATH%\r\n2. Open Anaconda Prompt and execute the following commando's in here.\r\n3. Downgrade python to 3.6.8\r\nCommand: conda install python=3.6.8 \r\n4. Update conda\r\nCommand: conda update conda\r\n5. Install C++ compiler (Python: mingw-w64) as describe in the PyStan documentation\r\nCommand: conda install libpython m2w64-toolchain -c msys2\r\n6. Build the script\r\nCommand: Qlik-Py-Init.bat \r\n7. Add PyTools to the Analytic Connections in Qlik Sense\r\n8. Start the SSE Plugin\r\nCommand: Qlik-Py-Start.bat\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![errormessage1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64427440/109308045-ce0b8180-7841-11eb-9560-d4c8b7bd5925.png)\r\n\r\n![errormessage2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64427440/109308050-cf3cae80-7841-11eb-9fe0-006a05ae9e2c.png)\r\n\r\n![errorinfo1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64427440/109308049-cea41800-7841-11eb-8b92-88e79a67f6c6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
