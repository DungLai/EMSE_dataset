Query prediction/suggestion would be a plus point.\r\nFor example: Chart for sale of cars in Germany in year 2019 would populate a bar chart with 2019 car sales in Germany.\r\n\r\nI guess the query suggestion part is the most tricky one to handle. Also, I can't think of the right Qlikview sheet object to handle such functionality.\r\n\r\nAny idea how this can be done?","closed_by":{"login":"sbeesm","id":27358509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm","html_url":"https://github.com/sbeesm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbeesm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/96/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nabeel-oz/qlik-py-tools/issues/96/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
