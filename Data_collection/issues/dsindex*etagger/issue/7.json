I've found a performance issue in input.py: `dataset.batch(batch_size)`[(line 143)](https://github.com/dsindex/etagger/blob/27143071868fce80d71661ccfb6fd83be7f955f6/input.py#L143) should be called before `dataset.map(parser,num_parallel_calls=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)`[(line 141)](https://github.com/dsindex/etagger/blob/27143071868fce80d71661ccfb6fd83be7f955f6/input.py#L141), which could make your program more efficient.\r\n\r\nHere is [the tensorflow document](https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/data_performance?hl=zh_cn#vectorized_mapping) to support it.\r\n\r\nBesides, you need to check the function `parser` called in `dataset.map(parser,num_parallel_calls=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)` whether to be affected or not to make the changed code work properly. For example, if `parser` needs data with shape (x, y, z) as its input before fix, it would require data with shape (batch_size, x, y, z) after fix.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply. Btw, I am very glad to create a PR to fix it if you are too busy.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dsindex/etagger/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dsindex/etagger/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
