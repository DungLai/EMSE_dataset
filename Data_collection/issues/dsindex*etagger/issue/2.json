Awesome repository. Thank you for making it public.\r\nIn your README.md file you reported BERT is giving you around 92.44% where as in the BERT paper they said without CRF layer they even got `92.8`  and they didn't even used any encoder.. And you are also using lot of other good feature, like `POS` tags. Can you give a comment on that?\r\nAnother thing, in your code you commented out [`[SEP]` tag](https://github.com/dsindex/etagger/blob/master/input.py#L166).  Why did you do that? What I am confused if if `[PAD]` should be before or after `[SEP]` tag.","closed_by":{"login":"sbmaruf","id":32699797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjk5Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32699797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf","html_url":"https://github.com/sbmaruf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbmaruf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dsindex/etagger/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dsindex/etagger/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
