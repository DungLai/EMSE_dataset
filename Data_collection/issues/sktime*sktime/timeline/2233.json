As current metric implementation evaluates it on all given quantiles, it is most important to ensure the predict method returns the correct ones. So far I have addressed how we can tell the forecaster what predict to use (either by changing the forecaster or the evaluate method.

today's discussion, also looking at `evaluate`:\r\n\r\n* I think we settled at giving all quantile losses an optional constructor argument `alpha`, and all interval losses an optional constructor argument `coverage`\r\n* if the argument is not provided, all alpha/coverage passed (as part of the prediction) will be used to calculate the loss\r\n* if the argument is provided, only the alpha/coverage passed will be used, and an error is raised if the specified alpha are not part of the prediction\r\n* in `evaluate`, `alpha`/`coverage` can be passed via the loss, and the `evaluate` function gets the `alpha`/`coverage` from the loss and passes it to `predict_interval`/`predict_coverage`\r\n\r\nDoes this summarize it accurately?\r\n\r\nThe alternative design is indeed having `pred_args` in `evaluate`, though that may seem a bit odd to the user, since conceptually the `alpha` \"belong\" to the loss function, at least are very close to
