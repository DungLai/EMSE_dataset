This makes sense, as you cant really generate any useful information with a subseries of length 1 and its not set up the handle that. If you still want to lower the min_interval for RISE, rise_params={'min_interval':3} would be the lowest I would go (I was able to run this on IPD). \r\n\r\nWe should set a limit on this and make it clearer what is happening if someone attempts to set RISE min_interval to < 3. I see you set some other classifiers to contract train time for 1 minute, were there any issues understanding what the RISE parameter did exactly?

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/845965167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4779422270,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc3OTQyMjI3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4779422270","actor":{"login":"gulstein86","id":21325864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzI1ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21325864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86","html_url":"https://github.com/gulstein86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-21T13:51:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4779422274,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3Nzk0MjIyNzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4779422274","actor":{"login":"gulstein86","id":21325864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzI1ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21325864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86","html_url":"https://github.com/gulstein86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-21T13:51:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/846025870","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/895#issuecomment-846025870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/895","id":846025870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjAyNTg3MA==","user":{"login":"gulstein86","id":21325864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzI1ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21325864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86","html_url":"https://github.com/gulstein86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gulstein86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-21T15:16:17Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T
