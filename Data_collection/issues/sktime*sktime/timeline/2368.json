Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nCloses #2387\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nI have added a new argument 'return_tags' to the registry function all_estimators().  'return_tags' is an optional argument, either a str or list of str of tag names the user wants returned for all estimators returned.  If provided all_estimators will return each estimator's value for each tag in 'return_tags' or else None if the estimator doesn't have that tag.  I also added a new test to ensure all_estimators works if 'return_tags' is passed as a str or list of str. (the default - None is tested in other tests!)\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n -->\r\nDoes this address the issue suggested?  Any test cases I should add?  Any other feedback?

[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass

Also add the `use_bias` parameter to output layer. (simply as a customisation option to users, multiple linear layers are useful to create deeper networks depending on dataset / choice of activation function)\r\n- [x] option to choose optimiser (usually its Adam but just for customisation's sake we can give this as option as well). Also should allow specifying `lr` either within the optimiser or as parameter to the class itself.\r\n- [x] Accept parameter as input in `CNNClassifier` to specify `random seed`\r\n- [ ] Train/fit the model on GPU depending on users choice (maybe take an input parameter for this as well)\r\n- [x] Option to view / return the loss of fit (either as a graph or simply as a list / array )\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
