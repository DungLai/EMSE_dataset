this is right, critical difference diagrams are already implemented. Initially, I was relying on [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/) for the CD plots. At some point it was decided that we didn't want Orange as a dependency in sktime and @mloning implemented the method that you are referring to. I think the method does exactly what @TonyBagnall is describing but you can maybe double check that it behaves as you expect before closing the
