implemented a pyWATTS Wrapper (https://github.com/benHeid/sktime/blob/pywatts_wrapper/sktime/forecasting/pywatts.py) as a Transformer. And tested it with a very simple pipeline (https://github.com/benHeid/sktime/blob/pywatts_wrapper/example_pywatts.py). \r\n\r\nI identify the following open questions:\r\n* How do we merge the y and the X input that are provided to fit, since the pywatts pipeline does only expect one data input (with potentially multiple columns).\r\n* Is it a good way to implement such a wrapper as a transformer. Because sometimes the pipeline needs to be fitted. I solve this by overriding the `fit` method of the transformer.\r\n* It is important that the input provided to `fit` and `_transform` is a pandas DataFrame since the pywatts pipeline needs column names to provide the correct data to the correct modules/(transformer) inside of the pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n* I only tested the very simple scenario. I am not sure if this works with multiple output columns, input columns etc.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1177725713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"benHeid","id":9725296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjUyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9725296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid","html_url":"https://github.com/benHeid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6959652822,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5NCDsNzwAAAAGe09_W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6959652822","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-08T12:06:39Z","project_card":{"id":83813784,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/83813784","project_id":14463575,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/14463575","column_name":"In
