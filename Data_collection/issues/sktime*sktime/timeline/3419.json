Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #3419 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nAs described in the bug, the `update` routine does not update the `residuals_matrix` which means the conformal intervals will be incorrect on the updated data. This PR computes the sliding residuals on the remaining part of the `residuals_matrix` in the case of an update.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new rows and new columns populated for the new rows, but does not extend the existing rows as it stands. Is this an acceptable approximation? The way it is used this will only matter where old rows are not extending the length of the forecasting horizon.
