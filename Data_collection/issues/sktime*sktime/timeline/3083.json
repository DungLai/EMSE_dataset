PR is a refactor of the `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier`.\r\n\r\nIt does three things:\r\n* removes the (in my opinion) awkward and hard-to-maintain double inheritance of `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` from `sklearn`'s knn classifier. Instead adopts a wrapper pattern around the `sklearn` public interface, with much of the code simplified through passing distance matrices directly to `sklearn`.\r\n* extends the interface to allow passing of arbitrary distances that are callables. This supports the composable distance interface from #1858 out-of-the-box (with `sklearn` style parameter inspectable composition/pipelining), and can be used to plug in custom time series distances.\r\n* tests that rely on random seeds are updated with new expected output values\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes two unreported bugs:\r\n* the `algorithm` parameter of `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` was not passed to the `sklearn` `KNeighbors` classifier, the value being passed was always the default `\"brute\"`. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2774\r\n* corrected docstring in `pairwise_distance` which was missing options\r\n\r\nand makes one minor change:\r\n* replaces loops in tests for `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` by `mark.parametrize`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1193317811","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3083#issuecomment-1193317811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3083","id":1193317811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HIJWz","user":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-24T13:23:14Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T13:23:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This
