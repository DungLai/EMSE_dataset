@blazingbhavneek, that's indeed an interesting question.\r\n\r\nI would go ahead and first just interface the `numpy` method, and use the `iloc` index rather than the `loc` index. This should be said clearly in the docstring, and it will result in an evenly-spaced sequence/signal.\r\n\r\nDiscrete Fourier transforms are defined on a non-equally-spaced signal as well, typically this is generalized by taking the delta signal supported at the indices in the general form of the (non-discrete) Fourier transform, although it is less common in practice afaik.\r\n\r\nFor the latter, I would suggest:\r\n\r\n* start with the `iloc` one first, this is a straightforward interfacing task. Get it merged, there's already enough to deal with in terms of code formatting, CI, getting PR merged, etc, which is not content but just open source, GitHub & code convention related.\r\n* in a second step, if you like, you can add non-equally spaced DFT. My approach would actually be a little \"trick\" where you stick the additional phase from the unequal spacing in the complex part of the coefficients. As `numpy` can deal with complex coefficients, that should (I hope) work? I would switch via a transformer parameter, e.g., `indexing` that can be `\"iloc\"` or `\"loc\"`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1372662745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8163398716,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5RmThEzwAAAAHmk5Q8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8163398716","actor":{"login":"blazingbhavneek","id":86467990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDY3OTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86467990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek","html_url":"https://github.com/blazingbhavneek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-05T19:52:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8163398722,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5RmThEzwAAAAHmk5RC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8163398722","actor":{"login":"blazingbhavneek","id":86467990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDY3OTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86467990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek","html_url":"https://github.com/blazingbhavneek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blazingbhavneek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-05T19:52:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
