thank you for bringing this to our attention, FYI @mloning, @aiwalter.\r\n\r\nA complication is that we are potentially looking towards extensions that allow multi-index rows (FYI @ltsaprounis, @satya-pattnaik).\r\n\r\nHow about the following alternative suggestion: if an index name is passed with a `pd.DataFrame` or a `pd.Series`, we always strip it off before it reaches anything.\r\n\r\nThat would require adding a restriction to our data container specification\r\n(see here for the input type specifications https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/AA_datatypes_and_datasets.ipynb )\r\nwhich says that the \"official\" input specification does not have index names.\r\n\r\nThis would results in inputs being assumed without index name, and outputs having no index name.\r\nOf course, we can provide convenience input coercion functionality, so on input no error is raised but it's instead considered as (and coerced to) the same container without the index name.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/932500161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5396429728,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc48Z1D8zwAAAAFBpvug","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5396429728","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T19:36:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5396429729,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc48Z1D8zwAAAAFBpvuh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5396429729","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T19:36:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5396429732,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc48Z1D8zwAAAAFBpvuk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5396429732","actor":{"login":"satya-pattnaik","id":22102468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTAyNDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22102468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik","html_url":"https://github.com/satya-pattnaik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T19:36:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5396429735,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc48Z1D8zwAAAAFBpvun","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5396429735","actor":{"login":"satya-pattnaik","id":22102468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTAyNDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuse
