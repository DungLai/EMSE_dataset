think we need to revisit the input/output type convention for transformers and forecasters.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have output = input mtype, e.g., `pd.DataFrame` input results in `pd.DataFrame` output, `dask_series` input results in `dask_series` output, etc. Let's call this convention A.\r\n\r\nA while ago, we agreed that this would change to \"all output is `pd.DataFrame` based, no matter the input\", although we never got round to implement it. Let's call this convention B.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at delayed computation, it seems to me that convention A allows to have delayed chains of computations throughout pipelines without problems, assuming all pipeline elements support `dask`. Whereas, convention B would break the chain at every component.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think, we should reconsider our decision to move to convention B, and stay with convention A instead?\r\n\r\nFYI

use `X` as a placeholder for the hard dependency libraries currently used in scikit-time, with $X \\in \\{scipy, numba, sklearn, statemodel, pandas\\}$\r\n\r\n@fkiraly is a strong advocate of soft
