MA stands for moving average.\r\n> \r\n> Use any of the ARIMA models in `sktime` with `p=0` and `d=0`. The `q` parameter determines the order of the moving average. More precisely, ARIMA (0, 0, q) = MA(q).\r\n\r\nHi @fkiraly , This may not work for 2 reasons.\r\n\r\n1. ARIMA MA part relies on model errors from past points and not the raw y values ([Ref](https://otexts.com/fpp3/MA.html)).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/209449355-b16be36c-5d49-4ead-93da-affcd067ea57.png)\r\n\r\nHence, after crossing future points > q, it will not be able to predict ([Link to Code](https://gist.github.com/ngupta23/4aaab9205ef3de3921c3a5a580f7701d)). \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/209449181-f753c180-de06-4fd6-b277-1a6a9e886c4e.png)\r\n\r\n2. Even if it was working,, it does not provide any control over the coefficients of the model so the past 'q' points would be weighted differently (theta values in the equation above) depending on how the model gets fitted.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a Simple Moving Average where all past q points are weighted equally. This would be a starting (baseline) model, then I would add additional complexity on top of that iteratively to see what helps to improve the model. This could include for example, building more features beyond a simple moving average (e.g. lags, standard deviations, mins, max, etc) or changing out the regressor to more complex ones so see if they help. Hence, a working baseline solution using regressors would be helpful to have. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1364576917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8107774198,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5aAzglzwAAAAHjQtD2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8107774198","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-24T19:49:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8107774200,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5aAzglzwAAAAHjQtD4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8107774200","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-24T19:49:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1364577331","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3992#issuecomment-1364577331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3992","id":1364577331,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5RVcwz","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-24T19:53:58Z","updated_at":"2022-12-24T19:53:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"oh,

For long horizons, that is correct (similar to what ARMA models would produce). But for short horizons, they can still produce reasonable baseline results. The key there is the selection of an appropriate window size (not too short as that can result in constant forecasts even in the short term). The definition of \"short term\" of course is business dependent and will vary based on frequency of data (monthly vs. weekly) and so will the appropriate selection of the MA window size.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/209472450-3d10c80b-4d58-47f8-bfce-03dd5aa3c850.png)\r\n\r\nBut I think we are digressing from the original intent of this request.
