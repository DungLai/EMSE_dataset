num_channels_per_combination is randomly generated but the seed is not set\r\n\r\nThis is my oversight, sorry.  The seed should be set (or, should be able to be set) here.\r\n\r\n> it is very hard to read\r\n\r\nAgain, my bad.  If I get time at some point, I'll try to clean it up.  If there's a particular section (e.g., channel assignment) which is a problem, I'm happy to try to explain it.  (There's a bigger picture here, which is that `MiniRocketMultivariate` is really only intended to provide basic multivariate functionality for MiniRocket.  However, I don't have a time frame for when we might be able to add better multivariate support.)\r\n\r\n[edit: I should add, there's another issue which I haven't had the chance to address yet, in that MiniRocketMultivariate is approximately 10x slower than 'it should be', that's another thing on the to do list.] \r\n\r\n> there are no tests for it\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure there are tests in `.../transformations/panel/tests/test_MiniRocketMultivariate.py`, although maybe I'm misunderstanding what's meant here.\r\n\r\n> ```python\r\n> if seed is not None:\r\n>         np.random.seed(seed)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThis is probably the best fix for the moment (see next comment).\r\n\r\n> ```python\r\n> rng = check_random_state(random_state)\r\n> random_int = rng.randint()\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThis would work here, as the channel assignment is done outside Numba.  However, in the background we have the same old problem that Numba has it's own way of handling random, and you can't pass a random state into/out of Numba code (which is why MiniRocket/MiniRocketMultivariate are limited to using integer seeds).  As such, if we went with this approach for channel assignment, we'd have one way of handling the seed/random state for one part of the code (sampling bias values) and another way of handling the seed/random state for another part of the code (channel assignment).  Accordingly, I'd be inclined to go with the `if seed is not None: ...` approach above, for simplicity/consistency.  Having said that, I don't really have a strong view on it, I'd be happy either way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/868000184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"angus924","id":55837131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODM3MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55837131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924","html_url":"https://github.com/angus924","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/868337102","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1041#issuecomment-868337102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1041","id":868337102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODMzNzEwMg==","user":{"login":"Lovkush-A","id":25344832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQ0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25344832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A","html_url":"https://github.com/Lovkush-A","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-25T08:56:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T08:56:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> If there's a particular section (e.g., channel assignment) which is a problem, I'm happy to try to explain it.\r\n\r\nI only spent ~10 minutes reading the code (mainly to understand the seeding issue) and I had a skim of the accompanying paper, and it might just be a case of the algorithm itself is not easy to understand if you first do not know rocket (note I do not know anything about rocket).\r\n\r\nAn example of something hard to understand without prior knowledge is what the different variables mean, e.g. what do `A`, `G` or `C_alpha` mean.

for the slow reply.\r\n\r\nThanks very much @Lovkush-A.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I would say about refactoring is that as one of the main attributes (or claims, at least) in relation to MiniRocket is in relation to speed/scalability (i.e., that it is fast), it would be important to make sure that the refactored code is at least as fast as the original code.  (The complicating factor here is that the code doing all of the real work is Numba-compiled code, which may make this tricky.)  People, understandably, are likely to treat the sktime implementation as official/matching the published version.\r\n\r\nHaving said that:\r\n- even if only the non-Numba/plain python code was revised, this might be worthwhile; and\r\n- as I mentioned somewhere above, the multivariate version of MiniRocket is actually quite a bit slower than 'it should be' (like-for-like, compared to the univariate version), so there may be room to make a big improvement, but it's not really important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/869697585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"angus924","id":55837131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODM3MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55837131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924","html_url":"https://github.com/angus924","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4947556014,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk0NzU1NjAxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4947556014","actor":{"login":"Lovkush-A","id":25344832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQ0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25344832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A","html_url":"https://github.com/Lovkush-A","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-28T13:44:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4947556024,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5NDc1NTYwMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4947556024","actor":{"login":"Lovkush-A","id":25344832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQ0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25344832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A","html_url":"https://github.com/Lovkush-A","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-28T13:44:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/869706983","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1041#issuecomment-869706983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1041","id":869706983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTcwNjk4Mw==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T13:56:21Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T13:57:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Quick
