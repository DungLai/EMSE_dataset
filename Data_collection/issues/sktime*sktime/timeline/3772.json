See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nFixes #3772\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThe problem was in `toctree` part of the `.rst` file.

If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments.

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
