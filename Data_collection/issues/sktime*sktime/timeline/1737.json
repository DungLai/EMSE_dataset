Sorry for the lag in response, it wasn't straightforward.\r\n\r\nI think that indeed it fits really nicely with the design and the roadmap, thanks for the great suggestions!\r\n\r\nHistorically, much of the functionality was written around the assumption of equal indices for all variables. It was a conscious decision by the core developer majority to cut corners there, in order to build the toolbox more quickly for that common use case (and I won't say here who had which opinion in the discussion ðŸ˜„). Due to the discussion, we've kept the design open to consolidation into the unequal/irregular case.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, I think indeed we need to make `sktime` more robust in cases where the indices across variables are unequal, or indices are even irregular. At least, when they are not equal between `X` and `y`. The tag `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` was introduced defensively with this in mind, to designate estimators which make the assumption that you are not making.\r\n\r\nRegarding implementation, I think what you suggest makes a lot of sense. I think things fit together as follows:\r\n* in splitting and `evaluate`, and related functionality, we need to move from index based logic to \"select before cut-off\" logic that works for time series whether they are equally spaced or equal between variables, or not. This would be your option to modify exitsing functionality, and ensuring to keep it downwards compatible.\r\n* the disaggregation can be treated by a transformer (not forecaster!), that re-samples or aggregates the data to any frequency, bins, or indices desired. A `ResamplingTransformer` or similar would be great, it should transform series to series.\r\n* Such a transformer can then finally be used in any pipeline. The current ones should hopefully work out of the box, although I've described a \"nicer\" version of our current pipelines which unifies multiple compositors we have, see here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1174 ... in case you want a challenge. If this is of interest, have a quick chat with @aiwalter who had this on his plate but hasn't found time for the re-work yet.\r\n* the pipeline as described can apply a forecasting step to `X`, so covers your requirement to produce `X_test`. Alternatively, you could think of a `ForecasterTransformer` which wraps a forecaster, and *adds* the forecasts to `X`, instead of just returning those.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, I would suggest picking one of the three items and writing down a design (draft docstrings of functions or classes after the change/addition).\r\nIf you'd like to join our regular forecasting stand-ups, we have free space for 15min technical discussion every Friday in the \"forecasting\" session (after the stand-up) and can also schedule a longer technical meeting if you think design discussion would be helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/992019933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5753617695,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5ALVvwzwAAAAFW8T0f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5753617695","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-13T01:09:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5753617697,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5ALVvwzwAAAAFW8T0h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5753617697","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-13T01:09:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/992021558","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1737#issuecomment-992021558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1737","id":992021558,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc47IQw2","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-13T01:12:23Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T01:12:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"FYI

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1737\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- All splitters now accept not only integer, but also `timedelta` or `pd.DateOffset` for `initial_window`, `window_length`, and `step_length` arguments. No regression was introduced. The core changes are localized to `sktime/forecasting/model_selection/_split.py`.\r\n- All existing tests (`sktime/forecasting/model_selection/tests/test_split.py`) are only enriched for additional argument types. Test cases boil down to adding new types in `sktime/forecasting/tests/_config.py`. See variables `TEST_WINDOW_LENGTHS`, `TEST_INITIAL_WINDOW`, and `TEST_STEP_LENGTHS`.\r\n- I could not resist and added type hints in `sktime/forecasting/base/_fh.py` although it is not necessary for the core change. I added type hints to `_split.py` first, but for completeness I needed type hint for forecasting horizon which triggered the change in `_fh.py`.\r\n- `sktime/forecasting/model_evaluation/tests/test_evaluate.py` was only changed to preserve original tests. Other changes are automatic commit hooks. Same for `sktime/forecasting/model_selection/tests/test_tune.py`, `sktime/forecasting/tests/test_naive.py`, and `sktime/forecasting/tests/test_all_forecasters.py`.\r\n- In `sktime/utils/validation/__init__.py` and `sktime/utils/validation/forecasting.py` I have added a few validations for new types.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nThe focus of this PR are the new types of above mentioned arguments. There are relatively a lot of changes, but all of them are triggered by this generalization.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is the first, but hopefully, logically complete batch of changes. I have a much bigger target in mind (see #1737). Personally, I prefer smaller PRs, hence I would prefer to stop here and address other required changes (like generalization of `ForecastHorizon`) in another PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

discussed with @TonyBagnall, this PR upgrades the base classifier class refactor #1594 to use the existing checks and coercions in `datatypes` instead of the new, custom functions written by @TonyBagnall.\r\n\r\nIt is based on #1745 (merged) and #1748 (not yet merged), which in turn have some routines by @TonyBagnall from #1594 moved into the `datatypes` module (e.g., inferring the data characteristics for certain mtypes).\r\n\r\nNote: this is a PR into the other PR, not into `main`.\r\n\r\nA lot of files appear changed, that's because #1745 (merged in `main`) and #1748 (not merged in main) are not yet part of #1594. To see the \"real\" diffs (localized to `BaseClassifier` and small of size), #1748 needs to be merged with `main`, and #1594 needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nReviewers of this PR can hence focus

More test cases are added in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection.tests.test_split.test_cutoff_window_splitter`.\r\n\r\nMore detailed description of changes:\r\n- Reused type checking functions from `sktime/utils/validation/__init__.py` in `sktime.forecasting.base._fh._check_values`.\r\n- Added `pd.TimedeltaIndex` to `RELATIVE_TYPES` in `sktime/forecasting/base/_fh.py` to allow timdelta forecasting horizons.\r\n- Added `pd.TimedeltaIndex` to `VALID_INDEX_TYPES` in `sktime/utils/validation/series.py` to allow timdelta forecasting horizons.\r\n- Added `TEST_CUTOFFS` to `sktime/forecasting/tests/_config.py` so that all splitter test configurations are collected in one place.\r\n- Added `TEST_FHS_TIMEDELTA` to `sktime/forecasting/tests/_config.py`. These are timedelta forecasting horizons used in test cases for `CutoffSplitter`.\r\n- Made `sktime.utils.validation.tests.test_forecasting.test_check_fh_empty_input` more precise by adding `match` argument to `raises`.\r\n- Added a few new type checking functions in `sktime/utils/validation/__init__.py` which are used in splitters and corresponding tests.\r\n- Generalized `sktime.utils.validation.forecasting.check_cutoffs` to allow datetime cutoffs.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

This potentially allows passing non-equally spaced time series. Right now this possibility is still not tested. Note that no existing tests were changed in the process.\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n- Remove usage of `_coerce_duration_to_int(duration=x, freq=\"D\")` in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseWindowSplitter.get_cutoffs`. This function obviously gives a wrong `step_length` if frequency of `y` is not `D`.\r\n- Replace `np.arange` in `CutoffSplitter._split`, `BaseWindowSplitter._split`, `SlidingWindowSplitter._split_windows`, `ExpandingWindowSplitter._split_windows`, and `SingleWindowSplitter._split`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

Along the way I realized that there are too many possible combinations of input parameters to treat at the same time. So, a better strategy would be to generalize in very small steps. In this PR I simply raise a `TypeError` if input arguments are either not all ints (as before I started working on #1737), or not all timedelta/dateoffset. I do this check immediately at the initialization of splitter objects. Tests are added to check that the exception is risen.\r\n\r\nNote that I have also replaced `TEST_WINDOW_LENGTHS` (includes ints and timedeltas) with `TEST_WINDOW_LENGTHS_INT` (only ints) in `sktime.forecasting.tests.test_all_forecasters.TestAllForecasters.test_update_predict_predicted_index` to restore the original set of tests existed before the work on #1737 has started.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this PR I added `TEST_FHS_TIMEDELTA` test cases to  `sktime.forecasting.base.tests.test_fh.test_fh`. In order to pass the tests two changes were required in `ForecastingHorizon` itself: in `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon._is_in_sample` and in `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon._is_out_of_sample`. Both methods perform comparison with zero which in case of `pd.Timdelta` values should actually be `pd.Timedelta(0)`.\r\n\r\nNote that `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon.to_indexer` returns `None` in the new timedelta case. I have no idea what this method should return in this case. Any suggestions are very much welcome.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have silenced the pre-commit error from (described here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2338) by using `# noqa: B019` next to the `@lru_cache` decorator.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNext step in #1737 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Test SingleWindowSplitter with Timedelta forecasting horizon. That is, add `TEST_FHS_TIMEDELTA` to tests cases in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection.tests.test_split.test_single_window_splitter` and in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection.tests.test_split.test_single_window_splitter_default_window_length`.\r\n\r\n`_get_end` function now returns the value which can be directly used with either `.loc` or `iloc` indexing. For that the value is `-2` relative to the original version. This change makes the function more intuitive. `_get_end` function is used in:\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseWindowSplitter._split`. I added 2 to offset the change.\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseWindowSplitter.get_cutoffs`. I added 2 to offset the change.\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.SingleWindowSplitter._split`. I added 1 directly where it is used (now `end = _get_end(y, fh)`) and one more 1 in calculation of integer `start` (now `start = end - window_length + 1`).\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.SingleWindowSplitter.get_cutoffs`. I have added 2 (now `end = _get_end(y, fh)`).\r\n\r\nNo external changes were made. Tests are the same plus added more test cases for Timedelta forecasting horizons.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNext step in #1737\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReplace `np.arange` usage in cross-validation splitters with `np.argwhere`. This potentially allows passing non-equally spaced time series.\r\n\r\nIn addition I could not resist not to clean up a bit `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseWindowSplitter._split`. There I have extracted a separate method `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseWindowSplitter._split_for_initial_window` to make code a bit more readable.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
