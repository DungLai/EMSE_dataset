issue #1845, an instance of a `statsmodels` interfacing estimator was discovered which was missing crucial parameters.\r\n\r\nThe reason was that in `statsmodels`, model parameteres are spread out across constructor (`__init__`), `fit`, and potentially other functions.\r\n\r\nDue to this, it would be important to look at other `statsmodels` interfaces to check whether we are missing useful parameters from non-constructor methods.\r\n\r\nIf we are, a notice here would already be useful. Further, these should be added to the constructor (not `fit` etc) of the corresponding `sktime` interface. A \"blueprint\" PR to carry out this addition of parameters is #1849 (for Holt-Winters smoothing).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6306256852,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc5DoodvzwAAAAF34dfU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6306256852","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-25T10:29:34Z","label":{"name":"interfacing
