would seem that `pytest-xdist` is behind:\r\n* the so far undiagnosed, major CI/CD issue https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1941 which caused us so much trouble after the CI/CD refactor, and days of work just to track down the test which it interacted with. See https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2004\r\n* a newly emergent issue of random worker crashes after an innocuous move to testing classes, in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1992. See #1999 and https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2003\r\n* issues that I face in local testing on my windows machine - after a number of runs, vs code crashes; also, it creates a number of stray processes which eat memory and have to be killed manually\r\n\r\nThis indicates to me that `pytest-xdist` is still a bit immature, and at risk of causing unexplainable, hard to diagnose CI/CD issues. Do we really know when it strikes next, or how corretness of the tests is impacted?\r\n\r\nI do think, hence, that we should remove it from our CI/CD set-up.\r\nThe cost is, roughly, a doubling of CI/CD time, since the current set-up uses test parallelization with 2 workers.\r\n\r\nFYI

testing under Ubuntu 20 WSL suggests the following:\r\n\r\n1. Main culprit is some hard to identify interaction between pytest-xdist (with n>1, e.g. n=2), pytest-cov and joblib. What is clear, this is not memory leak, or some other excessive resource usage, it appears to be \"deadlock\". \r\n\r\nRest of commentary focused on the:\r\n[`sktime/tests/test_all_estimators.py::TestAllEstimators::test_multiprocessing_idempotent`\r\n](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/be65769f1c7e5536d77025ca91d008f5b1a7177b/sktime/tests/test_all_estimators.py#L975)\r\n\r\nWhich is currently skipped but was un-skipped for testing.\r\n\r\nHang ups stop if:\r\n- `-n 2` is dropped in the invocation of pytest which is equivalent to \"no xdist\"\r\n- or `--cov=sktime` is dropped so no coverage report\r\n- or -k \"not fresh\" which is equivalent to dropping all of the test variants of `{TSFreshClassifier TSFreshFeatureExtractor FreshPRINCE} `\r\n\r\n3. Observation (htop with python filter) suggests that at some point when tests hit one of the \"fresh\" as above (with `--cov=sktime` and `-n 2`) all CPU activity stops -> deadlock. \r\n - Sometimes after hours (3+h) of waiting it snaps out, but for most tests I didn't wait beyond ~5 min.\r\n - Related issue here in [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/492)\r\n\r\n5. For now practical change will be to separate\r\n- `test_all_estimators.py::TestAllEstimators::test_multiprocessing_idempotent` out and test it independent of all the other tests with xdist disabled = remove `-n 2`. \r\n- rest of the tests can be done with xdist on `-n=2` e.g. with `-k \"not test_multiprocessing_idempotent\".  Which means mostly changes to the [Makefile](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/41a5ae9c70a3fafba89304d8025b969a84de818a/Makefile#L31)\r\n\r\ne.g. below snippet \r\n - line 1 `test_multiprocessing_idempotent` only with**out** coverage and xdist\r\n - line 2 without `test_multiprocessing_idempotent` with coverage and xdist\r\n```\r\ncd ${TEST_DIR}; python -m pytest -v --showlocals --durations=20 --pyargs $(PACKAGE) -k \"test_multiprocessing_idempotent\"\r\ncd ${TEST_DIR}; python -m pytest --cov-report html --cov=sktime -v -n 2 --showlocals --durations=20 --pyargs $(PACKAGE) -k \"not test_multiprocessing_idempotent\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis misses the coverage report for `test_multiprocessing_idempotent` but at least we are testing it :)\r\n- Skipping xdist for `test_multiprocessing_idempotent` makes sense anyway since it's using joblib internally so does what xdist is meant to do.\r\n- Skipping coverage for `test_multiprocessing_idempotent` till we figure out why there is problem.\r\n\r\n7. Suggestion is at some point investigate deeper why exactly this happens...\r\n\r\nPR coming up
