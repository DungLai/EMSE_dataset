the discussion is separated over two threads.\r\n* To get back on your question, I reorder the levels at the end `.reorder_levels([\"day\", \"week\"])`.

I think this is not optimal.\r\n    * I pass a variable, do not check to the BaseForecaster super class, it skips the check.\r\n      This requires only changes on the BaseForecaster class and an additional flag on \r\n      TransformedTargetForecaster, ForecastingPipeline and maybe ReconcilerForecaster.\r\n    * A solution, similar to above, would be to only execute _check_X_y for forecaster which do computations and use X and y.\r\n      `f = Week()*(Week()**ReconcilerForecaster(SARIMAX(), method='td_fcst'))`\r\n      In the above, this is SARIMAX. Here X has to match y.  You could pass a flag that for SARIMAX X has to match y.\r\n      It is not the case for ReconcilerForecaster. Here possibly a forecasting pipeline could be passed,\r\n      which contains a transformation that ensures X and y are aligned.\r\n      Note that this solution is very similar to the second solution.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1313344568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RikStarmans","id":109525630,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoc6fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109525630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans","html_url":"https://github.com/RikStarmans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1315630343","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3776#issuecomment-1315630343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3776","id":1315630343,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Oau0H","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T17:16:48Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T17:16:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"That's a very nice transformer!\r\n\r\nWe were already thinking how we could do multiple granularity disaggregation and temporal reconcilliation, it appears you figured out how to do it within the current framework (bug aside).\r\n\r\n* would be great if could make a PR with the transformer to `sktime`, that way your use case might be easier to debug (and it is nice!)\r\n* for reconciling weekly aggregates, should not the week timestamp the lowest (time-like) index, and the day of the week the second-to-last (instance-like)?

I will submit a solution along line 2.\r\n\r\nI think there are two \"principled\" ways, and we should not hack the base class (or this will lead to trouble...)\r\nBoth follow your no.2; one of them is quicker to implement.\r\n\r\n1. the \"deep\" solution is having config flags that control input and output checks. This should not happen via \"raw attributes\" but use the tag/config system. It is actually sth I'm working on.\r\n\r\n2. a shorter term solution would be introducing a tag, e.g., `\"X-y-must-have-same-scitype\"`, if it is `False`, then the check inside `_check_X_y` would be turned off (but not the entire checking machinery!)\r\nAdding a tag is slightly involved, but you can bootstrap the logic if you search for `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` in `BaseForecaster` and in the `registry` module. On current main, the key logic that applies it in forecaster checks is in line 1359 of `BaseForecaster`. Where the new tag would have to play a role is line 1365, shortly after.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1315642986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1315643390","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3776#issuecomment-1315643390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3776","id":1315643390,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Oax_-","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T17:26:59Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T17:26:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Would you like to give option 2 a try?
