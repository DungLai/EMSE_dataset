How to get started\r\nRead through our [how-to-get-started guide](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/How-to-get-started).\r\n\r\nIf you haven't done so already, watch our [online tutorial at PyData Amsterdam](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-tutorial-pydata-amsterdam-2020) to become familiar with sktime. Alternatively, work through our [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples). \r\n\r\nIf you get stuck or have a question, please comment on the relevant issue, chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/sktime/community) or the PyData discord server. \r\n\r\n## How to contribute \r\nRead our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).\r\n\r\nIt's always good to raise an issue or leave a comment on an existing issue before you start working to describe what you would like to change or implement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What to work on\r\nWe suggest a few topics to work on, but please don't hesitate to propose your own topic!\r\n\r\n### Beginner-friendly\r\n* 🔬 User testing: play around with the [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples), try to understand the code, and give us feedback! For example, which time series classifier achieves the best performance on the arrow head problem? Which forecaster achieves the best performance on the airline data set?\r\n* 📚 Improve our [online documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/api_reference.html) - many classes and methods have missing doc strings!\r\n* 📖 Improve our [example notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples) - make them more engaging and instructive.\r\n\r\n### Intermediate \r\n* ⚙️ Take a look at our [good-first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue) and pick one that interests you. \r\n* 🚧 Improve our dev ops, see #241 (dev ops skills)\r\n* 💻 Enhance our [website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime) (web development skills)\r\n\r\n### Advanced\r\n* 🧰 Create interfaces to other toolboxes like [gluon-ts](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts) or [fbprophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)\r\n* 🎨 Pick a topic from our [development roadmap](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/228) and propose an API design - for examples, see our design notes on [forecasting](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Forecasting-API-proposal) and [annotation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Time-series-annotation-API-proposal)\r\n* 🐼 Data container, check out our [introductory notebook](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-tutorial-pydata-amsterdam-2020/blob/master/notebooks/data_container.ipynb) and [design discussion](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Time-series-data-container)\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Follow-up projects\r\nOur goal, apart from improving sktime, is to onboard new contributors and we would really like you to stay around after the sprint. We're actively looking for new contributors and your help is extremely welcome!\r\n\r\n### What we offer\r\nWe have an active community of researchers and students who work on sktime, and we offer an informal mentorship programme over the summer in which we help you become more familiar with machine learning, time series analysis and open-source software development. The programme would involve weekly calls with your mentor. \r\n\r\n### What we expect \r\nYou can choose a project to work on and we can help you to find an interesting topic. In addition to the individual project work, all students will be expected to:\r\n* peer-review fellow contributors' work,\r\n* write a blog post about your contribution,\r\n* socialise with other students and contributors. \r\n\r\nPlease get in touch if you're interested!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-17T16:28:34Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T16:28:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/345","id":659401678,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTk0MDE2Nzg=","number":345,"title":"Extend

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the reduction meta-estimators only handle univariate data (we raise a not-implemented error [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/979aed585983fb820ddb0ca8a619d5730dbed4a7/sktime/forecasting/compose/_reduce.py#L67)). We need to extend it to support multivariate time series data. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n* Use temporal cross-validation iterator to transform multivariate time series into data frame with lagged values and vector with target values. Currently, the transformation happens [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/979aed585983fb820ddb0ca8a619d5730dbed4a7/sktime/forecasting/compose/_reduce.py#L73). \r\n* The `x_windows` list needs to be extended to contain the data from all series. \r\n* The different formatting of the windows for reduction to time series and tabular regression needs to be adapted too to

number of good issues to start working on as a new contributor.\r\nContributions to documentation are especially appreciated.\r\n\r\n### getting started with contributions\r\n\r\n1. Say hello [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sktime-group/shared_invite/zt-62i7aejn-vXc3nOWF26S_P3VXFPWisQ) and get set up for development, see [instructions in the developer guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/developer_guide.html)\r\n2. Pick a “good first issue” to work on, see a collection [in this summary issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1147), or from [this list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue)\r\nsuggestion: pick something small with simple content to learn the “process”\r\n3. Feel free to attend the regular community collab sessions or one of the topic specific stand-ups and tech sessions (see schedule on slack)\r\n4. Once your first PR is merged and you’ve seen how things work, think about your regular time commitment. Optionally, continue attending the Friday community collaboration sessions and stand-ups; or, optionally, [apply for mentoring](https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/README.md)\r\n\r\n### introductory and user testing\r\n\r\n* work through the [sktime tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) and record feedback, you can post it in this issue #1447\r\n* work through user testing sheets for [forecasting](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_forecasting.ipynb) or [time series classification](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_TSC.ipynb), record feedback and send us your user testing sheet with code (e.g., attach to this issue)\r\n* open an issue with a time series related algorithm that you would like to see implemented or interfaced in `sktime`\r\n* work through the [installation instructions](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/installation.html) to install a development version of `sktime`. Record carefully things that are unclear or don't work as described, return the full feedback to us (e.g., in an issue).\r\n\r\n### contributors new to open source\r\n\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing module and class/function docstrings. Pick a file and start adding these. A good starting point are estimator algorithms, these should follow the general documentation style outlined in #1148 or the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). If you start, post the name of the estimator you are working on in #1148; when you open a PR, refer to the issue.\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing examples. Pick a file and start adding these. a good starting point are estimator algorithms, and time series classifiers, see #932 and #1148\r\n\r\nNOTE: #1148 and #932 are closed, but there are still modules without good docstrings. They are just no longer tracked by the issue, which covered the priority items only. So, feel free to go through the code base and help improve docstrings!\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium documentation and technical writing tasks\r\n\r\n* other smaller issues in the [documentation milestone](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/milestone/6)\r\n* the [user guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/user_guide.html) is incomplete. Help is appreciated - the best approach may be converting the [tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) in a well-written guide.\r\n* the [tutorial for time series classification](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) should be re-factored, in the style of the forecasting tutorial\r\n* extension templates for time series regression and time series annotation should be written. The current [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates) can be used as an extension template template.\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium python/coding tasks\r\n\r\n* current open small tasks with a \"recipe\": https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/3429\r\n* pick an unverified bug from the bugfixing board: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/18 and try to reproduce it. Post operating system, python version and (if relevant) package versions, and whether you can yes/no. Investigate further if the bug looks simple - but note that bugs can be anywhere between easy to very difficult to track down.\r\n* Pick an algorithm to implement or interface, according to the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). Possible choices are forecasters (univariate or multivariate), time series classifiers, time series regressors, annotators, distances, kernels - these can be existing feature requests, or new suggestions. We currently do not recommend transformers as they undergo refactoring.\r\n* implement `get_fitted_params` functionality in estimators where this is missing (currently most of them). Related issue for composite estimators: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1497\r\n\r\n### mid to longer term tasks\r\n\r\nFor contributing across a period of weeks or months, consider joining one of the major workstreams and weekly stand-ups on Fridays.

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nTemporal aggregation aggregates high-frequency time series into lower frequency time series using a fixed nonoverlapping window. For example, we can aggregate daily time series into weekly time series using a window of length 7. Temporal aggregation in different levels can strengthen or attenuate different features of the time series, and thus reveal import  information about the data generating process.\r\nCurrently, there are similar forecasting strategies such as `makereduction` using a overlapping sliding-window, but there are not similar methods in transformer.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd temporal aggregation transformer. User can specify the window (e.g. `6` for monthly time series to produce half-year time series)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTemporal aggregation has been explored widely in forecasting literatures. There are multiple forecasting methods(e.g. MAPA, iMAPA, ADIDA) that combine  forecasts from multiple aggregation levels, which improve forecasting accuracy and decrease uncertainty. But they cannot be implemented in sktime elegantly because aggregated series in different levels have different length, also see #230 and Unequal length data in roadmap  #228.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/985896217","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/228#issuecomment-985896217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/228","id":985896217,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc46w5UZ","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-03T22:55:37Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T22:55:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closed in favour of new roadmap planning: https://github.com/sktime/community-org/blob/main/meetups/previous_meetings/20211203-roadmap-planning.md","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/985896217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5714765134,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc4hZrojzwAAAAFUoGVO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5714765134","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-03T22:55:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
