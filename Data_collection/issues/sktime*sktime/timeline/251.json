What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nMajor refactoring and clean up of existing functionality: \r\n- [x] folder reorganisation #229 \r\n- [x] sklearn-compatibility checks, run sklearn's [estimator checks](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html?highlight=rolling%20your%20own%20estimator)\r\n- [x] consistent input checks for TSC #98 \r\n- [x] consistent unit checks for TSC #251 \r\n- [x] consistent is-fitted checks for TSC\r\n- [x] inherit from sktime's BaseEstimator\r\n- [x] linting #256 \r\n- [x] fix warnings\r\n\r\n#### Comments \r\nI had to remove a few classes which I couldn't make compliant with the basic scikit-learn API without major work, including\r\n* `transformers/spectral_based`, see #224 for refactoring and adding it back \r\n* removed our version of `GridSearchCV` as it was essentially the same as the one in scikit-learn\r\n* `HomogeneousColumnEnsembleClassifier`, but we still have the more flexible `ColumnEnsembleClassifier`\r\n* removed optional `check_input` kwarg (or parameter passed to fit)\r\n* moved strategies and tasks from `highlevel/` to `benchmarking/`, removed `highlevel/`\r\n* removed our `Pipeline`, but sklearn's pipeline should be fully compatible","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3392875658,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MzM5Mjg3NTY1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3392875658","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-01T12:19:18Z","milestone":{"title":"v0.4.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3852860633,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg1Mjg2MDYzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3852860633","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-07T23:15:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
