think we should also recreate at least a subset of the forecasting bakeoff too, with code released :) One action for this is to get it installed on our cluster. I can then push through the bakeoff as each classifier is implemented in parallel to the java bakeoff for the new release of the TSC archive, which would be nice. Currently, my group can pool 2000 jobs on UEA's cluster, so we can run this pretty fast. I'm not sure how long I will maintain such a generous allowance. Also, getting code from languages like python running on different platforms where we cannot control what packages are installed can be difficult. Our cluster is also not well supported, so if we need stuff installed it will take a long time. So, an early action for Jason for this could be to test on the cluster, and for me to black box test vs Java version (there will be differences due to different RNG, but there should not be a significant difference over resamples).

We have an informal assignment of roles in our research group for porting the algorithms. The first stage will involve making scikit-learn compatible classifiers for the HIVE-COTE components using our current best implementations. My goal is to get a version running and results coming out prior to the march meeting, so we can present at least a partial bakeoff comparison (and in fact probably some significant improvement, we have some unreported advances).  Jason oversees the merging of the scikit versions into the package as a whole. Jason and I to oversee algorithm development and design decisions. We will put estimated times to these when we are all up to speed with the set up, including cluster runs. Dawak is a conference with a mid march deadline, so it works well to aim to submit there, will keep all members cracking on :)  \r\n1. Elastic Ensemble: Jason with George Oastler (year 1 PhD). Some enhancements, Jason and George to submit paper to submit to DaWaK. \r\n2. TSF. Tony. Standard porting over. Giving myself three weeks for this.  \r\n3. RISE. Michael Flynn (year 2 PhD) and Tony. New version with both interval and sampling randomisation, probably not contracting. Michael to lead a paper to DaWaK.\r\n4. BOSS. Matthew Middlehurst (year 1 PhD), James Large (year 3 PhD) and Tony, with reference to the existing python implementation, but will go with our latest improved version. Matthew to lead a paper to DaWaK.\r\n5. Shapelets. David Guijo (year 2 PhD, intern from University of Cordoba) and Tony. Longer submission goal, with Romain at Rennes. Probable second internship over the summer. Aim for a journal paper end of the summer. \r\n\r\nPlease note this is all activity that is concurrent with the Turing project, and currently only informally aligned. I hope in time to get it all synchronised, but I think this is the most efficient way to progress on all fronts.  If anyone on the Turing project want to be involved we would be more than happy.

coming at this without too much context/familiarity etc on this side of the repo and obviously I'm no great authority, so I think I'll spell out the various requirements of e.g. a bakeoff style set of experiments as I see them, and then we'll meet somewhere in the middle with what everyone wants/is feasible/is worthwhile. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis turned into a bit of an essay, TL;DR: \r\n\r\n**1.1)** _Is the output of the results in the format that you expect to see?_ On a high level yes, but probability distributions would be wanted at minimum (for classification, sktime I recognise is for other tasks too), and more information in general is always good.\r\n**1.2)** _What post processing of the results is required?_ The individual results analysis methods already there look decent, all the standard stuff is there, and any more bespoke stuff can only really be defined in response to a need discovered with results to hand. (After writing:) Actually, pairwise win/draw/loss tables between classifiers can also be useful. And for e.g. average_and_std_error, being able to specify between mean and median (for e.g. average timings) can be useful too \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reproducing the output of the orchestrator, if we talked just in terms of accs: \r\n\r\n```\r\nViktor Saved Results              \r\nArrowHead        = 0.611428571\r\nGunPoint         = 0.906666667\r\nItalyPowerDemand = 0.951409135\r\n\r\nMaster Branch Notebook Output    \r\nArrowHead        = 0.906040\r\nGunPoint         = 0.951362\r\nItalyPowerDemand = 0.718391           \r\n\r\nMaster Branch Saved Results      \r\nArrowHead        = 0.72\r\nGunPoint         = 0.906666667\r\nItalyPowerDemand = 0.951409135   \r\n```\r\n\r\nDev branch failed, but I reckon now it's because I pulled dev but didn't reinstall it via pip in my env causing weird conflicts, can try again another time if needed\r\n\r\nSo broadly speaking on those results:\r\n**2.1)** My saved results vs victors: Gunpoint and IPD are same, ArrowHead is off. Probably difference in seed, but coincidentally same results on the other two dsets? Yeah, TSF's init has this default on master: random_state = None and random.seed(random_state). Dont know ins and outs of pythons/numpys random, but presumably that means unseeded. Prefer reproducibility even if seed not explicitly provided by user in my opinion, but that's a codebase-wide discussion/decision\r\n**2.2)** My saved results vs my notebook output: Looks like the accuracies ended up in the wrong rows on the notebook output (the numbers for each of these datasets look reasonable on the saved results), and are all slightly different regardless. The saved acc is computed in results_writing.py via 'from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score as acc', while for the notebook output it is computed in losses.py via ScoreAccuracy's calculate_per_dataset(self, y_true, y_pred). \r\n\r\n**On the file format:** \r\n\r\nThey have the same structure, but some things missing. It's an absolute pig of a class, but see the [ClassifierResults](https://github.com/uea-machine-learning/uea-tsc/blob/dev/src/main/java/evaluation/storage/ClassifierResults.java) class for info on the file structure we have over there (it has a bunch of over bloat in it too, but the file structure is the main thing). Depending on how closely everything wants to be mirrored between python/java (a decision above my pay grade atm), and how deep into the different aspects of performance measuring you guys want to do (timings etc), either mirror that as much as possible or even just switch over to a JSON format with equivalently named fields to be honest\r\n\r\nSpecifics: \r\n**3.1)** Probabilities should be retrievable/saved. Even if the classifier itself cannot produce probabilities, e.g. a 1 nearest neighbour, probs should be synthesised as a one-hot vector, 1 being at the pred class index. I recognise this is specific to the classification scenario. Is notionally the same file format intended to be used for regressing/forecasting results saving? Where e.g the same meta information is saved, just that for each different task (supervised/unsupervised classification/clustering/regression/forecasting) the information stored on each prediction differs \r\n**3.2)** Line1 meta/descriptive info. Most of this is hardly used for anything in reality aside from confirmation to the human experimenter/reader that this file represents the results they are hopefully expecting. The time unit (e.g. nanoseconds) is useful if expecting to read results that recorded times in different units, otherwise if you can always assume that everything is measured in e.g. nanoseconds then no real need. In the java version, if no timeunit is supplied then all timings (if any) in the file are assumed to be milliseconds, for example, because that's just the default unit we measured in. Not entirely required for a 'bakeoffredux'\r\n**3.3)** Line2 classifier info. In java, this is just left as a free space for the classifier to write any information about its state or the build/fit process, e.g. parameter settings or weightings or so on. Mainly useful if e.g. intending to post-process the settings of a tuned classifier from a saved parameters search (1 file per parameterset) or something like that. Or e.g. retrieving the weights computed of some process across datasets/folds for some piece of analysis in a paper. Not entirely required for a 'bakeoffredux'\r\n**3.4)** Line3 summaries/timings etc. For backwards compatibility and to give a human reader a summary of performance at a glance, the accuracy is stored here. As well as the build(fit) time, the test(predict) time, an optional benchmark operation timing for comparing times across hardware, memory(mostly goes unused), the number of classes (see *1), and more recently (and the jdoc was not updated properly for this yet...) train performance estimate method (e.g. cv_10) and time. How much of this you port across is up to how much is needed for future experiments and ultimately how much you have access too. Pretty much all of this is optional in the java version in terms of ability to read/write files, just obviously if some information is missing it limits what analyses you can do on the results later on. Our experiments class in java fills most of this in by default\r\n**3.5)** Prediction lines. We store trueClassVal, predClassVal, , prob[class0], ... prob[classC], , predTime, , predDescription(optional, mostly unused). I'd argue the true/predclass and probs should definitely be there. Individual prediction times would be difficult since in python you're typically predicting in batch mode and getting all of them at once from interfaced/imported classifiers that you might not want to mess with. Storing the total test time on line 3 should be fine though. The individual prediction times are mainly for particular applications/datasets with e.g. a streaming/real time prediction requirement, and so that we can look at variance in prediction times etc. Pred descriptions are entirely optional and up to the classifier/human reader to write/interpret. Intended usage was e.g. for an ensemble to output the predictions of each base classifier if desired for later analysis. \r\n\r\n*1 On number of classes and/or a class mapping, @jasonlines  and @TonyBagnall  you guys were talking about that before right, and having that as a requirement in general for things to line up between classifiers or something?\r\n\r\nIn general, a good rule of thumb I think is experiments are expensive time wise, but storage space is (hopefully) cheap. Writing out all the information you think you ever might need for whatever reason sounds good, which is why I also reckon just using json files is a perfectly valid option, you can add fields without ordering being important and naming each field doesn't matter too much in terms of the bytes used in storage. That being said, I've filled a couple TBs with results files by being over-zealous so there is obviously a limit depending on how much you're generating\r\n\r\nFor e.g. 20 classifiers, 128 datasets, 30 folds/resamples, and trainestimates generated, that’s 20*128*30*2 = 153600 files generated, size depends on number of instances and therefore amount of prediction info and how ‘neat’ the probabilities are in terms of double precision, 0.1 is obviously cheaper to store than 0.123423123… But suppose each file averages 10kb, that’s ~1.5gb, should be easily manageable. \r\n\r\n\r\n**On the orchestrator/experimental requirements**\r\n\r\nTypical way in which we'd define all the experiments for a bake-off style evaluation would be same as it is already in the orchestrator file i.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tfor each classifier/strategy\r\n\t\tfor each dataset\r\n\t\t\tfor train/test in each resample/fold\r\n\t\t\t\toptionally estimate performance on train set (through e.g. (nested) cv)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand write trainFoldX file\r\n\t\t\t\tbuild/fit on full train set\r\n\t\t\t\ttest/predict on test set\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand write testFoldX file\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe 'trainFoldX' files aren't strictly needed for a generic bake-off most likely and add A LOT to the total experimentation time if used e.g. 10 fold cv. They're useful when e.g. generating results for classifiers which will themselves be postprocessed to form ensembles etc. later on. Useful to have the option in general though, and all the tools are around\r\n\r\nHere, I'll call the 'orchestration' the for loops and other parameters of the set of experiments (e.g. data read/results write locations), which define a set of experiments to run, and a single 'experiment' as an evaluation of a particular classifier on a particular fold/resample of a dataset. \r\n\r\nWhen running sets of experiments locally they'd be run exactly like that, optionally with each experiment spawning a thread. For large-scale sets of experiments (e.g. bakeoff style), each individual experiment is run on separate cluster nodes. (Incidentally, we have our UEA cluster and code towards that, I don't know if you guys intend to allow options for e.g. hadoop clusters or whatever). If you want to emulate that for practicality, there's two main ways I'd argue to do that: \r\n\r\n**4.1)** The orchestrator is always initialised with and enumerates the full set of classifiers/datasets/folds, but if a particular experiment index (or list of indices?) is passed as an arg only that particular experiment is conducted/written on this run (makes sense with a higher-level orchestration class already in place, and works seamlessly with local experiments too)\r\n**4.2)** The user provides the particular experimental parameters to evaluate on each execution, which is typically how we've done it for a mix of historical(sunkcost)/uea-cluster reasons, e.g. we use a bash script to generate experiments (calls to an experiments jar with all the appropriate paras) to be completed on the cluster, where the bash script effectively acts as the orchestrator\r\n\r\n**On the post processed anaylsis** \r\n\r\nEither way at the end with saved results for all classifiers/datasets/folds, generate average scores and ranks (e.g. accuracy, AUC, log likelihood etc. for classification) for tables and statistical summaries/tests for e.g. critical difference diagrams, which the experiments.analysis file seems to have. A nice thing as well is to be able to easily slice down the results and repeat analysis on the reduced sets, e.g. get all datasets with 2 classes, and compare classifiers on those, etc. \r\n\r\nIndividual diagrams/extra tests to be desired etc. only really come about when you actually have the results and you want to show something with them of course. Probably leave deep-diving into that functionality for later and create as needed. Things like ROC diagrams are good for individual datasets if something particularly interesting is found, but in bake-off style stuff over many datasets that's not so important, etc. \r\n\r\nYeah, I've gone a bit ham on writing this up, but now take what you want from that I
