for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #729 by adding requested functionality.\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create a link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nThis is a draft pull request. \r\nI have implemented Croston's Method, by defining a function Croston() at sktime/forecasting/croston.py, which takes historical data as input and returns forecasted data in an array. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNope.\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nThis is my time contributing here, so the following would be helpful:\r\n- [ ] code readability\r\n- [ ] modularity\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
