Reference Issues\r\nAttempts to fix #1631.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nSpecific to prophet:\r\n\r\n* Set upper limit on pystan version\r\n* Moved from `fbprohet>=0.7.1` to `prophet>=1.0.0`.\r\n\r\nMore generally:\r\n\r\n* groups dependencies so it's clear when each dependency is used (mirrors #1620):\r\n  * `core dependencies` for the base sktime\r\n  * `all_extras` for extensions\r\n  * `dev` for contributors\r\n* Relaxed constraint on all libraries except `numpy` (see #1787 and #1794)\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nWe should test this across multiple OS and Python versions. I could test macOS with Python 3.8.12\r\n\r\n#### Other notice\r\n\r\nWhen `pip install -r build_tools/requirements.txt` is run, packages are collected; then **wheels are built**. When doing so, **`prophet` wheel fails to build because it is build before numpy is installed**. `pip` then installs the other dependencies and `prophet` too, but without building the wheel and using `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> Full log</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install -r build_tools/requirements.txt\r\nCollecting deprecated>=1.2.13\r\n  Using cached
