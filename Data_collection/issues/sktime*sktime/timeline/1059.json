In particular, having less explanation and having more tasks for the user to do (so they get sense of achievement and also so they are more likely to learn how to use it for themselves).\r\n\r\nOne thing I like about divio's framework overall is that it is clearer where to look for different kinds of documentation. If I want to learn the absolute basics of how to use sktime, I go to a tutorial. If I want to know how to do a specific task in sktime (e.g. create a pipeline), I go to how-to guides. If I want to look for explanations, I go to some kind of explanations section.\r\n\r\nNote, I do like the Forecasting and Classification tutorial notebooks, but I think they are better for 'explanations' rather than 'tutorials'.\r\n\r\n> Not sure what the alternative would look like though. Any good examples?\r\n\r\nGood question. I do not know examples. I can't say I have seen that many packages' documentation.\r\n\r\nLastly, I should say I am not strongly attached to divio's framework, but I think it is important we have some kind of framework, long-term plan and guiding principles.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/870011351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Lovkush-A","id":25344832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQ0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25344832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A","html_url":"https://github.com/Lovkush-A","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/870032431","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1059#issuecomment-870032431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1059","id":870032431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MDAzMjQzMQ==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T20:51:16Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T20:51:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">Divio provide what I think are convincing arguments in favour of a different style of tutorial: https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials/.
