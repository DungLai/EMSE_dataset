I see that you both skipped the docs tests in your PRs, which is also what `piecewise_normal` does, so not necessarily bad! (although I actually forget why we skip the docs test there, perhaps @lmmentel can remind me?).  To see an example that doesn't skip the docs tests can check out the `piecewise_normal_multivariate` instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1374539696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8175046899,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5QwPklzwAAAAHnRVDz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8175046899","actor":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-07T16:59:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8175046903,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5QwPklzwAAAAHnRVD3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8175046903","actor":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-07T16:59:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1374595317","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3363#issuecomment-1374595317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3363","id":1374595317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5R7qj1","user":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-07T20:06:40Z","updated_at":"2023-01-07T20:06:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for picking up the work @JonathanBechtel and @Pyyim!
