Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this PR I added `TEST_FHS_TIMEDELTA` test cases to  `sktime.forecasting.base.tests.test_fh.test_fh`. In order to pass the tests two changes were required in `ForecastingHorizon` itself: in `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon._is_in_sample` and in `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon._is_out_of_sample`. Both methods perform comparison with zero which in case of `pd.Timdelta` values should actually be `pd.Timedelta(0)`.\r\n\r\nNote that `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon.to_indexer` returns `None` in the new timedelta case. I have no idea what this method should return in this case. Any suggestions are very much welcome.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have silenced the pre-commit error from (described here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2338) by using `# noqa: B019` next to the `@lru_cache` decorator.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass

If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [DOC] or [BUG] indicating wether the PR topic is related to enhancement, documentation or
