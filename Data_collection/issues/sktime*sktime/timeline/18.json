I: informal description of (sup.) forecasting tasks\r\n\r\nBased on the paper I'm writing with Ahmed, I've thought about the task and model structure for (supervised) forecasting. I think it makes sense to split these in three aspects which I describe below.\r\n\r\nAll tasks revolve around making predictions of observations at future time points, but how this is to be done varies.\r\n\r\n(1) supervised vs not. In *supervised* forecasting, there are i.i.d. training examples of the same situation. In (narrow sense) forecasting, there are no training examples, only a single (potentially multivariate) time series. In the supervised setting, independent examples are expected in rows of the data frame. Columns may contain named univariate or multivariate series, or primitive data.\r\n\r\n(2) fixed or moving observation horizon (\"cut-off\"). When predicting the values for time points t'_1,... t'_k, may only observations up to time T be used - irrespective of t'_i? -> fixed cut-off.\r\nOr, to predict the value at t'_i, may observations up to time t'_i - h be used, for fixed h? Including t'_j where t'_j < t'_i -j? -> moving cut-off\r\n\r\n(3) Functional vs concrete forecasting horizon.\r\nDo we already know at time of prediction which (finite number of) time points the prediction is for?\r\nIf yes, this is \"concrete\" forecasting and the task is to produce forecasts to known time points.\r\nIf no, then forecasting is \"functional\", and the prediction output is a function or algorithm, which given a (possiblyl later known) time point produces the value. \r\nIn the \"functional\" case, a time point range for the functional forcasts needs be provided when fitting.\r\nIn the \"concrete\" case, the finite set of time points to forecast for (absolute, or relative to cut-off) needs to be specified when fitting.\r\n\r\nOther related time series tasks that this will not cover, for now:\r\n- time series segmentation - label parts of the time series, supervised or semi-supervised. \r\n- interpolation - given later and earlier time points, predict something in the middle\r\n- nowcasting - predict one missing time series given others that are observed at the same time\r\nDifferent tasks, needs different interface, i.m.o., and might complicate things too much in 1st instance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/466815475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/466817797","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/18#issuecomment-466817797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/18","id":466817797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjgxNzc5Nw==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-24T21:15:10Z","updated_at":"2019-02-24T21:49:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Part II: tasks\r\n\r\ntasks are a classes with parameters/attributes and utility methods\r\n(essentially descriptors)\r\n\r\nParameters - private variables.

are some ideas for the forecasting `task` object thanks to @sajaysurya. The main intuition was to keep it as simple as possible and similar to the TSC task interface, possibly allowing us to have a single task class rather than one for each use case. Going through @fkiraly's design above: \r\n\r\n> supervised - boolean (corresponds to (1) above)\r\n\r\nmay not be necessary, as it's identifiable from data/metadata (one or multiple rows)\r\n \r\n> predictfrom - list of names of covariates/inputs/features (columns) to predict from\r\n> (in prediction, features are used only until observation cut-off)\r\n\r\nis identical to features in TSC task\r\n\r\n> predicttargets - list of names of targets/outputs/labels (columns) to predict\r\n\r\nis identical to target in TSC task\r\n\r\n> usetargettoforecast - boolean. If \"false\", for forecasting, methods may not access the target time series, even if observations lie in the past. If \"true\" (default), the targets are used for forecasting and visible to the forecaster method.\r\n\r\nnot necessary as a separate argument, target column could simply be both in features and target\r\n\r\n> obshorizon - dictionary with following fields\r\n> obshorizon.type - one of \"single\" (default), \"moving\", \"custom\"\r\n\r\nFor classical forecasting, obshorizon could be handled with a time series splitter (similar to train_test_split, but for time indices), which supports fixed and moving splits and which accepts one or multiple fixed cut-off points or instructions for a moving cut-off point, possibly refactoring the sklearn's [TimeSeriesSplitter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) \r\n\r\nFor the supervised forecasting case, the splitter would be a 2-dimensional splitter, splitting both temporally and across iid samples, e.g. \r\n\r\n`(train_rows, train_times), (test_rows, test_times) = SupForecastCrossValidator().split()`\r\n\r\nFor predictions at multiple cut-off points, the `orchestrator` could be used to automatically take care of the splitting, fitting and predicting. \r\n\r\n> predhorizon - dictionary with following fields\r\n> predhorizon.type - one of \"concrete\" (default), \"functional\"\r\n> predhorizon.anchor - one of \"relative\" (default), \"absolute\"\r\n\r\npredhorizon has to be in task but could for example be passed together with target as a tuple to the task, i.e. `target=(target_name, predhorizon)`, rather than a separate argument.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/478244535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2241027435,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTAyNzQzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2241027435","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T13:13:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241027436,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNDEwMjc0MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2241027436","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T13:13:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241027437,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTAyNzQzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2241027437","actor":{"login":"sajaysurya","id":25329624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzI5NjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25329624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya","html_url":"https://github.com/sajaysurya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T13:13:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241027438,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNDEwMjc0Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2241027438","actor":{"login":"sajaysurya","id":25329624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzI5NjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25329
