invoked\r\n\r\nFurther bugs in the metrics base classes were discovered in the process of fixing:\r\n\r\n* the `BaseForecastingMetric` did not call `super.__init__` in its `__init__`, breaking dynamic tag functionality\r\n* the `BaseForecastingMetric` would overwrite `self.name` even if it was set by a child class already, leading to potential `sklearn` incompatibility (parameter get/set)\r\n\r\nThe bug was also not caught since the dynamic metric started with an underscore, so was not collected in tests.\r\nThis has been remedied by adding to tests:\r\n\r\n* a version of the example in #3221\r\n* the custom metric from #3221 as test parameters for the dynamic metric\r\n* a full run of `check_estimator` on the resulting
