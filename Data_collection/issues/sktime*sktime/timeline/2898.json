I've just opened a PR to cmdstanpy which should fix this issue and tests the pickling of cmdstanpy objects going forward. Once it has passing tests and approval I plan to release a 1.0.3 just to address this.\r\n\r\nI should note that cmdstanpy _cannot_ support _full_ pickling - certain operations like `.summary()` rely on the existence of files on disk which are outside the control of the pickling process. But, it seems like the most common operations, such as accessing the draws of the fit, do pickle fine, which is presumably all Prophet cares about in the end.
