with #2304, all currently interfaced statsmodels models have the full parameter set.\r\n\r\nDetails from #2304, citing @biologioholic there:\r\n\r\nThere is no more parameters missing for statsmodel interface.  I realize it's been a lengthy first PR. Really appreciate the patience and input of everyone involved (Next time I'll make a draft PR first 😄). Below is a summary of what happened:\r\n\r\nFive statsmodel-based files were reviewed/worked on. These are:\r\n\r\n1. var.py - added `freq`, `dates` and `ic` parameters. Added default values for other parameters already in place.\r\n2. trend.py - no change, no missing parameters.\r\n3. theta.py - no change, no missing parameters.\r\n4. structural.py - ~~added `approximate_diffuse_variance`~~ This parameter belongs to method `initialize_default` - this is supposed to be a private method and not part of fit or constructor. Thus, no missing parameters.\r\n5. ets.py - ~~added `method`, `skip_hessian`, `approx_centered`, `approxe_complex_step`, `return_raw`~~ - These parameters are part of the super class and not exposed to users. Thus, these are not included.
