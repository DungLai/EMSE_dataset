wind direction based on these vectors and input this into the forecaster.\r\n    + Calculate the wind speed and input this into the forecaster.\r\n    + Also take the wind speed and calculate the cube of this value and input this into the forecaster.\r\n+ The historical wind power should be used to select appropriate lag variables for the forecaster.\r\n+ Calendar features (hour, month)\r\n       + should be extracted.\r\n       + be encoded (sinus and cosinus) and inputed into the forecaster.\r\n\r\n**Here is a possible example pipeline**\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UGa9e7O.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Open Points\r\n+ Perhaps include anomaly detection and outlier handling.\r\n+ Include missing value handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1192472970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"benHeid","id":9725296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjUyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9725296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid","html_url":"https://github.com/benHeid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7045783665,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5N1t8uzwAAAAGj9iBx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7045783665","actor":{"login":"kalebphipps","id":58810809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODEwODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58810809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps","html_url":"https://github.com/kalebphipps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T11:25:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7045783672,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5N1t8uzwAAAAGj9iB4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7045783672","actor":{"login":"kalebphipps","id":58810809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODEwODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58810809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps","html_url":"https://github.com/kalebphipps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalebphipps/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T11:25:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1192504965","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3023#issuecomment-1192504965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3023","id":1192504965,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HFC6F","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T12:06:55Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T12:06:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Example

Electrical demand forecasting with different forecasting horizons\r\n\r\nExample from the discussion on August 15th ([hackmd](https://hackmd.io/sBktzRZAQhixXaRuOoFt5A))\r\n\r\n@benHeid: \"Imagine you want to predict a electrical demand of an household with an horizon of two weeks. The consumption the next hour is often similar to the current demand. However, the demand for the next week is really hard to forecast. In that case, you probably would take some average values grouped by the weekday. In this use-case, you would have multiple forecasters with different forecasting horizons. I.e., even if it is a final step, I can imagine scenarios where a pipeline contains forecasters with different forecasting horizons.\"\r\n\r\n@miraep8: \"think Benedikt’s example is a very useful one! I suppose the user can try to access some of these things via dots (ie something similar is done in the GridSearchCV - eg step.__parameter__). It also begs the question of - if you have multiple forecasting horisons how would that work with SlidingWindowCV or similar…\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1228509270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SMEISEN","id":33990691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTkwNjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33990691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN","html_url":"https://github.com/SMEISEN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SMEISEN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7267798280,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5N1t8uzwAAAAGxMc0I","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7267798280","actor":{"login":"benHeid","id":9725296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjUyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9725296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid","html_url":"https://github.com/benHeid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-26T13:44:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7267798288,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5N1t8uzwAAAAGxMc0Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7267798288","actor":{"login":"benHeid","id":9725296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjUyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9725296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid","html_url":"https://github.com/benHeid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-26T13:44:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7267798299,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5N1t8uzwAAAAGxMc0b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7267798299","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-26T13:44:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7267798308,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5N1t8uzwAAAAGxMc0k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7267798308","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8",
