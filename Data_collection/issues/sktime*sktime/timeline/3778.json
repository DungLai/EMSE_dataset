challenges than mentioned so far;   \r\n  -  frequency information is removed after TempAgg transform\r\n      If I retain the information, the reconciler forecaster fails due to an internal check on frequencies.\r\n     This is mitigated by recreating the indices in the inverse transform\r\n  * Prediction is a bit weird due to this. You could argue that `predict([1,2])` gives a forecast for 14 days, i.e. two weeks.\r\n  * The temporal aggregator now removes incomplete weeks, via a filter.\r\n     It uses the days already known from the sales data in the final forecast in the inverse transform.\r\n  * In the actual problem, I also have to account for closings. The shop is closed on some days and there are no sales.\r\n    I aim to solve this by adding another transformer at the very end, which again does a disaggregation.\r\n    Let me know if you have
