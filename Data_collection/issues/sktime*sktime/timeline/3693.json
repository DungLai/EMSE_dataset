have been involved in implementing a conformal interval wrapper based on this method in [sktime](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/conformal.py). \r\n\r\nI am confused about how the Bonferroni correction works  and wondered if you could help. There are more details in [this issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3693) and [this PR](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3701) but essentially I _think_ the implementation is as in the paper but the results when `alpha=0.5` are unintuitive (the values get much larger and it throws the forecasts off). \r\n\r\nWe don't use the factor of `(n_calibration + 1.0)/n_calibration` as you do in this code but that is close to 1 so I don't think it would make the difference. Do you have any pointers to what could be going wrong here?\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kamilest/conformal-rnn/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kamilest/conformal-rnn/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
