Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nCloses #1750\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nProhibit the use of `pd.Timestamp` type for `cutoff` in `ForecastingHorizon`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis solves the problem of extracting frequency from an object that will not have this property in some future (see this comment https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15146#issuecomment-273266806 and the whole deprecation PR for details). Although the problem is solved, the solution itself is far from being ideal. The major negative consequence is the mismatch in types between a time series index, which is normally `pd.DatetimeIndex`, and the absolute forecasting horizon of `pd.PeriodIndex` obtained given `pd.Period` cutoff. This happens when the cutoff is taken to be one of the `y.index` (`pd.DatetimeIndex`) elements, which is `pd.Timestamp`. This is not allowed, so we have to convert the cutoff to `pd.Period`. The result of `fh.to_absolute(cutoff).to_pandas()` is then a `pd.PeriodIndex`.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this conversion should happen under the hood, without a user noticing it. But it seems impossible without major refactoring. In particular, `ForecastingHorizon` is not aware of the time series itself and its frequency. So it has to obtain the frequency somehow. In the current implementation it is only `cutoff`. An alternative to consider would be to pass frequency explicitly as an argument to `ForecastingHorizon`.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nThis is very controversial and touches the very core of the library, so I hope for a very careful consideration of this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
