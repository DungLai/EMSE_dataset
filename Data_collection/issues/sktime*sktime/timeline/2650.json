Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nFixes #2650. See also #1694\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThis transformer is applied on the time index to generate Fourier series features as described here -> https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/\r\n\r\nWhen fit is called the minimum date of X is stored. This date serves as the reference point for the time-steps passed, t.\r\nSo in the transform step, t is going to be the difference between the minimum date of X passed on fit (based on the frequency of the period index). \r\n\r\nThis behaviour is checked in the test `sktime.transformers.series.tests.test_fourier.test_fit_transform_behaviour`\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n- [ ] input checks are happening on the right place\r\n- [ ] fit and transform behaviour is the expected one. \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
