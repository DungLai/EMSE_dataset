could you describe what behaviour you expected when calling update? \r\n\r\nUpdate can mean several things: \r\n1. passing \"now\" information, i.e. the cutoff at which we want to make predictions,\r\n2. passing new data,\r\n3. updating fitted parameters based on new data. \r\n\r\nIf you just want 1 and 2, you should be able to call `update(..., update_params=False)`.\r\n\r\nIf you also want 3, you need to call `update(..., update_params=True)`. This is the new default setting for `update_params`, as we thought that this is intuitively what most users will expect what `update` means, similar to `partial_fit` in scikit-learn. \r\n\r\nUpdating parameters like fitting parameters requires a separate model-specific algorithm, none of them are implemented at the moment. The default behaviour is therefore to fall back to refitting, which can still be seen as a form of updating, but may not be as efficient as bespoke update algorithms. We raise the warning to let users know that this is what's happening.\r\n\r\nAre you aware of any toolbox that implements online-learning/update algorithms for common forecasting models? I'm not aware of many libraries that do that, e.g. statsmodels does not seem to support this (see this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66345248/partial-fit-or-incremental-learning-for-autoregressive-model#comment117297808_66345248)). \r\n\r\nMore details can be found [here](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/01_forecasting_api/model-evaluation-tuning.md). Sorry for the unexpected change - a few things are not consolidated yet, especially in the forecasting module. \r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/releases/tag/v0.6.0\r\n\r\nAre you able to share the code you use to generate bootstrap prediction intervals? Implementing this as part of sktime would be nice.
