If you want to use them in some weird non standard way for forecasting, go for it, maybe there is even a python history of it, I dont know. However, we want to use them in a the purely defined sense as we see it. I dont know why you are persistently blocking such a simple, uncontroversial change for classifiers when ABC is already used in benchmarking (which you managed), and why you did not object to its use in clustering and distances. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1022015768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1022752520","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1923#issuecomment-1022752520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923","id":1022752520,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc489fcI","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-27T01:13:26Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T01:26:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@chrisholder \r\n\r\n>> which classes would inherit from ABCMeta?\r\n\r\n> BaseClusterer, BaseClassifier, BaseForecaster etc. Essentially any estimator/transformer that current uses raise NotImplementedError().

If so, what is the argument to be certain?\r\n\r\n>>what about polymorphic estimators, e.g., a pipeline that can act like a transformer or a forecaster? \r\n\r\n>We shouldn't be not using the best practise stuff where it's appropriate just because a niche scenario it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nVery shaky argument imo. Polymorphic pipelines are not niche, the pipeline is in fact a central object in `sklearn`-like libraries. I am against abc unless we can ensure that polymorphic pipelines such as the `sklearn` one work properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1022752520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1022754510","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1923#issuecomment-1022754510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923","id":1022754510,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc489f7O","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-27T01:17:27Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T01:27:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@TonyBagnall \r\n\r\n> I think you have misunderstood the meaning of abstract methods, or at least the meaning we teach our first years. \r\n\r\nI know what abstract methods are and how they work in abc.\r\nA descendant will exception if it doesn't override all the abstracts declared by abc.\r\n\r\n>> which classes would inherit from ABCMeta?\r\n\r\n>ones with abstract methods currently raising errors if not implemented\r\n\r\nWhy not `BaseObject`?

actions for the 0.15.0 release:\r\n\r\n* changed `check_is_scitype` parameter `msg_legacy_interface` to `False`\r\n* `ExpandingWindowSplitter` had `start_with_window` argument removed. From now on, `initial_window=0` should be used instead of `start_with_window=False`. Contains bugfix https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3953 as the deprecation logic was incomplete.\r\n* Test `test_methods_do_not_change_state` renamed to `test_non_state_changing_method_contract`\r\n* row transformers have been removed, replaced by base class vectorization/broadcasting\r\n* changed default for `default_fc_parameters` in `tsfresh` transformers to follow the default of `tsfresh`, which currently is `comprehensive`\r\n* removed module `transformations.series.compose`. All contents were moved to `transformations.compose`.\r\n\r\nDelayed to 0.16.0:\r\n* base class of `ProbabilityThresholdEarlyClassifier` change to `BaseEarlyClassifier`. Unclear what to do here, deprecation action specified breaks the interface compliance tests.
