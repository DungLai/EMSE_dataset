Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #3009 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis adds the base class `_predict_quantiles` method into `conformal.py` to ensure that the `_predict_quantiles` method for the forecaster that is wrapped with `conformal.py` is consistent with `_predict_interval`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nI have just copied and pasted the base class `_predict_quantiles` method and removed the `implements_interval` check .
