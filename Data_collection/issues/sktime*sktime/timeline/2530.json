... <1000 instead of >20000?? 👀 👀 👀 👁️‍👁️‍\r\n\r\nI put my testing commits to this table. I've been triggering the runs and writing the table by hand, so sometimes the durations and links are not apples to apples comparisons.  However as you can see this is great. \r\nMore random thoughts: \r\n* I might have been lucky, with the commits I picked, it's not a big sample size. However it's quite time consuming to do this so I would like to have your decision about --pyargs, before investing more time into this.\r\n* `python -m pytest sktime/` picks **20633** tests vs **20212** picked by `pytest --pyargs sktime`. (I'm sure this could be fixed in pytest conf to match perfectly)\r\n* creating virtualenv takes 3 minutes. I used https://github.com/marketplace/actions/restore-or-create-a-python-virtualenv \r\n* execution of 0 or 1 test takes ~ 3 minutes. As far as I know this is not overhead of testmon but initialization of sktime. \r\n* there is huge amount of warnings which makes it quite annoying to work with the logs.\r\n\r\nWatch out, the table is probably wider then you see.\r\n\r\n| testmon                                                                                                                                              |

this looks nice!\r\n\r\nHere's a question: could you kindly explain the logic picking the tests in the following simplified case?\r\n\r\n* there is a function `get_all_classes` that picks up all classes in `sktime` and feeds them to three tests via `pytest_generate_tests`, let's say `test1`, `test2`, `test3`, depending on properties of the class (let's say attributes `needs_test1`, `needs_test2`, `needs_test3`)\r\n* in PR no.1, we add one new class somewhere in `sktime`\r\n* in PR no.2, we change the `needs_test2` attribute to `True` from `False` in some existing class\r\n\r\nBased on the \"lines affected\" logic (which I think is behind `testmon`?), why would this pick the right tests, i.e., in PR no.1 whichever tests the attributes require (optimally only on the new class), and in test no.2, exactly `test2` (optimally, only on the changed class)?\r\n\r\n(this is simplified from how the `sktime` test suite actually works, there is no `get_all_classes`, but there is `all_estimators` which is used inside `BaseFixtureGenerator.pytest_generate_tests` via

:)\r\n> \r\n> I´m not sure - could you give a few lines of why this would be missed?\r\n\r\ntestmon considers only lines executed during the test execution as dependencies. Lines which are executed at import time (before test execution) are only considered a dependency in some cases and the case described is not one of them. I already have a couple of ideas how to approach fixing this, but it's not easy and without runtime cost.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Long initialization is due to fixture collection - any ideas how to address that?\r\n\r\npytest doesn't create fixtures for deselected tests. Are the many different classes initialized during pytest_generate_tests by chance? Would it be possible to postpone that to test setup? Maybe there is not low hanging fruit :/\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Warnings are mostly deprecation related, is that correct?\r\n\r\nIt seems so. If not fixing, then maybe supressing warnings would be OK?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1107920732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tarpas","id":135344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas","html_url":"https://github.com/tarpas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1117460984","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2530#issuecomment-1117460984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2530","id":1117460984,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Cmxn4","user":{"login":"tarpas","id":135344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas","html_url":"https://github.com/tarpas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarpas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T15:12:32Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T15:12:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To
