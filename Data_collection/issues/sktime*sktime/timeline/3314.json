Apologies.\r\n\r\n@GigaMoksh thanks for considering taking this up. I looked around and found the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nThese HTML files are made automatically via `sphinx`. I encourage you to look into the `/docs` directory and read more about how documentation in `sktime` is structured. [Here's](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/developer_guide/documentation.html) a developer guide for documentation prescribed to contributors. If you have any further doubts (eg: need further resources), you could visit slack / discord and ask on the relevant channel(s).\r\n\r\nYou can try to solve it on your own if you want to, but here's the problem and solution:\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nIn `docs/source/api_reference/classification.rst`, relevant lines for the `deep_learning` submodule are missing. This is why `autosummary` directive is failing to produce files for any estimator under this submodule. \r\n\r\nThe solution is simple, add the missing lines and one could take other submodules as reference. As an additional step, one could also try if find if any other submodules are missing in any other `.rst` files.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nHappy
