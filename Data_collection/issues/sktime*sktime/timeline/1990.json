test class based design in #1987.\r\nThis PR requires and is conditional on #1987, all changes to `test_all_estimators` should be reviewed in #1987.\r\n\r\nBesides the refactor, the conditional fixture generation plug-in is used to remove the dozen times repeated boilerplate code to obtain the `n_columns` variable, this is now a conditional fixture instead.\r\n\r\nNo further refactoring is carried out, although there would be some opportunity based on this (e.g., using scenarios or moving to `test_all_estimators`). Ideas for further refactoring along natural lines are left in the code as todo

This occurs when the forecasting horizon starts in sample, as the window length is the full length of the data but there is not enough historical data to fill the window so I have added NA's in this case. There is precedent for this as NAs are added to satisfy a window length in the case that the window length isn't a multiple of `sp`. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nDoes this fix work theoretically.
