Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #1593 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nWhen re-fitting (as opposed to updating) forecasting models self._y will be updated to the latest training data used.\r\nThis fix adds an additional check in update_y_X. If the forecaster is fitted it means that this is an update call (in fit the first line of code should be self._is_fitted = False). If it's fitted we use the combine first, if it's not fitted we overwrite _y with y. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n- [x] Does combine_first have a different purpose that this fix will break (maybe when update is used).   (It does) \r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/967145661","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1593#issuecomment-967145661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1593","id":967145661,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc45pXi9","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-12T14:10:27Z","updated_at":"2021-11-12T14:10:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yes, this is indeed a problem.
