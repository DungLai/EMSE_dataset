@mloning,  @fkiraly,\r\nI'm new to contributing, and I was paying attention to this issue for some time.

T must be the length of the training dataset, right?\r\n   2. Is the number of parameters estimated in the forecasting method(K) is 1 for this issue?\r\n\r\n- Other than that, everything is clear according to the [document](https://otexts.com/fpp3/prediction-intervals.html).\r\n- I looked at the [NaiveForecaster](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/sktime/forecasting/naive.py), and I want to know that, what is the best way to return the prediction intervals,\r\n   1. From a separate function inside the [NaiveForecaster](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/sktime/forecasting/naive.py)?\r\n   2. Or from the **predict** function under [_sktime.py](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/15c5ccba8999ddfc52fe37fe4d6a7ff39a19ece3/sktime/forecasting/base/_sktime.py#L206)?\r\n   3. Is there any other forecasting method in Sktime that the prediction interval already exists to use as an example?\r\n   4. Or is there any other approach that you would like to suggest?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/796462701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"D3ViL-NK","id":43887812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODg3ODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43887812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK","html_url":"https://github.com/D3ViL-NK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D3ViL-NK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4441703356,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ0MTcwMzM1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4441703356","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-11T05:20:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4441703362,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NDE3MDMzNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4441703362","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-11T05:20:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4441738356,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ0MTczODM1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4441738356","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-11T05:27:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4441738362,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NDE3MzgzNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4441738362","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","u
