* How do we deal with an algorithm refusing to make a prediction? Both in the sense of what would we actually return (`None` seems reasonable) and how would we go about testing, as returning this is likely to break some of the standard classifier ones.\r\n\r\nI guess, there are two ways to address this:\r\n\r\n1. Return None\r\n2. Return the predicted class label and a second method indicates if the prediction is safe, i.e. the confidence is high enough\r\n\r\nUsing the latter would not break other APIs, but it might be counter-intuitive to use a second method\r\n\r\n> * How do we verify input when predicting? Some algorithms can only make decisions at specific series lengths (commonly in 5% intervals), do any additions need to be made for this, or should it be left to the individual algorithm?\r\n\r\nI would say, it is up to the algorithm to use the corresponding classifier. \r\n\r\n> * Some algorithms keep data from previous prediction attempts, i.e. a decision at 15% of the series may use information from the decisions at 5% and 10%. Do we require any additional predict inputs to accommodate this? How do we reset for new data when predicting?\r\n\r\nInteresting question! :)  I would rather say, one should keep the classifier state-less. \r\n\r\nThereby, the predict method might\r\n\r\n1. Either return some state-object\r\n2. Recompute everything from start\r\n\r\n\r\n> * Do we require an extended base class for any of this? Would having it anyway help with testing, or would it be better as a tag?\r\n> \r\n> Good first implementations would be [TEASER](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-020-00690-z) and a simple probability threshold for making the decision.\r\n\r\nI do have a very simple port to python as a jupyter notebook, ignoring the issues mentioned above. However, I did not get the performance any close to the one from Java.
