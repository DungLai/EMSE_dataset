I think this is expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen applying a transformer that cannot deal with panel/hierarchical data (such as `FeatureSelection`) to panel/hierarchical data (`X`, as in the example), it fits one model per instance node.\r\n\r\nThose models can be accessed in the `transformers_` attribute (formatted as `pd.DataFrame`), each of them has feature importances:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datatypes import get_examples\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.feature_selection import FeatureSelection\r\n\r\nX = get_examples(\"pd-multiindex\")[0]\r\ny = get_examples(\"pd-multiindex\")[1]\r\n\r\ntransformer = FeatureSelection(method=\"feature-importances\", n_columns = 20)\r\ntransformer.fit(X, y)\r\ntransformer.transformers_\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n                             transformers\r\ninstances                                \r\n0          FeatureSelection(n_columns=20)\r\n1          FeatureSelection(n_columns=20)\r\n2          FeatureSelection(n_columns=20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo access the feature importance, select the transformer you want and access its attributes, e.g.,\r\n```python\r\ntransformer.transformers_.iloc[0, 0].feature_importances_\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, one could argue whether the `FeatureSelection` transformer *should* be doing this or something else, i.e., have native functionality for hierarchical data or not.\r\nBut that's a different topic, and not a bug as far as I see.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1175162979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6935243829,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5NJYr2zwAAAAGdX2w1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6935243829","actor":{"login":"CelieDs","id":66422896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDIyODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66422896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs","html_url":"https://github.com/CelieDs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-05T14:59:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6935243839,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5NJYr2zwAAAAGdX2w_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6935243839","actor":{"login":"CelieDs","id":66422896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDIyODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66422896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs","html_url":"https://github.com/CelieDs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CelieDs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-05T14:59:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6935254472,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5NJYr2zwAAAAGdX5XI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6935254472","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-05T15:00:57Z","project_card":{"id":83878180,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/83878180","project_id":5198515,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/5198515","column_name":"Fixed/resolved","previous_column_name":"Reproduced/confirmed"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7520405063,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc5NJYr2zwAAAAHAQEZH","url":"https://ap
