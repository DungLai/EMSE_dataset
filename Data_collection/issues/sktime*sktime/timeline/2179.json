attempted fix for #1662 which PR #1665, #1701 did not fix. Hopefully the definitive fix now.\r\n\r\nThis fix completely rewrites the `FeatureUnion` instead of inheriting from the `sklearn` one.\r\nWith the new transformers refactor, we can simply use `pandas` functionality to merge/concatenate data frames internally, while the framework does the rest.\r\n\r\nMinor complication:\r\nWith the transformer refactor, the \"row-wise transformer\" have become obsolete, since vectorization (to panel) is performed automatically whenever such a data container is encountered.\r\nSome tests not directly related to the `FeatureUnion` but also using `FeatureUnion` were still using them, so I `xfailed` them for the time being, until the `RowTransformer`s are entirely removed, see issue

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2179\r\n\r\nThis PR deprecates the row transformers, i.e., `SeriesToSeriesRowTransformers` and `SeriesToPanelRowTransformers`.\r\n\r\nThe original reason to have these was to allow application of series transformers to panel data. This is functionality which is now integrated into the base class, i.e., `fit` and `transform` automatically vectorize (see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2219).\r\n\r\nFor the deprecation period, `make_row_transformer` will return the transformer passed to it (since it already has the functionality it was meant to attach), and the row transformers will simply patch through all transformer methods.\r\n\r\nRelies on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3087 to ensure panel compatibility of `sklearn` `FunctionTransformer`, by closing the gap between \"stateless\" scopes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2370/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6357148402,"node_id":"COE_lADOCVKAsc5FS2J8zwAAAAF66mLy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6357148402","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-02T16:40:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7245238472,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5FS2J8zwAAAAGv2ZDI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7245238472","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-23T20:14:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7245238528,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5FS2J8zwAAAAGv2ZEA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7245238528","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"197d48265dbbf1a661a9acc5c3a6ad61c5af9330","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/197d48265dbbf1a661a9acc5c3a6ad61c5af9330","created_at":"2022-08-23T20:14:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
