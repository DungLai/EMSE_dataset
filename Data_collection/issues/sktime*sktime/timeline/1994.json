Solution to issue cannot be found in the documentation.\n\n- [X] I checked the documentation.\n\n### Issue\n\nHi, dear maintainers.\r\n\r\n`sktime` is a fairly good project to deal with time series problems. It is used in my project [HyperTS](https://github.com/DataCanvasIO/HyperTS), and an error is reported in the process of publishing my package to CONDA forge by executing command `pip check`: \r\n```\r\nsktime 0.10.1 has requirement numpy<1.22,>=1.21.0, but you have numpy 1.22.3.\r\nsktime 0.10.1 has requirement scipy<1.8.0, but you have scipy 1.8.0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed that `sktime==0.10.1` limited the upper bound of numpy and scipy:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/b6c7153b4b0fbe601ab2308c53a408f07bc435b2/pyproject.toml#L48-L52\r\n\r\nThis may conflict with other packages, I used command `pip-compile` to check the dependencies of my project as follows:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nscipy==1.7.3\r\n    # via\r\n    #   featuretools\r\n    #   hypernets\r\n    #   lightgbm\r\n    #   scikit-learn\r\n    #   seaborn\r\n    #   sktime\r\n    #   statsmodels\r\nnumpy==1.22.3\r\n    # via\r\n    #   -r ./requirements.txt\r\n    #   cmdstanpy\r\n    #   dask\r\n    #   featuretools\r\n    #   hypernets\r\n    #   lightgbm\r\n    #   matplotlib\r\n    #   numba\r\n    #   pandas\r\n    #   patsy\r\n    #   prophet\r\n    #   pyarrow\r\n    #   pystan\r\n    #   scikit-learn\r\n    #   scipy\r\n    #   seaborn\r\n    #   sktime\r\n    #   statsmodels\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt shows that many packages depend on `numpy` and `scipy`, can it be compatible with more numpy and scipy versions to  better coexist with other packages?  Or is there any special reason to use `numpy<1.23` and `scipy<1.8` ? I mean, removing the upper bound of the version makes the dependency look like:\r\n```\r\nnumpy>=1.21.0\r\nscipy>x.x.x\r\n```\r\nIs this feasible? Look forward to your reply\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n-
