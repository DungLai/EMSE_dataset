me answer what I can:\r\n\r\n> Secondly, I understand that unequal time series is probably a more difficult usecase so I was wondering if I might not just try and pad the different time series using forward fills to get the more common equal time series use case. That might increase the options I have available for my use case. Since this is all quite new to me, I was thinking of using different transformations (PAA/SAX/Catch22, Matrix profile etc) and then find a way to featurize these for a couple of different pipeline setups: sklearn type as well as the sktime multivariate pipelines from the examples.\r\n\r\nPipelines like this are definitely a priority focus. To which extent they are already possible with the various components we have in 0.10.0, @TonyBagnall can answer.\r\n\r\nI suspect you my already be able to do this by pipelining the `PaddingTransformer` or `TruncationTranformer` with a multivariate classifier.\r\n\r\n> Apologies but I have a follow up question as well regarding the unequal time series example. Imagine a dataset with n instances, t timepoints and d dimensions. Do we need to have equal time points per dimension or equal timepoints ACROSS dimensions?\r\n\r\nThe `sktime` interface does *not* enforce equal time points per dimension or across dimensions - as long as you use a data format such as `pd-multiindex` that doesn't. The `numpy3D` format does.\r\nSee this tutorial for data formats: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/AA_datatypes_and_datasets.ipynb\r\n\r\nHowever, individual time series classifiers may enforce equal time index (and in fact most do, I think), since the logic/mathematics assumes that. The corresponding classifier tag is `\"capability:unequal_length\"` for unequal length time series. There is no tag for \"time index must be equal across series\", I just notice - do you know why, @TonyBagnall?\r\n\r\nYou can search classifiers via the `registry.all_estimators`, or in the estimator
