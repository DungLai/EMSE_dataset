Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nImplement an adapter to convert multiindex format to ListDataset in gluon-ts\r\nThe method takes as input a pd-multiindex DataFrame, (optional) a list of categorical feature, (optional) the startdate and (optional) frequency of the dataset. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nDependency: gluon-ts\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nTesting with different dataset in sktime to weed out the bugs. So far, Arrowhead, ItalyPoowerDemand and [StandWalkJump](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php) have been tested.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are.

the benchmarking meeting today, a number of topics was discussed regarding benchmarking. This issue summarizes/expands these discussions. This documents will be updated after meetings:\r\nThree packages were among the discussions on 06/10/2022:\r\n* Benchmarking-wise, the `Evaluator()` class of `gluonts` requires about 3 adapters to make it work with `sktime`. I do recall exactly but one of the adapter would be for sktime's `metrics`. Need to consider additional options. There are 2 candidates: Kotsu and OpenML\r\n* Kotsu is a high level and light-weight package that performs benchmarking that has no dependency on specific packages. At a high level, it allows users to register a dataset with a predicting task and then apply estimators to that registration. Will need more investigation about application to sktime.\r\n* OpenML performs a similar task to kotsu. An additional plus is that such registration has a share-able ID that can be shared on the cloud, allowing other users to repeat the same task. At the moment, it has limited support for time series dataset. Will also need to investigate its application in `sktime`.\r\n\r\n**To do tasks (High priority):**\r\n- [x] Investigate the implementation of `kotsu` into `sktime` - refer to Issue #2804\r\n- [x] Investigate implementation of `OpenML` into sktime - refer to Issue #2821\r\n- [x] Investigate implementaition of  `Mlflow` into sktime - refer to Issue #2916 \r\n- [x] Compare available benchmarking approaches\r\n- [ ] Converter for Multiindex DF into ListDataset -- refer to Issue #2860 \r\n- [ ] Converter for ListDataset into Multiindex DF\r\n\r\nUpdate: 6/20/2022\r\n- [x] kotsu's experiment: Test all estimators for point forecasting\r\n- [x]  kotsu's experiment: Test all estimators for interval forecasting\r\n- [ ] kotsu's experiment: Investigate Issue #2742\r\n- [ ] Prep M4 dataset for

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n-->\n\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n<!--\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\n\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\n-->\nPartial solution to Issue #2860\n\nContinuation from PR# 2893\n\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\n-->\nImplement an adapter to convert multiindex format to ListDataset in gluon-ts\nThe method takes as input a pd-multiindex DataFrame, (optional) a list of categorical feature, (optional) the startdate and (optional) frequency of the dataset. \n\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\n\n<!--\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\n-->\nDependency: gluon-ts\n\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\n\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\n\nTesting with different dataset in sktime to weed out the bugs. So far, Arrowhead, ItalyPoowerDemand and [StandWalkJump](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php) have been tested.\n\n#### Any other comments?\n<!--\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\n-->\n\n#### PR checklist\n<!--\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\n-->\n\n##### For all contributions\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\n\n##### For new estimators\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\n\n\n<!--\nThanks for contributing!\n-->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"TNTran92","id":55965636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTY1NjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92","html_url":"https://github.com/TNTran92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-20T07:01:28Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T07:01:28Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3061","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3061/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3061/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3061/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3061","id":1310543579,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc47tKVl","number":3061,"title":"[ENH]

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
