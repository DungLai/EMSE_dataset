The example already expects columns for case id and dimension id (which could both have a single value for the simple 1d forecasting case). Class value is trickier; the way I handled it previously was to have an optional arg in the method for the dimension \"name\" of the class value, and could then handle that as appropriate if it was present, but that was a little messy. I just stuck to loading the data in the current code and assume the class values are loaded separately (not necessarily the best or final solution though) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/487909512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2323913558,"node_id":"MDI2Ok1vdmVkQ29sdW1uc0luUHJvamVjdEV2ZW50MjMyMzkxMzU1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2323913558","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-07T11:44:33Z","project_card":{"id":20654947,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/20654947","project_id":2046129,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/2046129","column_name":"In progress","previous_column_name":"ToDo"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/545883877","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/47#issuecomment-545883877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/47","id":545883877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTg4Mzg3Nw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-24T11:57:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T11:57:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@jasonlines @TonyBagnall Is this still relevant or has it been solved?
