We need to add functionality to support GPU and multi-GPU:\r\n\r\nFor GPU functionality:\r\n1. A user would need tensorflow-gpu and cuda-toolkit installed. We will have to add them as a soft dependency? I am unsure if these are required since pytorch (which I am comfortable with) does not really require them\r\n2. We can also have the functionality of multi-gpu: https://keras.io/guides/distributed_training/ . In my estimate majority of the people using sktime would be on kaggle / collab in which case there is a single gpu used. And time series data should not be so heavy that multi-gpu are required, but there might be few using it on larger data / maybe college gpu cluster where they might have easy access to gpus and would prefer running the models with multiple gpus?

In which case we should probably either add it for all (simply use sklearn's `train_test_split` or not use here as well)\r\n\r\nI think in general this is a good idea!\r\n\r\nThe specific implementation needs to be discussed though - we should not be adding parameters to `fit`, it is really important that all estimators \"look the same\".\r\n\r\nWhat would the parameter do? And could it maybe be added as an init option?\r\nWould be interested to see what you have in mind, if you could write it up, say, in the form of docstrings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1186978626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7046392059,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5NOfI3zwAAAAGj_2j7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7046392059","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T13:07:52Z","project_card":{"id":84002284,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/84002284","project_id":14526666,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/14526666","column_name":"In
