PR is a refactor of the `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier`.\r\n\r\nIt does three things:\r\n* removes the (in my opinion) awkward and hard-to-maintain double inheritance of `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` from `sklearn`'s knn classifier. Instead adopts a wrapper pattern around the `sklearn` public interface, with much of the code simplified through passing distance matrices directly to `sklearn`.\r\n* extends the interface to allow passing of arbitrary distances that are callables. This supports the composable distance interface from #1858 out-of-the-box (with `sklearn` style parameter inspectable composition/pipelining), and can be used to plug in custom time series distances.\r\n* tests that rely on random seeds are updated with new expected output values\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes two unreported bugs:\r\n* the `algorithm` parameter of `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` was not passed to the `sklearn` `KNeighbors` classifier, the value being passed was always the default `\"brute\"`. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2774\r\n* corrected docstring in `pairwise_distance` which was missing options\r\n\r\nand makes one minor change:\r\n* replaces loops in tests for `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` by
