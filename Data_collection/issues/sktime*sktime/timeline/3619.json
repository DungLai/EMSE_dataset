I fixed it by simply converting the index of `pdf` to absolute time index:\r\n```\r\npdf.index = pdf.index + datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1)\r\n```\r\nWould this be an option that you may consider? I doubt that sktime supports relative data indices.\r\n\r\nRegarding approach 2. Indeed, you are right `np.timedelta64` is very counterintuitively a subclass of `np.integer`. Here is the corresponding issue in NumPy: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10685. Unfortunately, it seems to be stalled for 2 years. Just to move you forward with your own project, could you please tell me why converting to `pd.Timedelta` is a dead end for you? Why is PySpark to blame? In your script pandas is already imported, so why not add one conversion line? I am genuinely interested in your answer as I had some minimal experience with PySpark in my previous job.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1287801049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7646095798,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5UXFljzwAAAAHHvim2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7646095798","actor":{"login":"gerarddet","id":113707464,"node_id":"U_kgDOBscJyA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113707464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet","html_url":"https://github.com/gerarddet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-22T13:59:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7646095801,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5UXFljzwAAAAHHvim5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7646095801","actor":{"login":"gerarddet","id":113707464,"node_id":"U_kgDOBscJyA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113707464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet","html_url":"https://github.com/gerarddet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-22T13:59:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-22T14:17:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-22T14:17:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3627","id":1419323325,"no

Of course, that makes it a bit harder to understand the actual time for a data point, but it does get past the problem.  I’m only using timedeltas during development, when we don’t have full data.  But I wanted to report the error, since the docs indicate it is a supported option.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you for the #3627<https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3627> fix.  Is it now included in the nightly build.  I’d like to download it and test it.\r\n\r\nThanks again !\r\nScott Gerard\r\n\r\nFrom: Stanislav Khrapov ***@***.***>\r\nReply-To: sktime/sktime ***@***.***>\r\nDate: Saturday, October 22, 2022 at 9:59 AM\r\nTo: sktime/sktime ***@***.***>\r\nCc: Scott Gerard ***@***.***>, Mention ***@***.***>\r\nSubject: Re: [sktime/sktime] [BUG] Can't create usable ForecastHorizon with timedeltas (Issue #3619)\r\n\r\n\r\n@gerarddet<https://github.com/gerarddet> Thanks a lot for reporting the issue and providing so many helpful details.\r\n\r\nRegarding approach 1. I fixed it by simply converting the index of pdf to absolute time index:\r\n\r\npdf.index = pdf.index + datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1)\r\n\r\nWould this be an option that you may consider? I doubt that sktime supports relative data indices.\r\n\r\nRegarding approach 2. Indeed, you are right np.timedelta64 is very counterintuitively a subclass of np.integer. Here is the corresponding issue in NumPy: numpy/numpy#10685<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10685>. Unfortunately, it seems to be stalled for 2 years. Just to move you forward with your own project, could you please tell me why converting to pd.Timedelta is a dead end for you? Why is PySpark to blame? In your script pandas is already imported, so why not add one conversion line? I am genuinely interested in your answer as I had some minimal experience with PySpark in my previous job.\r\n\r\n—\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3619#issuecomment-1287801049>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/A3DQTSDVBTKDTBIRSW2A2PTWEPXM5ANCNFSM6AAAAAARJK6LVY>.\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: ***@***.***>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1289079745/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gerarddet","id":113707464,"node_id":"U_kgDOBscJyA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113707464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet","html_url":"https://github.com/gerarddet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7654291034,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5UXFljzwAAAAHIOzZa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7654291034","actor":{"login":"gerarddet","id":113707464,"node_id":"U_kgDOBscJyA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113707464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet","html_url":"https://github.com/gerarddet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-24T13:58:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7654291045,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5UXFljzwAAAAHIOzZl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7654291045","actor":{"login":"gerarddet","id":113707464,"node_id":"U_kgDOBscJyA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113707464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet","html_url":"https://github.com/gerarddet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerarddet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-24T13:58:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
