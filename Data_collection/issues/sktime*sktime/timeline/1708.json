recently suggested to use of abc for classifiers in *#1873, #1708), and this was also previously discussed a number of times: #1424, #1708, #510, #420.\r\n\r\nI do think we need to work out a STEP for this, it would be a major change to the interface framework.\r\n\r\nThere are some open questions that I have:\r\n* which classes would inherit from `ABCMeta`?\r\n* how do we deal with optional abstract methods?\r\n* how does this integrate with the tag system in `BaseObject`? This could be updated using `ChainMap`.\r\n* are there any problematic interactions of the public/private nesting pattern `fit`/`_fit`?\r\n* we would still like to have capability tags that tell us whether an optional method is implemented or not, e.g., `predict_proba` or `predict_interval`. How would this interact with `abc`?\r\n* how would downwards compatibility and deprecation work here?\r\n* what about polymorphic estimators, e.g., a pipeline that can act like a transformer or a forecaster? Would `abc` not complain about missing transformer methods if it happens to behave like a forecaster and vice versa?\r\n\r\nThere's probably more once we have a proper design discussion, this is only off the top of my head.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1019566671","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1708#issuecomment-1019566671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1708","id":1019566671,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc48xVpP","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-23T21:02:32Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T21:03:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"well - I there is a more serious design issue in the background.\r\n\r\nWe need to work out how we would be using `abc`, which classes inherit from it.\r\nI would be very reluctant to do this only for
