well I implemented it in Java in 2014 or so, and it was a bit tricky iirc. It starts off like TSF with added features, but then does some other stuff. I liased with the author but could not recreate results, so it may be buggy. It was much slower than TSF and not more accurate, so we left it as it is and didnt bother porting it over. Possible to do so, but dont think it would add a huge amount of value to sktime. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/blob/master/src/main/java/tsml/classifiers/interval_based/TSBF.java\r\nmy comments (written over 5 years ago ....)\r\nPARAMETERS\r\n    minimum interval length: wmin=5;   \r\n    bin size for codebook generation in phase 2:   binsize=10      \r\nVARIABLES\r\n    number of intervals per subseries \r\n            numIntervals=(int)((zLevel*seriesLength)/wmin);\r\n    number of subseries:    \r\n            numSub=  (seriesLength/wmin)-numIntervals;\r\n\r\n1.
