refactoring, I cam across `Catch22` (a feature extractor comparable to tsfresh).\r\n\r\nThis looks very useful, but the code is a bit of a mess (old legacy code structure) and should be refactored as follows, imo:\r\n\r\n* the estimator needs to comply with the transformer interface, e.g., `transform` moved to `_transform` and input checks removed etc. I've started with that already in #2253\r\n* `_transform` should return a `pd.DataFrame`, with columns being the names in `feature_names`\r\n* `Catch22` should accept a parameter `features` such as used in various functions. This is a `str` or list of `str`, of codes in `feature_names`. If passed, the transformer will calculate only those features.\r\n* `X_inner_mtype` should also accept `pd.DataFrame`, i.e., a single series (in which case no loop is run over instances)\r\n* the docstring should describe all parameters properly.\r\n\r\nGood first issue, I think - most of these changes should be straightforward, albeit a bit fiddly.\r\n\r\nBonus: `_transform` works for multivariate input, output `pd.DataFrame` columns are `pd.Multiindex` named `(variable_name, feature_name)`. Not advised to do this in the first PR, this may be fiddly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1182643062","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2982#issuecomment-1182643062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2982","id":1182643062,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5GfbN2","user":{"login":"benfulcher","id":4446070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDYwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4446070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher","html_url":"https://github.com/benfulcher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benfulcher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-13T00:53:11Z","updated_at":"2022-07-13T00:53:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- 6 of these feature sets are combined in [`theft`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/theft) (R) (along with comprehensive visualization and analytic tools).\r\n- And FYI, there is active work in re-coding some of the [`hctsa`](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) Matlab time-series feature library into python [here](https://github.com/fairscape/hctsa-py).
