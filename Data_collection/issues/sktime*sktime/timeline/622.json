@ngupta23 \r\nActually the `Backtest` class would be similar to `GridSearchCV`. However I tried to use grid search to do a backtest and didnt get the expected result. Lets start with what I want to do and the worklflow of `Backtest`, then below I will give the example I tried with `GridSearchCV`.\r\n\r\n1) Assumptions\r\nLets do some assumptions for an example to make it cleear:\r\n- We take the airline data from the notebook example (`load_airline()`) with `freq=M`\r\n- I want to build a model with `fh=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]`, so basically forecast all months of the next year on the end of each year.\r\n\r\n2) Workflow:\r\nWith this assumptions I want to know how well my trained model is performing, so I can do a train-test-split and take the last 12 months as test data. However, this can tell me only how the model would have performed in the last year. If I take now a bigger test data with last 24 months, I violate my assumption of only forecast 12 month (and the additional 12 months will have also a worse error, so this will be a bias). Here comes the need for a `Backtest` class (and also an expanding window splitter), because e.g. I want to backtest my model on last 5 years. So here a sketch on this example, with an expanding window splitter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29627036/104759607-71a44500-5760-11eb-9dc4-76f2c517db5e.png)\r\n\r\nWithin this 5 model fits, I also want also to be able to do a grid search. This is because in production I also would most likely do it after each year because I have new data and might find better hyperparameters. \r\n\r\n3) Example using `GridSearchCV` to backtest:\r\nNow what I tried so far. \r\n```python\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    initial_window=84,\r\n    window_length=12,\r\n    step_length=12)\r\n\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(\r\n    forecaster=TBATS(), param_grid={\"sp\": [12]}, cv=cv, scoring=sMAPE()\r\n)\r\ngscv.fit(y_train)\r\npd.DataFrame(gscv.cv_results_)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29627036/104764707-0f4f4280-5768-11eb-9238-3a57d5b41cca.png)\r\n\r\nIn case I dont want to do grid search but just use the `SlidingWindowSplitter`, I have to anyway provide `param_grid={\"sp\": [12]}` which looks a bit strange, because I would like to just do `TBATS(sp=12)` without providing `param_grid` values. I figured out I can just do `param_grid={}` to get it running. The main point is however rather the `cv_results_`, where I would like to see 5 rows now because I have fitted 5 models and I need to exactly know how each of them has performed. Further I would like to get the average error for the 5 years, this is what is currently returned in this 1 row I think. The `Backtest` class could then also have plot function to make a nice plot of the backtest.\r\n\r\nBtw can s.o. explain me the `initial_window` argument of `SlidingWindowSplitter` in context of my example? 😃  I am not sure if I have set this value correctly here? \r\n\r\nIn case I want to do grid search, I would have to nest two grid searches:\r\n```python\r\ncv_1 = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    initial_window=84,\r\n    window_length=12,\r\n    step_length=1)\r\n\r\ncv_2 = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    initial_window=84,\r\n    window_length=12,\r\n    step_length=12)\r\n\r\ngscv_1 = ForecastingGridSearchCV(\r\n    forecaster=TBATS(), param_grid={\"sp\": [6, 12], \"use_box_cox\": [True, False]}, cv=cv_1, scoring=sMAPE()\r\n)\r\n\r\ngscv_2 = ForecastingGridSearchCV(\r\n    forecaster=gscv_1, param_grid={}, cv=cv_2, scoring=sMAPE()\r\n)\r\ngscv.fit(y_train)\r\npd.DataFrame(gscv.cv_results_)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29627036/104764776-242bd600-5768-11eb-8195-9dafefcef548.png)\r\n\r\nBtw I am wondering why there is no `use_box_cox` in the params column?\r\n\r\nSo long story short: From UX and what I would like to have as return it would be nice to have a `Backtest` class.

, Here are my initial thoughts and understanding on this. \r\n\r\nI think your use of `initial_window` is more or less Ok (you may want to use 72 instead of 84 though because of the following) - \r\n* For each of the candidate parameters in the `param_grid`, the model is trained on the `initial_window` first. \r\n* Then the `window_length` of data is appended to the `initial_window` data (essentially expanding window, if you use `start_with_window`=`True`) and the prediction is made which is used for evaluation. So in your example, data will be expanded from 72 to 84 and then future prediction will be made beyond that and those will be used for evaluation. \r\n* This process is repeated until you reach the end of the data (keep appending window length of data and making prediction and evaluation.\r\n\r\nThere are a few caveats though based on my analysis. \r\n\r\n* I found that in some (maybe all?) cases, it is only doing 1 step ahead prediction in the expanding window phase. When I tried adding a forecast horizon of 12 points, it gave an error that this is not supported yet.\r\n* When the window is expanded, in some cases (maybe all?), the model parameters are not refit. It retains the same model parameters that were learned in the `initial_window`. See discussion on this topic here (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/621). I think for backtesting, you want to refit it at each expanding window.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/761169044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4212746514,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIxMjc0NjUxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4212746514","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-15T20:01:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4212746518,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMTI3NDY1MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4212746518","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-15T20:01:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/761573643","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/622#issuecomment-761573643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/622","id":761573643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTU3MzY0Mw==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-16T14:36:19Z","updated_at":"2021-01-16T14:38:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@aiwalter, thanks for your suggestion - I think having robust functionality for quick evaluation and backtesting is a great idea.\r\n\r\nHowever, in summary of my answer below:\r\n* I do *not* think backtesting should be a class like `GridSearchCV`, butpart of  an \"external\" benchmarking module\r\n* it would be great if you would like to contribute to building that!\r\n\r\nSo, why should backtesting not be a class like `GridSearchCV`?\r\nBecause backtesting, or more generally performance evaluation workflows, are not the same as tuning strategies.\r\n\r\nA tuning strategy still is a forecaster/estimator, but a performance evaluation workflow isn't. A forecaster is subjected to a performance evaluation workflow. Both may use re-sampling (e.g., cross-validation or temporal re-sampling), but still they aren't the same kinds of formal objects.\r\n\r\nFor this same reason, `sklearn`'s `GridSearchCV` should not be used for benchmarking or performance evaluation, because instances of it are representations of estimators, not evaluation workflows.\r\n\r\nSome more detail on this, in my opinion, crucial distinction between tuning and evaluation workflows can be found in Section 5.1 of this paper on AI toolbox software design: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04938 (compare: anti-pattern 4; we seem to have been pre-scient here :smiley: )\r\n\r\nSomewhat confusingly, the same re-sampling technique can be used in a tuning workflow as well as in an evaluation workflow.\r\nFor example, cross-validation is used inside `GridSearchCV` - to obtain performance estimates which are then used in tuning - and in evaluation workflows - to obtain performance estimates.\r\n\r\nIn terms of software design, the former should be an estimator class (with a higher-order scitype), but hte latter shouldn't be, even if both use the same re-sampling technique.\r\nEvaluation should be on the workflow layer, and calls subject to something like\r\n`benchmark(estimator, Backtesting(config), metrics)`\r\nor\r\n`Benchmarking.run()` (after construction with config setting)\r\n\r\nDoes this distinction make sense?\r\n\r\nBtw, @ViktorKaz has been working on the design of benchmarking workflows for a while.\r\nThe newest for `sktime` is in this extension proposal here: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/pull/5\r\nI would suggest you think of contributing and/or designing the evaluation workflow(s)?\r\n\r\nThere is an also earlier toolbox we've written

thanks for your comment here. Before I start coding, one more question: What is the intention of an additional  `Benchmarking` class? I think what we need as input for a backtest is a splitter (e.g. `SlidingWindowSplitter`), a forecaster, a score function (e.g. `smape_loss`) and the data. So would it be ok to design the interface as I wrote initially?\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> class Backtest(object):\r\n>     \"\"\"Backtest forecasters\r\n> \r\n>     Parameters\r\n>     ----------\r\n>     forecaster: estimator object\r\n>     splitter: splitter object\r\n>         e.g. SlidingWindowSplitter\r\n>     score: function\r\n>         A function like smape_loss that has y_pred, y_test as arguments and returns a float\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThe data could be given then in `backtest.run(y)`?
