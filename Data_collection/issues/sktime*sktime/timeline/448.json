Have you gotten closer to figuring out if this will remain a goal for the project?\r\n\r\nI really miss a serious toolbox for generalized time series data that does cover more than the \"ordinal sequence\" subset of this space.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/801772265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"harahu","id":6145801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDU4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6145801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu","html_url":"https://github.com/harahu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/801794382","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/448#issuecomment-801794382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/448","id":801794382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTc5NDM4Mg==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-18T10:08:25Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T10:08:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi @harahu, unfortunately we haven't made much progress in that direction.

What other tools have you worked with so far to handle that kind of data?\r\n\r\nMostly custom developed tooling, based on pandas, where calculations are done by first \"translating\" the general data formats mentioned above to more limited formats expected by mainstream time series tooling. Not highly efficient. In other words, I have never actually experienced a tool set that makes it easy to work with this kind of data. A semi-exception might be [traces](https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/traces), by @stringertheory et al. They have a great API design that makes working with ragged, time heterogeneous data easy, but I don't think the internals make it scalable to truly big datasets and massive computation. \r\n\r\n@fkiraly:\r\n> I believe it's quite common in \"serious\" applications, equal length, equal time points etc is often a bit artificial...\r\n\r\nThat is my experience as well. My domain is sensor data from process industry. It is quite common for me to be looking at datasets that span multiple years, consisting of a mix of high and low frequency channels. It is then common to represent it in a \"sparse\" way, where you only get a reading when there is an actual change in the signal, to avoid low frequency channels eating up valuable memory. The assumption is that you can usually just forward fill the last seen value to any time point to get a continuously valid signal.

I don't know much about the alternatives you are evaluating either, like awkward arrays.

@harahu, no worries about @-ing, this is interesting, and I'm happy to learn about Awkward Arrays. They seem useful!\r\n\r\nI agree with all the points in this thread:\r\n\r\n- time-heterogeneous data is common in practice, especially with sensors and other event-driven systems\r\n- [traces](https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/traces) is intended for time-heterogeneous data, but prioritizes ease of use on messy small-to-medium datasets over scalability (e.g. I find that I start getting impatient with it around ~10 million points or so on a laptop)\r\n- also +1 to what @mloning mentions around needing to extend time series algorithms. Even the underlying [theory/methodology for time-heterogeneous data is lacking](http://www.eckner.com/papers/Algorithms%20for%20Unevenly%20Spaced%20Time%20Series.pdf) and/or very specialized according to specific use cases. For \"basic\" algorithms like a Fast Fourier Transform, time-heterogeneous data requires fundamental changes in the algorithms or a translation to even spacing, and there [are lots of ways to do it](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/593/how-do-i-take-the-fft-of-unevenly-spaced-data).\r\n\r\nAs you mention, whenever I need to use a more powerful toolset for time series analysis, I also end up making a (careful) translation to evenly-spaced data.\r\n\r\nIf anyone digs into this, it might be worth investigating the most efficient way of interpolating between time points in time-heterogenous data (maybe using or inspired by [scipy interpolation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html#scipy.interpolate.interp1d)?). That's ultimately what is needed in order to apply the toolset that's intended for evenly-spaced data. Traces uses [sortedcontainers](https://github.com/grantjenks/python-sortedcontainers) for that (sortedcontainers is a great library!), but maybe there are ways of interpolating between points in Awkward Arrays that would be more scalable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/802115505/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stringertheory","id":1110950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTA5NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1110950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory","html_url":"https://github.com/stringertheory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stringertheory/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4477493488,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ3NzQ5MzQ4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4477493488","actor":{"login":"harahu","id":6145801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDU4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6145801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu","html_url":"https://github.com/harahu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-18T17:02:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4477493493,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0Nzc0OTM0OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4477493493","actor":{"login":"harahu","id":6145801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDU4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6145801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu","html_url":"https://github.com/harahu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harahu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-18T17:02:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4477493499,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ3NzQ5MzQ5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4477493499","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-18T17:02:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
