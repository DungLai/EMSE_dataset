here for overview of recent test framework related PRs:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2053\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis experimental PR continues carrying out the test refactor, and turns `test_all_estimators` into multiple test classes.\r\n\r\nThe expected benefits are:\r\n* easy use of tests in sister packages, extension packages, packages adopting the `sktime`interface, or custom local use cases\r\n* \"run tests\" one-method call to run all tests for one estimator\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the pre-PR logic in `test_all_estimators` is moved into two classes:\r\n* `BaseFixtureGenerator`, which takes responsibility for fixture generation\r\n* `TestAllEstimators`, which contains all the tests, and inherits from `BaseFixtureGenerator`\r\n\r\n`pytest` automatically discovers the tests in `TestAllEstimators` with fixtures coming from `BaseFixtureGenerator`, so there should be zero change to the test logic. This part is only a structural refactor.\r\n\r\n`BaseFixtureGenerator` is designed to provide extension by inheritance, i.e., it is meant to be customized by inheritance overrides, such as for use in module tests in `sktime`, or external packages.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds another class, `QuickTester`, which is a mixin that adds the method `run_tests`. This can be invoked on any estimator or estimator instance, and will run all tests in `TestAllEstimators` only for that estimator. In the future, this can be used in any other test class we may write in the future based on the same design.\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n* `create_conditional_fixtures_and_names` will ignore fixture variables for which no generators exist (i.e., no keys in the generator dict), instead of erroring out\r\n* fixes bug in `get_fixtures` on return handling in rare case where precisely to fixtures are returned and no names. In this case, the list would be split, instead of adding names, because only `len` and not the type was checked.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-12T13:47:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-12T13:47:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1992","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1992/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1992/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1992/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/1992","id":1125021305,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc4yH5xt","number":1992,"title":"[ENH]

framework.\r\n\r\nPost-PR, the order is *first* loop over estimators, *then* loop over test modules, *then* loop over individual tests.\r\n\r\nPre-PR, the order was *first* loop over test modules, *then* loop over indivdual tests, *then* loop over estimators.\r\n\r\nThe post-PR order is somewhat similar to the original loop order of @mloning's framework, which was:\r\n*first* loop over test modules, *then* loop over estimators, *then* loop over individual tests.\r\n\r\nImplementation-wise:\r\n* there is now just a single \"big test\" per estimator, `test_estimators_all_tests` in `test_all_estimators`.\r\n* this uses the `check_estimator` utility from PR #1993 to loop over all estimator tests for an individual estimator\r\n* which in turn uses the framework refactor to test classes in PR #1992 and #1987\r\n\r\nHopefully, this will reduce memory usage, since tests are chunked by estimators, and estimator related artefacts persist only for the duration of that chunk, as opposed to throughout the testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2054/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-25T23:32:16Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T23:32:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2141","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2141/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2141/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2141/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/2141","id":1150967539,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc4zfbxq","number":2141,"title":"[ENH]

is the consolidated end state of the test framework maintenance over multiple PR in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2053.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n* it begins to move tests to classes, so they can be reused easily, e.g., in other packages\r\n* it reintroduces `pytest-xdist` with 2 workers to speed up the tests\r\n\r\nTest classes are introduced in the following modules:\r\n* test_all_estimators`, this is a simple move from loose functions to class structure. This is a 1:1 replicate of https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1987\r\n* refactor `test_all_forecasters` along the lines of this architecture, from https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1992\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes minor changes to the conditional fixtures plugin: \r\n* producing more readable test names\r\n* fixing a bug that could occur if the fixture list was length two (it would be confused with a tuple return, since only length and not type was checked)\r\n* added comments throughout the fixture parameter tuple construction that clarify what is happening\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the diffs in `test_all_estimators` and `test_all_forecasters` look intimidating, but are mostly caused by added indentation - as functions move to the classes, a single indentation is added to most code, and a \"self\" argument is added to the function signature. Some fixtures are moved to the generator functions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
