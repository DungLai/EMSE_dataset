in my experience, I think the general interpretation for a typical HMM is that $X$ is usually not observed at all, and I think it is quite common for $X$ to be discrete and to be interpreted as a label. \r\n\r\nUsually in an HMM, you are less interested in predicting $y_{t+1}$ from $y_t$.  This is usually because you already have all the $Y$.  What is the interesting data analysis question here is connecting the observed $Y$ to some $X$ \"label\" or \"hidden state\" that you would like to assign to the raw data ($Y$). \r\n\r\nWhich is just to say I think the first point you raise is closest to the typical use case of an HMM.  One can think of it as a transformation I suppose!  But one can also call it annotation.  I feel the difference is probably mostly semantics, but I think given the typical use case it might make sense for HMM to live in an annotations folder rather than transformations.

wanted to share a draft PR of what I have been working on with HMM estimator. \r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>More Details:</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n- rather than assuming a particular emission distribution function, which I believe is what `hmmlearn` does (ie you can choose to use a Guassian HMM vs a Multinomial Discrete HMM, and you need to either build, or hope an HMM with your emission distribution has already been built), we simply accept a list of functions which behave as pdf and use those to calculate the emission probability.  The viterbi algorithm gets to treat those as a black box. \r\n    - the hope here is that we can add some functionality which automatically generates some nice functions for people if needed (ie give me an n-dimensional gaussian!), but it also gives the flexibility to do more interesting things!  - Have an empirical distribution you want to act as a \"pdf\"?  Have some other distribution you are getting from some other system that you would like to use? As long as it can return a valid probability then it *should* work with our HMM estimator, no need to write your own!\r\n- I have spent some time optimizing the algorithms with numpy (in particular, the `_calculate_trans_mats` function which is the slowest part), the plan is to push this a bit more and then conduct speed tests between this draft estimator and `hmmlearn`, so we can have a more quantitative comparison of speed. \r\n- I implemented a very simple version of a base object, named `SimpleBaseEstimator` and used that here.  It is very similar to what Lukasz did in his annotation flavored PR actually, just added in the `get_params()` and `set_params()` functions, which are technically required for it to be a sklearn like estimator. \r\n    - I am not proposing we replace our Base Object with what I wrote at all, just wanted to see how many of the bells and whistles in Base Estimator I could get away without! Again - just for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example of how to use it: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.annotation.hmm import HMM\r\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\r\nfrom numpy import asarray\r\n\r\ncenters = [3.5,-5]\r\nsd = [.25 for i in centers]\r\nemi_funcs = [(norm.pdf, {'loc': mean, 'scale': sd[ind]}) for ind, mean in enumerate(centers)]\r\n\r\ntest = HMM(emi_funcs, asarray([[0.25,0.75], [0.666, 0.333]]))\r\nobs = asarray([3.7,3.2,3.4,3.6,-5.1,-5.2,-4.9])\r\ntest.fit(obs)\r\nprint(test.predict())\r\n```\r\n\r\n<\\details>\r\n\r\n@fkiraly, @lmmentel, @GuzalBulatova \r\n   ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2855/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1230282297","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2799#issuecomment-1230282297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2799","id":1230282297,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5JVJ45","user":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T13:15:00Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T13:15:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"This has now been implemented, though I am in the process of further improving the HMM ecosystem in #3099 Progress on improvement can be tracked there, so closing this issue.
