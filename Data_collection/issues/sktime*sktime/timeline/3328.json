the request of @fkiraly I investigated the possibility to use pytest-testmon for testing in sktime. When I tested many different commits from sktime history testmon selected single to triple digit number of tests out of the 20K test suite. I also tested multiple commits which introduced a test failure and testmon did execute the right tests to expose the failure. Very encouraging!\r\n\r\nsktime code is tested from within site-packages installation after executing `pip install .` (pytest is then executed from a \"dummy\" subdirectory and using --pyargs sktime arguments) Unfortunately testmon doesn't support --pyargs . --pyargs support might not be added to testmon for a long time.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to suggest, to reconsider the usage of --pyargs. Philosophically the way sktime now tests is fine, of course. You're testing the form of the product which is closer to \"production\" than to development environment. However, I must point out many times it's not the \"production\" version anyway. The production would be a tar.gz or wheel package.\r\n\r\nI suggest normal test.yml would test the git source code (editable install, without --pyargs) this way: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/commit/903682ec5a3a8d3d9002a1d1f049ded1242fcf5d\r\n\r\n@lmmentel commented on this: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2389#issuecomment-1087828335\r\nbut I didn't experience any failiures when testing site-packages vs testing code from git repo.\r\n\r\nThe set of tests picked with --pyargs sktime vs sktime/ is a little different and I would probably need you guys to have a look at it and confirm it's fine or tweak it.\r\n\r\nAre you OK with executing test suite with `pytest sktime` instead of `pytest --pyargs sktime` ? Should I prepare the PR?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
