by @fkiraly: the below is not a bug, but a consequence of what seems like quite serious random variation in the prediction intervals and quantiles produced by `AutoETS`.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to investigate whether:\r\n* a random seed can be set in `AutoETS` to allow deterministic comparisons\r\n* whether the prediction intervals should be something different (e.g., variation predicted added to variation in re-sampling the prediction)\r\n* whether this fluctuation implies anything about the correctness of `AutoETS`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nFollowup from ##2275: AutoETS behavior still seems inconsistent in the 0.11.0 release (ARIMA and Theta has to be fixed now).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.ets import AutoETS\r\ny = load_airline()\r\n\r\nforecaster = AutoETS(auto=True, n_jobs=-1, sp=12)\r\nforecaster.fit(y, fh=[1,2,3])\r\n\r\n# return_pred_int and alpha are disabled in sktime 0.11.0\r\n# forecaster.predict(return_pred_int=True, alpha=0.05)\r\nforecaster.predict()\r\n\r\nforecaster.predict_quantiles(alpha=[0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.975])\r\n\r\nforecaster.predict_interval(coverage=[0.8, 0.9, 0.95])\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/160263672-3deed4ef-41cb-423a-9218-cab02994230b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWould have expected the point forecast to match 50% quantile and coverage = 80% to match quantiles [0.1, 0.9] and so on. This seems to be the case in ARIMA and ThetaForecaster but not in AutoETS.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.7.13 (default, Mar 16 2022, 17:37:17)  [GCC
