#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nSee the feature enhancement request [#1374](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1374)\r\n\r\n\r\n> #### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to add multiple custom seasonalities to the wrapped version of prophet. The prophet parameter `add_seasonality` can now be either a dictionary (for backward compatibility) or a list that contains multiple dictionaries, each one of them adds a different custom seasonality.\r\n\r\n> #### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n> #### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThere's not much code changes.\r\n\r\n> #### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nI really appreciate this library/project and this is my first PR ever ^^ .\r\n\r\n> #### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass

Reference Issues/PRs\r\nStart working on #984\r\n\r\nStarted with the refactor of the base class. Following STEP 12 and discussion in #984\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n* add todo's for what needs to be deprecated/where deprecation warnings will be needed\r\n* have everything that is supposed to be deprecated in `predict()` in an additional else statement\r\n* add abstract method with signature `predict_interval(self, fh=None, X=None, alpha=Union[float, np.ndarray[float, dim=1]]) -> pd.DataFrame` \r\n* make `predict()` call `predict_interval()` unless the boolean flag of `old_predict_interval_logic` is set to true\r\n* move methods related to prediction intervals that are specific to one particular forecaster to that forecaster, for now -> We can further refactor them there\r\n\t* more specifically: move `_get_pred_int` to `_tbats`; move `compute_pred_int` to `theta`, completly delete `_get_pred_int` and directly call `_compute_pred_err()` instead. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should the reviewers concentrate their feedback on\r\n* I think I followed precisely what is suggested in STEP 12, except for this one: \r\n       * STEP 12 suggests moving `_get_pred_int` to theta, but I think it should be safe to completely delete it.\r\n       \r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- `predict()` now contains code duplicates but I thought it would be good for readability to have everything that is going to be deprecated in one else statement such that it can easily be deleted.\r\n- As the next step I think we need to follow through with these changes in the inheriting classes before we can add the deprecation warning. But before implementing `_predict_interval()` in the inheriting classes, we should probably decide how the user can decide on the strategy for computing prediction intervals (either `PredIntervalAdder` or just as arguments in the constructor, see discussion about this in #984). \r\n\r\npinging @fkiraly and @mloning \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1421/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/951379594","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1194#issuecomment-951379594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1194","id":951379594,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc44tOaK","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T22:23:36Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T22:23:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"One possible solution would be to replace `time.time()` with `time.perf_counter()`.

We check if run times are always strictly positive, so this then raises the error. `time.perf_counter` should fix that because it's more precise. Why it's more precise is described in the above StackOverflow post.
