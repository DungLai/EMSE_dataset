PR adds a default `get_params`/`set_params` for the `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator` with varying part based on a private attribute, which can replace many of the copy/pasted `get_params`/`set_params` for concrete heterogeneous estimators.\r\n\r\nThis replaces abstract methods of the same name that raise an error if called.\r\n\r\nFor this to work as a replacement of copy-pasted methods in descendants, two changes are made:\r\n\r\n* `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator` no longer inherits from `BaseEstimator`, so is turned back into a mixin from a base class\r\n* descendants now must inherit from `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator` *before* a base class\r\n\r\nA full refactor is carried out to replace duplicated `get_params`/`set_params` with the default from `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator`.\r\n\r\nNo deprecation is necessary since the class is private, and the public interfaces do not change.\r\n\r\nTesting is via the main test suite's existing tests for the params interface points.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a bugfix to #3789, as pointed out by @hoesler, with the attribute accessed in `FeatureUnion` changed from `transformer_list` to `_transformer_list`.\r\n\r\nThe bugfix is certified by the test

In python, this translates to `{k: estimator[k] for estimator in estimators for k in estimator}`.\r\n\r\nBut what is `for k in estimator`? The answer is here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter\r\n> .... or it must support the sequence protocol (the __getitem__() method with integer arguments starting at 0)\r\n\r\nSince estimator has the `__getitem__` method, you can `iter()` it, which throws the infinite sequence at it 0,1,2,3,..... without ever returning `null`, which would stop the iteration.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess the lesson here is, be careful by implementing the `__getitem__` method, isn't it?
