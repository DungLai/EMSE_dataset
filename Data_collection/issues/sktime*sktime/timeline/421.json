sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nforecaster = ThetaForecaster(initial_level=0.5).fit(y)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should estimate Theta with initial smoothing level.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI think the problem relates to the class ExponentialSmoothing and the fact that users cannot provide the `initialization_method` argument.
