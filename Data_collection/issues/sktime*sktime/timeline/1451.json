#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #859 and #1441 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nWhen training an AutoArima you don't know what differencing order it'll land at so if data changes at some point you won't be able to do in sample forecasts for some points (earlier to diff order). This implementation makes predictions possible (without errors) if they're ealier to differencing order.\r\nIt also fixes a small problem with appending out of sample to in sample predictions when intervals are to be returned.\r\n\r\n> #### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

#### Describe the issue linked to the documentation\r\n\r\nThe ForecastGorizon interface allows seperated steps forecasting (like `fh=[-10, -5, 3]`) but the forecaster (like pmdarima) is performing in this case a forecast from -10 to 3. The documentation says:\r\n\r\n```\r\nX: pd.DataFrame, optional (default=None)\r\nExogeneous data\r\n```\r\nBut it doesn't explain that X should have all exogenous values from relative step -10 to 3 (because that's what pmdarima is expecting).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5473563133,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc48Ak_9zwAAAAFGP_H9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5473563133","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-16T22:45:45Z","rename":{"from":"[DOC] requirements/contracts given by tags should be explicit in docstrings","to":"[DOC] requirements/contracts given by tags should be explicit in docstrings of classifier base class"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7655095489,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc48Ak_9zwAAAAHIR3zB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7655095489","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-24T15:21:32Z","label":{"name":"module:classification","color":"BEB114"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
