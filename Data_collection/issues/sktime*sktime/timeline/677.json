so what I did was I tried to re-install on WSL2 because I remember the process was pretty easy. To make a long story short **it turned out to be a little bit confusing**.\r\n\r\nI want to test this out further to see if there's some form of regression between different python versions starting from python 3.5.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps (along with a few observations I encountered). My requirements.txt can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/luiszugasti/22e355ce8f4bc8924a4212c8b00cbbe9).\r\n\r\nHere goes:\r\n0. Create an environment in python3.8 `mkvirtualenv \"name_of_your_package\" -p python3.8`\r\n1. install pre-commit with `pip install pre-commit`\r\n2. checked out master (as per steps 1-4 of the [instructions](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/installation.html#development-version))\r\n3. `pip install cython` -> cython-0.29.22 (as per the reqs in the setup.py script)\r\n4. I already have the compilers for linux. So, I install numpy, scipy and cython.\r\n5. Go ahead to running `pip install --editable .`\r\n6. Go ahead and install the build tools `pip install -r build_tools/requirements.txt`. It uninstalls cython, numpy, pandas, and scipy from the previous step, which is silly\r\n7. Install docs too. `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`\r\n8. Run tests. If when running the tests you get an error from a Cython module complaining about size 88 being provided when 80 was expected, do the following:\r\n    - take requirements.txt from my gist, install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n    - Then instal the editable environment again. This will remove any stale packages (I think).\r\n\r\nAll tests will then run fine and docs will be able to be built.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/787089684/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"luiszugasti","id":11198457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk4NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11198457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti","html_url":"https://github.com/luiszugasti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4385101227,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDM4NTEwMTIyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4385101227","actor":{"login":"afzal442","id":11625672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjI1Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11625672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442","html_url":"https://github.com/afzal442","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-27T15:26:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4385101230,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzODUxMDEyMzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4385101230","actor":{"login":"afzal442","id":11625672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjI1Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11625672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442","html_url":"https://github.com/afzal442","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-27T15:26:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/819551357","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/677#issuecomment-819551357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/677","id":819551357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTU1MTM1Nw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-14T14:13:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T14:13:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"For
