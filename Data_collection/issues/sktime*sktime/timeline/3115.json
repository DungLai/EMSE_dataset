it is a conscious design choice to not return everything in `predict`. Why: `sktime` provides unified interfaces, where all estimators have the same return.\r\nSome things this enables, like in `scikit-learn`:\r\n\r\n* modularity, composability - easy building of pipelines, composites\r\n* looping over estimators/forecasters, benchmarking\r\n\r\nReturning 100 different things from `predict` would make that difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nYou can get prediction intervals and quantiles from `predict_quantiles`, `predict_interval`, many models have these, see the forecasting tutorial.\r\n\r\nRegarding model specific returns like `trend` (no other model has that?), there is no dedicated unified interface point for that.\r\nOne could always return it as part of `summary` or `get_fitted_params`, although that would not be specific to the forecasting horizon.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have a good idea, how to return the \"model specific\" things that depend on `fh`, without compromising the interface uniformity across all forecasters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1197823969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7079226642,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5OsvoizwAAAAGl9G0S","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7079226642","actor":{"login":"ealizadeh-via","id":84460342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDYwMzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84460342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via","html_url":"https://github.com/ealizadeh-via","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-28T08:23:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7079226648,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5OsvoizwAAAAGl9G0Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7079226648","actor":{"login":"ealizadeh-via","id":84460342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDYwMzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84460342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via","html_url":"https://github.com/ealizadeh-via","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ealizadeh-via/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-28T08:23:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7079227555,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc5OsvoizwAAAAGl9HCj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7079227555","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-28T08:23:19Z","label":{"name":"API
