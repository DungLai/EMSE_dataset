following question is emerging from two different workstreams, deep learning and pywatts.\r\n\r\nHow do we deal with mtypes that rely on soft dependencies? In the `datatypes` module.\r\n\r\nExample 1: `xarray` (series, panel, and hierarchical), as used in `pywatts`. FYI @benheid, @kalebphipps, @smeisen\r\nRelated: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2655\r\n\r\nExample 2: `ListDataset` (panel data), as used in `gluonts`. FYI @TNTran92, @AurumnPegasus, @ltsaprounis.\r\nRelated: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2893\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that adding examples naively, as of now, would attach the soft dependency imports to large parts of the `datatypes` module.\r\n\r\nSome ways out:\r\n\r\n* encapsulation as fixtures, similar to `pytest`, or directly via `pytest`, with imports inside the fixture. Plus, calling fixtures only when soft dependencies are installed.\r\n* relying on checks that does not import, or only imports late. E.g., instead of `isinstance(obj, ListDataset)`, use `type(obj).__name__ == \"ListDataset\"` etc.\r\n\r\nAny good ideas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2957/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"benHeid","id":9725296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjUyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9725296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid","html_url":"https://github.com/benHeid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-13T09:45:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-13T09:45:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3255","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3255/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3255/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3255/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3255","id":1337917016,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc49IMf7","number":3255,"title":"[ENH]

the bug**\r\nUpdatePredict only works with the mtypes pd.Series and pd.DataFrames even if the documentation states that also numpy is supported However, if numpy is selected an error is raised. Even if all are from the  scitype Series.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.ets import AutoETS\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nets = AutoETS()\r\nets.fit(np.random.random(100))\r\nets.update_predict(np.random.random(10))```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect that update_predict works with every mtype that implements the series scitype. If this is not possible, I would suggest that the documentation of update_predict in forecasting._base is updated. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI suppose that it would work if in line 2210 of forecasting._base the instance is checked against a list of all scitypes instead of only checked against the pd.Series and pd.DataFrames.\r\n\r\nIf it should also work with np.arrays, I can take a look if it is possible to check the against all mtypes.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects also the issues which proposes to add new mtypes.
