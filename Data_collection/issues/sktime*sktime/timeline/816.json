I just copie my slack Question here: \r\nI have a dataframe with some (35 columns) Variables and millions (rows) of timesteps. I would like to cut the data with the timeseriesgenerator (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/TimeseriesGenerator). I have done it before for some neural nets. I would like to stick to the generator, because I need to skip some samples, but how many isn't clear at the moment. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to use the generator also to provide the examples for sktime?\r\nI have a classification problem. The data is provided in a long mode. The generator does not provide timestamps. Or is there any workaround?\r\nI would like to use sktime, but failed to get the data in shape. The data contains a time variable, but there was a problem while recording.
