E.g., import an estimator and call the `set_tag` function with the tag of your choice and the value of your choice (for dynamic tags; for static tags, override/set the `_tag` attribute, this will work with the retrieval in `all_estimators`).\r\n\r\n`sktime` itself is, in-principle, also a good place.\r\nWe want to avoid having tags proliferate though, the more there are, the less useful the ones that are there are, and the more tags a developer may have to set if they extend `sktime` (although you could set \"defaults\").\r\n\r\nWhat would be really useful would be a list of suggested tags, with examples and reasons why you think it might be useful for the user. \r\nSo whenever you come up with a tag that could be useful, feel free to post them here.\r\n\r\nAbout the \"multiple seasonal period\" one, I'm really neutral. I've just been trying to understand what the user benefit is. So if the case is good enough, or enough users would find it useful, I'm willing to be convinced. You'll also need to convince the other core devs who'd be reviewing it. And if the reviewers are not convinced (for whatever reason), as said, you can always add the tags in your own package by using `sktime` onboard functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1011481708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1012136566","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1862#issuecomment-1012136566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1862","id":1012136566,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc48U_p2","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T13:28:30Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T13:28:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds good.
