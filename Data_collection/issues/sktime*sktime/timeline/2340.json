does work with Google colab, it needs to be installed the first time. and can be easily done. \r\nthe command for the installation of sktime is\r\n`!pip install sktime`\r\nthis code will install sktime in your colab notebook.\r\nTo check if it's rightly installed, run the following commands:\r\n`import sktime`\r\n`from sktime import datasets`\r\n`y=datasets.load_airline`\r\n`y`\r\n\r\nthis would generate a univariate data frame of values that can be matched with
