Three methods are implemented here out of the list in issue #2157\r\n - bottom up \r\n - ols\r\n - wls_var\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHierarchical reconciler which depends only on the structure of the hierarchy. The three methods are detailed [here](https://otexts.com/fpp3/hierarchical.html) and the code is constructed similar to the methodology as noted in these [slides](https://github.com/robjhyndman/reconciliation_review_talk/blob/main/10years_reconciliation.pdf). The only difference between the three methods is the construction of the \"G\" matrix.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2287/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ciaran-g","id":41995662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTk1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41995662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g","html_url":"https://github.com/ciaran-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciaran-g/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T15:12:39Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T15:12:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/2292","id":1179657199,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc409Wzr","number":2292,"title":"[ENH]

This is linked to PR #2287 and issue #2157\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA transformer that takes hierarchical observations at the bottom level of the hierarchy only, and sums them appropriately using the index. An identifier is placed in the index for aggregated nodes called `__total`. The reconciler implemented in #2287 use this identifier, so probably this is a better one to focus on first.\r\n\r\nAlso I noticed for some reason, if you pass an a non-multiindex type input to the transformer it doesn't raise an error like a guess it should given the tags filled in at the top of the script? I tried to include a test for this as well, but it only seems to work correctly when you call the hidden _transform function \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- The new g matrix function for top down - `_get_g_matrix_td_fcst()`\r\n- An update function for the g matrix for this method, which changes for each forecast - `_update_td_fcst()`\r\n- A function for returning a parent/child look up table for all methods - `_parent_child_df()`\r\n- Re-format of the `_transform()` function to incorporate the new method, also uses column/index matching with `df.dot()` now\r\n- Improvements to documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA new `ReconcilerForecaster` class which is a composite of a base forecaster and a reconciliation method. The idea/methods are similar to the `Reconciler`, except here the reconciliation matrix is estimated using variations on the base-forecast residual covariance matrix. The three methods either use the sample covariance matrix `method=\"mint_cov\"`, a shrunk covariance matrix `method=\"mint_shrink\"`, or only the on-diagonal elements `method=\"wls_var\"`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it would be easier or more intuitive for users if all of the reconciliation methods, including the transformers, were accessible though this estimator?\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6880827306,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5E-7KazwAAAAGaIReq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6880827306","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4742181e1b2dd0fbabd26bf8414239d57ac7a5e4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/4742181e1b2dd0fbabd26bf8414239d57ac7a5e4","created_at":"2022-06-26T20:02:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
