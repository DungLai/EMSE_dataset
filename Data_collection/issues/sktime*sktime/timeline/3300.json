@ngupta23, this relates to an old discussion here:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1480\r\n\r\nThere are two opposing poles in the discussion:\r\n* we should not have defensive version bounds, since that is not nice for reverse dependencies and, if everyone does this, it might ultimately lead to unsatisfiable constraint combinations\r\n* we should have defensive version bounds and bump them every release, because otherwise it can break user code that does not itself have defensive version bounds\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where the discussion was had since the issue #1480 only has my posts, but I remember a notably heated discussion  (@aiwalter, @lmmentel, @freddyaboulton, where is all th discussion?), and the current majority opinion among core developers is \"we should not have defensive version bounds and should gradually remove the ones in place\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can find a compromise and put defensive version founds for MAJOR but not MINOR
