Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nDemonstrate how OpenML's data format is incompatible with sktime.\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\n- In an OpenML dataset, each variable is in a column, each time point is a row, just like in a DataFrame.\r\n- Correction from daily stand-up: Not required to have `target` column but since OpenML does not support Pd.Series inside DataFrame => Need to turn time series into rolling-window format.\r\n- Because dataset has to be rolling window, adapters need to be made for .ts format, estimator, CV splitter and `metrics`\r\n- Still not sure how to make a 1:1 conversion of MultiIndex DataFrame to OpenML Dataset \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nYes, OpenML\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.

the benchmarking meeting today, a number of topics was discussed regarding benchmarking. This issue summarizes/expands these discussions. This documents will be updated after meetings:\r\nThree packages were among the discussions on 06/10/2022:\r\n* Benchmarking-wise, the `Evaluator()` class of `gluonts` requires about 3 adapters to make it work with `sktime`. I do recall exactly but one of the adapter would be for sktime's `metrics`. Need to consider additional options. There are 2 candidates: Kotsu and OpenML\r\n* Kotsu is a high level and light-weight package that performs benchmarking that has no dependency on specific packages. At a high level, it allows users to register a dataset with a predicting task and then apply estimators to that registration. Will need more investigation about application to sktime.\r\n* OpenML performs a similar task to kotsu. An additional plus is that such registration has a share-able ID that can be shared on the cloud, allowing other users to repeat the same task. At the moment, it has limited support for time series dataset. Will also need to investigate its application in `sktime`.\r\n\r\n**To do tasks (High priority):**\r\n- [x] Investigate the implementation of `kotsu` into `sktime` - refer to Issue #2804\r\n- [x] Investigate implementation of `OpenML` into sktime - refer to Issue #2821\r\n- [x] Investigate implementaition of  `Mlflow` into sktime - refer to Issue #2916 \r\n- [x] Compare available benchmarking approaches\r\n- [ ] Converter for Multiindex DF into ListDataset -- refer to Issue #2860 \r\n- [ ] Converter for ListDataset into Multiindex DF\r\n\r\nUpdate: 6/20/2022\r\n- [x] kotsu's experiment: Test all estimators for point forecasting\r\n- [x]  kotsu's experiment: Test all estimators for interval forecasting\r\n- [ ] kotsu's experiment: Investigate Issue #2742\r\n- [ ] Prep M4 dataset for sktime\r\n- [ ] Mock a benchmarking study with vanilla kotsu\r\n- [ ] kotsu's experiment: Draft interface design for kotsu\r\n- [ ] kotsu's experiment: Try with annotations\r\n\r\n\r\n**Good to have (Lower priority):**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional thoughts (Not action item)**\r\nIf implemented,  the `gluonts`'s adapter would look similar to statsmodel's
