fixes the following unreported bug related to https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2841 and https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2711:\r\n\r\nwhen a transformer entered vectorization mode and `y` was passed (and also vectorized), then the transformer would pass the vectorized `X` to the inner methods where a vectorized `y` should have passed, i.e., passing `X` as `X` (correctly), and `y` as `X` as well (incorrectly). This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n(was difficult to spot since the condition is a rare combination of (a) a transformer uses `y` at all, and (b) vectorization happens)\r\n\r\nRelation to the bugs:\r\n* after the type inference bug in #2841 is fixed, the test example posted by me breaks due to this unreported bug\r\n* in #2711, it seem like `X` in the forecaster is not properly aggregated. There is not a clear causal link, and the vectorization in forecasters seem correct. Still there is something going on that seems similar, so I reference it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1162190354","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2841#issuecomment-1162190354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2841","id":1162190354,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5FRZ4S","user":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-21T18:51:21Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T18:52:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@CelieDs
