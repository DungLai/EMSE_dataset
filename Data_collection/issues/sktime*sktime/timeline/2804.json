the benchmarking meeting today, a number of topics was discussed regarding benchmarking. This issue summarizes/expands these discussions. This documents will be updated after meetings:\r\nThree packages were among the discussions on 06/10/2022:\r\n* Benchmarking-wise, the `Evaluator()` class of `gluonts` requires about 3 adapters to make it work with `sktime`. I do recall exactly but one of the adapter would be for sktime's `metrics`. Need to consider additional options. There are 2 candidates: Kotsu and OpenML\r\n* Kotsu is a high level and light-weight package that performs benchmarking that has no dependency on specific packages. At a high level, it allows users to register a dataset with a predicting task and then apply estimators to that registration. Will need more investigation about application to sktime.\r\n* OpenML performs a similar task to kotsu. An additional plus is that such registration has a share-able ID that can be shared on the cloud, allowing other users to repeat the same task. At the moment, it has limited support for time series dataset. Will also need to investigate its application in `sktime`.\r\n\r\n**To do tasks (High priority):**\r\n- [x] Investigate the implementation of `kotsu` into `sktime` - refer to Issue #2804\r\n- [x] Investigate implementation of `OpenML` into sktime - refer to Issue #2821\r\n- [x] Investigate implementaition of  `Mlflow` into sktime - refer to Issue #2916 \r\n- [x] Compare available benchmarking approaches\r\n- [ ] Converter for Multiindex DF into ListDataset -- refer to Issue #2860 \r\n- [ ] Converter for ListDataset into Multiindex DF\r\n\r\nUpdate: 6/20/2022\r\n- [x] kotsu's experiment: Test all estimators for point forecasting\r\n- [x]  kotsu's experiment: Test all estimators for interval forecasting\r\n- [ ] kotsu's experiment: Investigate Issue #2742\r\n- [ ] Prep M4 dataset for sktime\r\n- [ ] Mock a benchmarking study with vanilla kotsu\r\n- [ ] kotsu's experiment: Draft interface design for kotsu\r\n- [ ] kotsu's experiment: Try with annotations\r\n\r\n\r\n**Good to have (Lower priority):**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional thoughts (Not action item)**\r\nIf implemented,  the `gluonts`'s adapter would look similar to statsmodel's adapter.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2777/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6797356526,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc5LoKbizwAAAAGVJ23u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6797356526","actor":{"login":"TNTran92","id":55965636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTY1NjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92","html_url":"https://github.com/TNTran92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-13T15:57:04Z","rename":{"from":"[ENH] Apply Kotsu to sktime","to":"[ENH] Using Kotsu as a benchmarking framework - Implementation in sktime"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1154098951","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2804#issuecomment-1154098951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2804","id":1154098951,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5EyicH","user":{"login":"TNTran92","id":55965636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTY1NjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92","html_url":"https://github.com/TNTran92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-13T15:58:11Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T15:58:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> suggestion: let´s be more specific about what \"apply\" means.

the first 3 sections of the PR message Dan added for us, the rest are from sktime's PR message template.)\r\n \r\n#### Usage instructions:\r\n- See the reference issues below for getting context\r\n- See https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/developer_guide.html#developer-guide to set up sktime dev env (I used pyenv, made a venv, `pip install -e .[dev]`, `pip install pre-commit`, `pre-commit install`).\r\n- Dependencies to install specific for this PR: `autoreload`, `kotsu`, `jupyter`, `typing_extensions`\r\n- Try running the `sktime/benchmarking/run.ipynb`\r\n\r\n#### To do / decide now : \r\n- [x] @alex-hh @ali-tny review and share thoughts on implementation etc.\r\n- [x] Dan was getting a break from `kotsu` with `typing_extension module not found` error as we import `Literal` from that in `kotsu` - I \"fixed\" it by `pip install typing_extensions` in my sktime venv. I think this might be an issue in `kotsu` as we didn't include `typing_extensions` in its requirements?! Weird that it doesn't break in `kotsu` CI. \r\n- [x] Should we use a separate file for where define the main validation funcs and another file for registering them?\r\n- [x] What should be unit tested, and what should be considered like \"benchmarking infra\"?\r\n    - [x] Write those unit tests. \r\n\r\n#### To discuss with sktime team Tuesday 28th: \r\n- [ ] What [type of dependency](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/developer_guide/dependencies.html#types-of-dependencies) will `kotsu` be? (Dan thinks `soft`.) \r\n- [ ] What interface wanted for running the benchmarking? A python script? A jupyter notebook? \r\n- [ ] Register estimators in estimator modules or in benchmarking module? (Dan thinks within benchmarking.)\r\n- [ ] Saving copies of the folds? Saving estimator predictions? Or just save end scores. \r\n- [ ] Do we want to implement visualisations/explorations/further analysis? In benchmarking there's some analysis (e.g. t-tests etc.) modules. Or just store the base benchmark results and let people do analysis on those as they see fit?\r\n- [ ] We're trying to write as little code as pos and rely on sktime functionality as possible. `evaluate` only takes a single `scorer` - we would want to avoid running most training and pred for every scoring metrics. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing a pull request!

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImplement benchmarking using `kotsu`. \r\n- Instantiation of a `validation_registry` and `estimator_registry` in `benchmarking`'s `init`\r\n- A `validations.py` module which defines and registers validation runs.\r\n- An 'estimators.py' module which imports and registers estimators + their configs (i.e. param specifications)\r\n- A `run.py` module and/or a `run.ipynb` which runs the registry of estimators  \r\n\r\nLikely we will eventually want to have separate registries corresponding to different types of predictions (classification, regression, etc.), for now this just implements for regression (point prediction). \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.

The module registers an example specification.\r\n- An `estimators.py` module which imports and registers estimators + their configs (i.e. param specifications)\r\n- A `run.ipynb` which runs the registry of estimators through the validations, storing the benchmark results\r\n\r\nLikely we will eventually want to have separate registries corresponding to different types of predictions (classification, regression, etc.), for now this just implements for regression (point prediction).  \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n- `kotsu` - soft dependency\r\n- TBC: `jupyter` - soft dependency - depending on discussions outcome\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThe understandability, flexibility, extendability, and maintainability, of this benchmarking system implementation.\r\n\r\n#### To discuss at Tuesday 28th June meeting:\r\n(\"we\" refers to @DBCerigo @alex-hh @ali-tny) \r\n- [x] What [type of dependency](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/developer_guide/dependencies.html#types-of-dependencies) will `kotsu` be? We think `soft`.\r\n    - Answer: TBD, but maybe a core dep given benchmarking is intended to be a core functionality. \r\n- [x] What interface wanted for running the benchmarking? We implemented a jupyter notebook.\r\n    - Answer: Likely jupyter notebook yes. Should put it in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/examples\r\n- [x] How much is the `benchmarking` module intended to \"enable an `sktime` user to do the benchmarking they want to do\" vs \"do benchmarking of all `sktime` estimators and have the results for anyone to see\"?\r\n    - Answer: Primarily the former. \r\n- [x] Should we register estimators in estimator modules or in benchmarking module? We think within benchmarking.\r\n    - Answer: In benchmarking module/not even at all, and just let users register on the models they want to, in a notebook.\r\n- [x] When we use kotsu, we often store copies of the folds, copies of the predictions on the training folds and predictions on the test folds - this enables one to read the predictions for an estimator easily to do deep-dive/comparison analysis. Would this be wanted in `sktime` benchmarking?\r\n    - Answer: Yep, probably want this. \r\n- [x] Should we implement visualisations/explorations/further analysis? In benchmarking there's some analysis (e.g. t-tests etc.) modules. Or should `sktime` just store the base benchmark results and let users do analysis on those as they see fit?\r\n    - Answer: Maybe add at least 1 basic plot/analysis in the example notebook. \r\n- [x] We're trying to write as little code as possible and rely on sktime functionality as much as possible . \r\n    - [x] `evaluate` only takes a single `scorer` - we would want to avoid re-running training and predictions for every scoring metric as occurs in this PR. We could extend `evaluate` to take a list of scorers?\r\n        - Answer: Probably resolved when implementing storing fold data + predictions.  \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n#### PR

looked into `kotsu` and the draft PR https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2977 .\r\n\r\nI think overall it is great, in simplifying functionality!\r\n\r\nOne design point that bothers me, though, is the `kotsu` design which separates so-called \"entry points\" (factories or generators) from their kwargs, which in the case of `sktime` would mean separating classes from their hyper-parameter settings (objects cannot be passed, since the factories are called with the kwargs, and objects in general do not have a `__call__` defined).\r\n\r\nThat is design inconsistent with `sktime` (and `sklearn`) where objects are used as \"blueprints\", especially composites.\r\nClasses, in isolation, cannot specify runtime composites.\r\n\r\nDo I understand this correctly?\r\n\r\nSo, we may need to think how we can best deal with objects being used as \"blueprints\", along the lines of the `sklearn` design.\r\n\r\nOf course you could hack it, by splitting the object into its class , used as entry point, and extracting kwargs by `get_params(deep=False)`, but that seems like an interface patch rather than a principled approach.\r\n\r\nAnother way might be to invoke `kotsu` - or, rewrite `kotsu`, if not currently possible - that objects can be passed directly as entry points, i.e., the result of a current `entry_point(**kwargs)` rather than separately passing `entry_point` and

Explain your changes.\r\nThis PR provides a candidate benchmarking interface for sktime estimators/datasets by wrapping kotsu.\r\nCurrently only supports forecasters, but is intended to be flexible.\r\nIt is intended to allow users to create their own benchmarks by adding sets of estimators and tasks.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nkotsu\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n* To avoid sktime users interacting directly with kotsu, we interface kotsu via Benchmark objects designed to handle sktime objects\r\n* Currently the only output allowed is a df / csv file, however it might be desirable to provide simple ways to save models / predictions etc., by passing appropriate arguments to kotsu's benchmarking\r\n* Only a forecasting benchmark and a base benchmark are currently implemented. The idea is that other types of modelling problem could extend the base benchmark in similar ways however it wasn't clear to me how best to do this and  there may be other suggestions!\r\n* No tests are implemented currently\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.

As such pitfalls cause a critical failure to any fair benchmarking attempt and are hard to identify, kotsu tries to do what it can to avoid such occurrences, hence the interface demands a constructor/entry point which returns a fresh instance of an estimator.\r\n\r\n**Our suggested solution**, which we think gets the best of both scenarios is to pass estimator's `clone` functions as the entry point. This will(/should) ensure that every time the estimator is used in validation, it is a fresh instance, while still allowing users of the benchmarking module to register an estimator instance in a convenient way. We would still advise users to write factories for the models once they know they want that model to be a benchmarking example/candidate. Usage of the `kwargs` arg is optional - we often wrap are best competing model into their own factory function which includes their parameters hardcoded within the function, that way when we want to use it in production we can't get any of the winning model's config incorrect.\r\n\r\nI think this might indicate a possibly deeper difference in the way we are thinking about benchmarking - do correct me if I'm mistaken in any/all of this - namely that we're thinking about benchmarking as a _repeatable set of experiments and their records_, and on the other side there's thinking about benchmarking as an interactive explorative process (i.e. in an interactive python/jupyter session). This could be exemplified by a) the request to have benchmarking results returned directly as an in memory dataframe vs persisting the results to disk, and b) wanting to pass estimator instances possibly created within an interactive session vs wanting to pass estimator factories/constructors/entry_points that are written and organised into modules. Does any of this sound likely/reasonable?\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration against registering estimator instances (vs a factory or constructor for that estimator), which is likely the reason gym.env wrote the interface in this way originally, which is that with increasing in size estimators and increasing in number estimators one wants to benchmark one has an increasing amount of objects hanging around in memory. This is likely fine for more classic estimators, but for instance the recent push towards implementing deep learning models in sktime - I would be concerned about registering many differing instances of such models given the memory requirements of such large models. We're using kotsu for benchmarking models in the bioinformatics space and we couldn't/wouldn't want to load multiple versions of such models at once on our compute cluster.

ok, let me try to answer to your long comment.\r\nAhead of everything, I want to say that things are quite subtle, and I think *at the same time* that:\r\n\r\n* benchmarking should be repeatable, reproducible (i.e., there is no \"deeper difference in how we think about benchmarking\"!)\r\n* we should be able to pass initialized objects, not classes\r\n* there is no contradiction between the two (I feel you think there is a contradiction here)\r\n\r\nThe subtlety comes from separating concepts and how they are linked to the common sklearn-like designs.\r\nWe should separate three concepts and their python counterparts, as they commonly appear in those designs:\r\n\r\n(a) an abstract specification/blueprint, of an algorithm/estimator, and named parameters that can be set (without values set)\r\n(b) an abstract specification/blueprint, of an algorithm/estimator as in (a), plus specific values chosen for named parameters\r\n(c) a concrete algorithm/estimator which has ingested data and has an internal model state, after specification as in (b)\r\n\r\nIf I may try to rephrase your concern: you are saying that (c) is not good to have as input to benchmarking, since it can carry state and leakage. I fully agree to that. You further conclude that, therefore, we shouhld not have objects as inputs. I disagree with that. Reason being how (a) to (c) map onto python objects, as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) = sklearn type class\r\n(b) = sklearn type object, post-init, with parameters set, but not in \"fitted\" state\r\n(c) = sklearn type object, in \"fitted\" state\r\n\r\nSo, the possibly confusing thing is that sklearn objects may represent a \"pure specification\" (b), but also a highly stateful object (c). What separates \"specification\" from \"stateful\" is not the class/object boundary, but the fitted/unfitted boundary.\r\n\r\nSpecifications are fine, and desired as input to benchmarking, as conceptually they are the medium of reproducibility and repelicability. So, (a) and (b) are fine and desired. (c) is not.\r\n\r\nComing back to the argumentation: I think you missed that, conceptually, the (b) type objects are \"specification-like\", and were thinking that all objects (as opposed to classes) were \"non-specification-like\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1193385621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
