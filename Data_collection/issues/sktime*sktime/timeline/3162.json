This benchmark dataset proves that the current `StatsModels`' ETS implementation is not robust, challenging its purpose as a baseline model.

ensure you follow best academic citation practice in your academic papers, e.g., the accompanying paper here:\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03517\r\n\r\nI'm aware that in industry it might not be common or expected to comment on prior art (or even considered counterproductive for marketing reasons), and that Nixtla is primarily a commercial venture. But, since you are publishing in the arXiv you are at least making the claim of adhering to basic scientific standards, so I think you should at least give it a try.\r\n\r\nA proper \"literature review\" or \"prior art\" section is the minimum in any scientific paper, and that means commenting on the specific context of your contribution, not just providing a generic list of packages in an appendix.\r\n\r\nAs past contributors to `sktime`, you are probably aware of its hierarchical framework functionality, and the fact that the algorithms you present are also implemented there. See, e.g., this conference presentation from April:\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/sktime-tutorial-pydata-berlin-2022\r\n\r\nPerhaps more important even are the earlier python packages when it comes to hierarchical forecasting, which have developed pertinent designs, and which you don't even cite, e.g.,:\r\nhttps://github.com/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts, FYI @carlomazzaferro\r\nhttps://github.com/AngelPone/pyhts, FYI @angelpone\r\n\r\nAnd there is, of course, even more in R.\r\n\r\nYou can't claim to be a \"reference\" (in the title of your paper!) without making reference to what has come before. Pun intended.\r\n\r\nFrom your mission statement: \"We intend to continue maintaining and increasing the repository, *promoting collaboration across the forecasting community*.\"\r\n\r\nI do hope to see that, giving due credit in your scientific papers would be a good start.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions on best scientific practice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nixtla/hierarchicalforecast/issues/30/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nixtla/hierarchicalforecast/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1305430575","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3162#issuecomment-1305430575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3162","id":1305430575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Nz0ov","user":{"login":"topher-lo","id":46541035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46541035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/topher-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T10:55:14Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T10:56:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI: A PR has been created in `statsmodels` that enables multiple optimizers (including Nelder-Mead) for ETS https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/pull/8486","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1305430575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"topher-lo","id":46541035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46541035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/topher-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
