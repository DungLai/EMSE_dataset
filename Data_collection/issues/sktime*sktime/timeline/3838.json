apologies, did not see this - we expect code like this usually as a draft PR, not in an issue.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, looks excellent!\r\n\r\nTo answer your question: I would put it into `sktime.forecasting.compose._fallback`.\r\n\r\nPlease also ensure that:\r\n\r\n* linting runs, so when we trigger the remote CI it won't break at first step - speeds up the review and merge!\r\n* you ran `check_estimator` on this\r\n* you add the new estimator in an appropriate location in the API doc `docs.source.api_reference.forecasting`, I would suggest the end of the \"composition\" section.\r\n\r\n😄 \r\n\r\nAlso comment: fitted parameters should all end in an underscore, i.e., `last_exception_`, or it will not be seen by the default `get_fitted_params`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1336133132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7945985225,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5XVNpXzwAAAAHZnhzJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7945985225","actor":{"login":"RikStarmans","id":109525630,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoc6fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109525630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans","html_url":"https://github.com/RikStarmans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-03T10:47:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7945985228,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5XVNpXzwAAAAHZnhzM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7945985228","actor":{"login":"RikStarmans","id":109525630,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoc6fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109525630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans","html_url":"https://github.com/RikStarmans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-03T10:47:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
