Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #607 \r\n\r\nRelates to #723 #748 (@freddyaboulton FYI)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nI see sktime [was uploading a source tarball in v0.4.3](https://pypi.org/project/sktime/0.4.3/#files) and prior, but [has not done so since that version](https://pypi.org/project/sktime/0.5.3/#files).\r\n\r\nAs a result, running `pip install sktime` on platforms for which sktime has not built a wheel (like mac OS 10.14) will install that older version of sktime, v0.4.3.\r\n\r\nUploading a source tarball to PyPI will enable `pip`-installation of future sktime releases on platforms for which sktime didn't upload a wheel.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNope!\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nCheck out [the console output from the last run of the PyPI upload action](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/runs/1844683304?check_suite_focus=true) (for the v0.5.3 release). You can see it ran `python setup.py sdist` meaning it created a source tarball, but that tarball was simply never uploaded to PyPI.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nI also suggest the project owners (@mloning ) manually upload a source tarball for the last version (v0.5.3), to allow users of more platforms to install the latest package version without having to wait for the next release. I believe this would do it, from looking at [the twine docs](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):\r\n```bash\r\ngit checkout v0.5.3\r\npython3 setup.py sdist\r\ntwine upload dist/sktime-0.5.3.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/749/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/749/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/806258599","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/607#issuecomment-806258599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/607","id":806258599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNjI1ODU5OQ==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T23:57:20Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T23:57:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I've manually uploaded the tarball for the latest release (v0.5.3), you can find it [here](https://pypi.org/project/sktime/0.5.3/#files).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why it is so big though (36 MB), @dsherry any idea?
