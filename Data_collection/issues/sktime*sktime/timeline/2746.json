Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nFirst contribution to get a feel of the pull request process. Applied minor text changes - upper-case in section headers and at the start of bullet points - to 01_forecasting.ipynb and 01a_forecasting_sklearn.ipynb and added an image displaying the difference between supervised regression and forecasting.
