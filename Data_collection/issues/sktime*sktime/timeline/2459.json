I've added existing instances of dunders in the top post, for context \r\n\r\nThanks! Seeing the example related to the `*` operator overload for `TransformedTargetForecaster` makes it much clearer what you had in mind.\r\n\r\nSo - I share your concerns that having both `*` and `**` and having to think about the complexity of using `ForecastingPipeline` vs `TransformedTargetForecaster` might be confusing.  I know for myself at least I would end up having to remind myself which operator corresponded to which class every time I thought about using it, and thus either wouldn't use this shortcut, or it wouldn't end up saving me much time.  And I think that once you add in the fact that `ForecastingPipeline` can optionally take a `TransformedTargetForecaster` as a `Forecaster` you end up with a lot of complexity... and potentially the optionality to write hard to read/understand code chunks like `trans_X_1**trans_X_2**trans_y_1*trans_y_2*forecaster`.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps there is a way to reframe this problem so we abstract some of the complexity away from the user?  What are your thoughts on the following potential solution:\r\n\r\n- since it seems like a lot of this complexity is springing up from the fact that we must keep track of whether a particular transformer should be applied to `X` or `y` my idea was to add a new property, lets call it `apply_transform_to` to the `Transformer` classes that kept track of whether that particular instance of the transformer object was intended for transforming `X` or `y` inputs? \r\n-  this `apply_transform_to` property could be configured to not change any of the pre-existing actions of the transformer, so as to hopefully not interfere with any pre-existing code or assumptions  🤞 . (and could have a sensible default, ie `either` or `X` or `y` depending on the `Transformer` in question.  This property could then optionally be set by the user at the time of creation of a new `Transformer` object or left at the deafult). \r\n- in addition we also create a new `Pipeline` class, lets call it `StackAllTransformsAndForecast` (feel free to suggest a better name haha) which has 2 `steps` properties: `steps_y` and `steps_X`. \r\n-  when a new `StackAllTransformsAndForecast` object is created the `__init__()` could then handle checking the `apply_transform_to` property for all transforms it was handed in the steps and adding them to either `step_X` or `step_y` (or complaining if the `apply_transform_to` property is not specified).  \r\n- Note we could also easily extend this to accept pre-existing `TransformedTargetForecaster` or `ForecastingPipeline` objects as input as it would be easy to make sense of where the transformations associated with those object should go.\r\n- lastly - we simply have the `*` operator handle create a `StackAllTransformsAndForecast` object, and simply require that transformers using the `*` operator have the `apply_transform_to` property set.\r\n- now the user only has to keep in mind one special operator!\r\n- and can create pipeline objects like so: `pipe = trans_1.apply_transform_to('X')*trans_2.apply_transform_to('X')*trans_3.apply_transform_to('y')*forecaster` which in my mind is more readable. \r\n\r\nObviously some more details to hammer out on exactly how this might work, but curious on your thoughts/first impressions!\r\n\r\nOne issue with this is it could break pre-existing assumptions about the `*` operator creating a `TransformedTargetForecaster` object.  Personally I think it would be nice if the `*` was what we used for this as it just reads better - but perhaps you might have a sense of how long this feature has been around for/what it might break if we changed it. We could always default to your original suggestion of using `**` if needed. \r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that if properly implemented `StackAllTransformsAndForecast` could in theory replace `TransformedTargetForecaster` and `ForecastingPipeline`.  Obviously we would keep the other two around, but could recommend that new users use the unified pipeline?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1100216527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1100255036","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2459#issuecomment-1100255036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2459","id":1100255036,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5BlI88","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-15T17:40:13Z","updated_at":"2022-04-15T17:40:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> So - I share your concerns that having both `*` and `**` and having to think about the complexity of using `ForecastingPipeline` vs `TransformedTargetForecaster` might be confusing.\r\n\r\nYes, exactly - that's why I have so far been holding off with the second operator.\r\nCognitive overload is a real danger here.\r\n\r\nTo give the things on the other side of the argument:\r\n* Intuitively, you could think of `*` as \"primary pipeline\", i.e., it always acts on the \"central data stream\", and `**` acts on the \"secondary data stream\" if there is one.

My first impulse was, this is maybe not a good idea. \r\nMy second thought, looking at the final bullet point with the syntax: I think there's something interesting to it - perhaps attaching \"apply_to\" to the transformer is not exactly how to implement it, but perhaps there's sth similar.\r\n\r\nWhy I think this is maybe not a good idea: because this would violate the design principle of making specification of \"how applied\" extrinsic to the object. Phrased differently, what data a transformer is being applied to is not a \"natural property\" of the transformer, so shouldn't be attached to it.\r\nI know that attaching the data or properties of it to the estimator is tempting - but that kind of design invites a number of problems around \"mixing concerns\" imo.\r\n\r\nBut, it is a new idea - so I'll take some time to think it through, and see whether we can have sth similar, syntax-wise.\r\n\r\nQuestion: can you try to spell out why, in your mind, `.apply_transform_to('X')*` is more readable than `**`, why is `.apply_transform_to('y')*` more readable than `*`?\r\n\r\n> in addition we also create a new Pipeline class, lets call it StackAllTransformsAndForecast (feel free to suggest a better name haha) which has 2 steps properties: steps_y and steps_X.\r\n\r\nYes, I think this is a good idea!

To understand what you are trying to do here - would we essentially be trying to create a \"fake\" `X` variable via some transformation of the `y` variable?  Hmm, to me this seems potentially troublesome as it seems to clash a bit non-intuitively with my understanding of what \"exogenous\" data should be.  ie - now we have something that we are treating as an `X`, but really is just some transformed feature extracted from `y`.  Does that make sense? \r\n\r\nHowever, I can definitely understand that there are time when extracting multiple features from `y` can be very useful for prediction tasks (especially if we perhaps had some way of learning what features were helpful)!   So - I am not necessarily saying what you are trying to achieve here is necessarily a bad idea, just that at first glance the syntax of `steps_y_to_X` doesn't totally sit right. \r\n\r\n[edit - I was also a bit confused by what you meant by 'overwrite' here as well]","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1100300857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1100307444","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2459#issuecomment-1100307444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2459","id":1100307444,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5BlVv0","user":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-15T19:25:22Z","updated_at":"2022-04-15T19:26:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Just throwing this out there as a sort of half baked idea- but what if we somehow had pipeline building block classes?  ie - an x_transform_block and a y_transform block?
