PR changes `test_all_classifiers` to the test class architecture.\r\n\r\nThe main change is moving the tests into a class inheriting from `BaseFixtureGenerator` and `QuickTester`.\r\n\r\nChanges that deserve special note:\r\n* `test_3d_numpy_input` was removed - this is redundant with `test_methods_do_not_change_state` since that already runs the methods with 3D `numpy` input (using the scenario `ClassifierFitPredict`)\r\n* 100-times copy-pasted tests on unit test and basic motions data were moved to the test suite. This has been carried out for only two instances in this PR since it's tedious. Opened #2255 for doing the rest.\r\n* added multivariate scenario for classifiers. This allows to move the positive case from `test_multivariate_input`, because `test_all_estimators` covers that. Hence, now only the negative (exception raising) case is tested as `test_multivariate_input_exception`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6277165271,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5F_8H1zwAAAAF2JfDX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6277165271","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ffa7dca760b900cfc37b075f9d6cdf815b8fe354","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/ffa7dca760b900cfc37b075f9d6cdf815b8fe354","created_at":"2022-03-21T16:45:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6295555189,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5F_8H1zwAAAAF3Pox1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6295555189","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"84e7ba67af7a8086599d67c3fb5a3c704d57d05f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/84e7ba67af7a8086599d67c3fb5a3c704d57d05f","created_at":"2022-03-23T23:53:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1077603606","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2255#issuecomment-1077603606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2255","id":1077603606,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5AOu0W","user":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T13:02:04Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T13:02:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On
