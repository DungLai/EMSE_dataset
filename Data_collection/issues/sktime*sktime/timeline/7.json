commits with dummy transformers and additional tests have been added to demonstrate that the existing sklearn pipeline can be used with duck typing. Fortunately,\r\n1. Our dummy estimators and dummy transformers work properly with duck typing\r\n2. Both series to features and series to series transformers work properly as demonstrated by the new tests\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n1. Transforms can only be applied on X. To have transforms on y, we have to extend the existing pipeline functionality with appropriate distinction checks to separately process our transformers and pre-existing sklearn transformers. This is already done in the pipeline implementation of https://github.com/dmbee/seglearn (Another sklearn compatible module for time-series analysis). We can either use seglearn implementations or just adapt from it and avoid dependency.\r\n2. The column transformer available in sklearn that we discussed in the previous meeting is still experimental-level API and couldn't work with series to series transformations. However, this is still useful and we might possibly be able to extend this to support series-to-series transformers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/462415604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sajaysurya","id":25329624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzI5NjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25329624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya","html_url":"https://github.com/sajaysurya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajaysurya/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/462422966","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/7#issuecomment-462422966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/7","id":462422966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjQyMjk2Ng==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T17:43:23Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T17:43:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Regarding
