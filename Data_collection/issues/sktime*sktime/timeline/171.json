for raising the issue! We've been working on updating the benchmarking module, please take a look at the [`dev`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/dev/sktime/benchmarking) branch. We're planning on pushing these updates to the master branch and making a new release some time soon. \r\n\r\nThe `run` method should definitively accept datasets rather than pandas data frames. I'm sure the documentation isn't great on `dev` either. If you're interested in contributing, take a look at issue #141 where we've collected a number of to-dos and open design questions.
