You're actually commenting on what higher-order algorithm `ForecastingGridSearchCV` should implement in your opinion, and a discrepancy between that and the status quo.\r\n* I agree we may want to carefully think about, and then document expected/contracted behaviour. There is lack of proper documentation of intended \"should\" here.\r\n* I'm not sure I agree with your \"should\" state here. This would lead to two different algorithms being implemented, depending on the specific implementation of the wrapped estimator, not just on the type.
