I've got a PR out there for this now so you can look at the actual implementation (see #945).\r\n\r\n@aiwalter I think the original idea with option number 2 was to make it easier to deal with the inverse transformation when predicting, I've actually implemented something along the lines of option number 1. \r\n\r\n@fkiraly I agree on it just being a differencer, I went that route and we can figure out how to deal with the difference in the inverse transformation in prediction vs. on the input data. Your right-on in terms of the iterative cumulative summing. \r\n\r\n@mloning and I had talked about in-sample vs. out-of-sample being made on the index of the time series passed to the inverse transform. I'd like to find a way to go that route, but I think there might be issues with in-sample predictions (negative forecast horizons). \r\n\r\nI'll post a note about that in #945 and the inverse transformation in
