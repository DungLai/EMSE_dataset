This import probably should not happen in estimators, and it seems the pipelines are the only non-test/utility case where it is imported. This can be easily fixed.\r\n* there is the more general question whether we want to couple the `registry` module to all the base classes in this way - perhaps not? I think that's the main problem rather than where the base classes live, at least it is a possible way to address the issue - change the import logic in `registry`, for instance, rather than moving all the base classes
