the original reason ClusterMixin exists is the early sktime version of the Clustering module I made closely mirrored Sklearns where they have the following as their ClusterMixin\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ClusterMixin:\r\n    \"\"\"Mixin class for all cluster estimators in scikit-learn.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    _estimator_type = \"clusterer\"\r\n\r\n    def fit_predict(self, X, y=None):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Perform clustering on `X` and returns cluster labels.\r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)\r\n            Input data.\r\n        y : Ignored\r\n            Not used, present for API consistency by convention.\r\n        Returns\r\n        -------\r\n        labels : ndarray of shape (n_samples,), dtype=np.int64\r\n            Cluster labels.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        # non-optimized default implementation; override when a better\r\n        # method is possible for a given clustering algorithm\r\n        self.fit(X)\r\n        return self.labels_\r\n\r\n    def _more_tags(self):\r\n        return {\"preserves_dtype\": []}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then their clustering algorithms inherit ClusterMixin and BaseEstimator like so\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass DBSCAN(ClusterMixin, BaseEstimator):\r\n    \"\"\"Perform DBSCAN clustering from vector array or distance matrix.\r\n    DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.\r\n    Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them.\r\n... etc.\r\n```\r\nNow I am more familiar with Sktimes apporach I agree this mixin is redundent as we inherit BaseEstimator in our Base class (i.e. BaseClusterer, BaseClassifier, BaseForecaster etc.) which as you say does everything the Mixin does. Ill remove this in the next PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/869216657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisholder","id":4674372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4674372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisholder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/869234870","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1065#issuecomment-869234870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1065","id":869234870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTIzNDg3MA==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-27T22:51:38Z","updated_at":"2021-06-27T22:51:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">Now I am more familiar with Sktimes apporach I agree this mixin is redundent as we inherit BaseEstimator in our Base class (i.e. BaseClusterer, BaseClassifier, BaseForecaster etc.) which as you say does everything the Mixin does.
