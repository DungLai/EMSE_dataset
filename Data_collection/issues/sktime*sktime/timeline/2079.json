thanks for looking into this!\r\n\r\nI like the third option you propose. We can add a “skip_if_py310” marker that will automatically skip (or xfail) a test if it’s running in python 3.10 and use that to mark the prophet tests. pmdarima will support 3.10 in the next release so we can use the same marker to skip those tests until then. \r\n\r\nI like that because prophet is not a required dependency so I don’t think it should block our progress.  The prophet team is experimenting with pre-built wheels, so hopefully we won’t have to worry about compiling pystan in our ci long-term.

Might take a little bit of tinkering with the soft dependency utility, but surely soft dependencies should not prevent us from supporting python 3.10? That´s also not sustainable in the limit of infinite soft dependencies.

I.e., estimators, many of which interface to other libraries. Those libraries have python version bounds. So it seems natural to attach that property to an estimator.\r\n\r\nNote, in my conceptual model I do not consider an estimator to be an algorithm in its abstract, ideal form. I consider it an algorithm in a specific implementation. E.g., ARIMA from statsmodels is a different estimator from ARIMA from statsforecast. Similar to how you have different implementations of linear regression, while the \"ideal\" form is the same.\r\n\r\nAs python version compatibility is a property of the implementation, and my conceptual model refers to to an implementation, I think that it is very natural.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1132299332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1132300619","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2079#issuecomment-1132300619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2079","id":1132300619,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5DfYlL","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-19T23:36:53Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T23:36:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Another, more practical argument for my viewpoint: in the \"ideal limit\", the number of algorithms following the sktime interface (though, not necessarily in sktime itself), or more generally, a scikit-learn like interface, approaches infinity.\r\n\r\nIn this limit, the individual libraries interfaces will be arbitrarily behind the current python version, e.g., slow to update.
