Please describe.**\r\nI'd like to be able to install sktime with conda\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like a conda-forge feedstock to be created with a conda recipe to install sktime.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI know sktime can probably be pip installed into a conda environment... but it isn't ideal if you intend to update that environment continuously... pip and conda dependencies don't always play nice when updating.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nConda-forge has instructions for adding a [recipe](https://conda-forge.org/#add_recipe). I will try to assist if any developers are interested - I'm not clear on whether sktime can be deployed as a no specific architecture package or whether it needs special build steps for each platform.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/326/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/326/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-11T10:44:50Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T10:44:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/394","id":699157040,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDg0OTI4MDgw","number":394,"title":"Update

You can check our [package](https://github.com/LAMDA-NJU/Deep-Forest/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-wheels.yml) that uses cibuildwheel, it is quite convenient, and we can even build wheels for architectures like `aarch64`.\r\n\r\nI have checked all supported python versions and platforms of sktime on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sktime/#files), all of them can be built with cibuildwheel.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Another benefit is that we can have sktime listed on the homepage of [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel) as a way of advertisement
