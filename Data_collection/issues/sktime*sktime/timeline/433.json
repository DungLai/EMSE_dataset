Some are not defined with exogenous variables (e.g. exponential smoothing), others support it already (e.g. AutoARIMA), and for some we still need to implement it (e.g. reduction to regression). \r\n\r\nHere's an example with AutoARIMA: \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.all import * \r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\ny_train, y_test, X_train, X_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, X)\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)\r\n\r\nforecaster = AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True)\r\nforecaster.fit(y_train, X_train)\r\ny_pred = forecaster.predict(fh, X=X_test)\r\nplot_series(y_train, y_test, y_pred, labels=[\"y_train\", \"y_test\", \"y_pred\"])\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21020482/101983954-246f1800-3c76-11eb-8a73-28fb6bff525d.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/743749319/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4104111943,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEwNDExMTk0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4104111943","actor":{"login":"ShahNewazKhan","id":3241700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3241700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan","html_url":"https://github.com/ShahNewazKhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-12T12:33:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4104111945,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMDQxMTE5NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4104111945","actor":{"login":"ShahNewazKhan","id":3241700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3241700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan","html_url":"https://github.com/ShahNewazKhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShahNewazKhan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-12T12:33:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/743749471","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/433#issuecomment-743749471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/433","id":743749471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Mzc0OTQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-12T1
