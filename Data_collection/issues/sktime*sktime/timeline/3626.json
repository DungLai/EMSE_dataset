thanks for this. As Franz says, this is the default behaviour, and if there is no default for predict_proba other code expecting classifiers to have this function will break. This RocketClassifier is meant to statically capture the implementation described here https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-020-00701-z. If you want sensible probabilities, you can make your own rocket based classifier using a pipeline and a scikit learn classifier that does this.
