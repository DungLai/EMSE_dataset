It would be great to get this fixed! Here are my thoughts but I'm happy for you to take the lead.\r\n\r\nWe have a few options:\r\n1. replace our KNN with an interface to tslearn's KNN,\r\n2. fix our KNN using distances from the dtaidistance package,\r\n3. fix our KNN and distance functions.\r\n\r\n3 seems to involve most work. The dtaidistance package seems to be well maintained but I'm not sure how compatible it is with scikit-learn. tslearn also has its own distance implementations. It may be worth to compare their functions against ours and see if they have all the distances that we have. What do you
