A similar question: should univariate forecasters not automatically be applied this way too?\r\n\r\nyes I was thinking the same. but I think normally you would not apply the same hyperparameters to each column, right? So you would probably rather use a `ForecastingGirdSeachCV` in combination with a `ColumnsEnsembleForecaster` I guess. But we could have it anyway as a default. Its just the risk that users dont know about that they actually apply a univariate model, but thas also for transformers. So we should definitely mention it in docstring then. Also I wanted to add multivariate `NaiveForecaster`, but maybe I can directly add it to base class so it would work for all univariate?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/914364546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/914616494","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1393#issuecomment-914616494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1393","id":914616494,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc42g_Cu","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-07T20:42:24Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T20:42:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yes, that's an interesting point - there is potential syntatic ambiguity here, since it's unclear whether applying `ForecastingGridSearchCV` to a univariate forecaster would tune all columns simultaneously or not.
