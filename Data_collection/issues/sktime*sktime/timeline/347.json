But how will dataframes be handled?\r\n\r\nWell, if a given model can't handle it, it will/should/might throw an error, e.g., a `ValueError` \"this model cannot handle multivariate series :-(\" or similar. If it can, a vendor/external interface would convert it to the machine format the interfaced method likes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we also want to have some estimator tags on what inputs an implemented methods can handle, similar to the experimental `sklearn` [estimator tags](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#estimator-tags).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/664606477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-09T15:41:46Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T15:41:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/392","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/392/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/392/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/392/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/392","id":696923402,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDgyOTM1MjEx","number":392,"title":"Add

Reference Issues/PRs\r\n#347, #220\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n* Support for `pd.DatetimeIndex`, `pd.PeriodIndex` in data and forecasting horizon, including helper functions to patch mathematical operations on pandas date/time objects for our purposes (mostly returning integers for known time unit, rather than time delta objects)\r\n* Included forecasting data sets are now returned with `pd.PeriodIndex`\r\n* Support for absolute forecasting horizon specification via refactored `ForecastingHorizon` class\r\n* Easy importing via `sktime.forecasting.all` module enabling `from sktime.forecasting.all import *` following [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/)\r\n* A few minor changes (typos, formatting, etc)\r\n* Corresponding updates to forecasting notebook\r\n* New unit tests for supported combinations of data index types and forecasting types\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n* seaborn (soft dependency, for plotting) \r\n\r\n#### Key files to review \r\nSince the forecasting horizon was used in basically every forecasting algorithm, this PR makes changes to many files. Key changes include:\r\n\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/base/_fh.py` (implementation of forecasting horizon class)\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/base/tests/test_fh.py` (unit tests for forecasting horizon class)\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/tests/_config.py` (check SUPPORTED_INDEX_FH_COMBINATIONS)\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/tests/test_all_forecasters.py` (unit testing framework for all forecasters)\r\n* `sktime/utils/datetime.py` (date/time helper functions)\r\n\r\n#### Comments\r\n* Supporting only `pd.PeriodIndex` and not `pd.DatetimeIndex` would make the code a bit simpler as `pd.DatetimeIndex` requires additional patches to return integers for durations/time deltas and additional type distinctions (dispatch), however it seems like `pd.DatetimeIndex` supports some functionality which is not supported by `pd.PeriodIndex` (e.g. `is_month_end`)\r\n\r\n#### Future work\r\n* refactor `BaseLastWindowForecaster` and reduce inheritance as much as possible","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/705240441","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/347#issuecomment-705240441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/347","id":705240441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTI0MDQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-07T23:11:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T23:11:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closed by #392 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/705240441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3852850102,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg1Mjg1MDEwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3852850102","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-07T23:11:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
