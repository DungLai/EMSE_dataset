refactoring adjustments for the `make_reduction` changes\r\n\r\nMain point is to remove the rather clumsy checks date checks\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            if isinstance(self.cutoff, pd._libs.tslibs.period.Period):\r\n                dateline = pd.period_range(\r\n                    end=fh.to_absolute(self.cutoff)[-1], periods=fh_max\r\n                )\r\n            elif isinstance(self.cutoff, np.int64) or isinstance(self.cutoff, int):\r\n                dateline = list(\r\n                    range(self.cutoff + 1, fh.to_absolute(self.cutoff)[-1] + 1)\r\n                )\r\n            else:\r\n                dateline = pd.date_range(\r\n                    end=fh.to_absolute(self.cutoff)[-1], periods=fh_max\r\n                )\r\n            y_pred = _create_multiindex(dateline, self._y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a helper function that draws on the fh functions\r\n\r\n```python\r\n index_range = _index_range(relative, self.cutoff)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso reworked the `create_multiindex` function to for compatibility with hierarchical formats.\r\n\r\nThe key step is \r\n\r\n```\r\n    mi = (\r\n        target_frame.groupby(x_names, as_index=True)\r\n        .apply(\r\n            lambda df: df.drop(x_names, axis=1)\r\n            .set_index(time_names)\r\n            .asfreq(freq_inferred)\r\n        )\r\n        .index\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat supports now to have the hierarchical format also for global forecasting\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2628\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2615","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7157199223,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5Jgld-zwAAAAGqmjF3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7157199223","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"563282e64196aba559e212f03651b54bd7b56dac","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/563282e64196aba559e212f03651b54bd7b56dac","created_at":"2022-08-09T16:45:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
