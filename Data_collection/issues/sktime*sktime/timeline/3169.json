The class labels for each case in X.\r\n        If return_X_y is False, y is appended to X.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would suggest a slightly modified version of your solution 1:\r\n* in `_load_provided_dataset`, call `load_from_tsfile` with the default `return_type=\"nested_univ\"` first. This allows to delay any conversions to `_load_provided_dataset`\r\n* in `_load_provided_dataset`, then deal with the `\"nested_univ\"` type only. At the end, before you return `X`, do the conversion using `convert`, just like currently in `load_from_tsfile`\r\n* make sure the docstrings are up-to-date and in consistent format everywhere: in `_load_provided_dataset`, and also in `load_UCR_UEA_dataset` (which, after this operation, will be able to return more formats).

I was looking through the `datatypes/` directory since these failures are results of how different datatypes are defined.

I manually tried these combinations and all but the last three work (in terms of loading data into `X,y`/`X`). \r\n- The last three errors are consistent in manual checks too. This has to do with the fact that conversions are taking place under different assumptions that what they were originally designed in `*/_convert.py` functions. Originally, these conversions do not consider response variable to be attached to predictors.\r\n\r\nI've created a [draft pull request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3231) for you to check out all the codes

thanks for tracking down the bug!!!\r\n\r\nI have fixed the instances I could find, in here.\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3245\r\n\r\nVexing that these were not caught by tests, but I suppose it would have needed very speific fixtures inside negative tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1212519200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7175116571,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5PKMEWzwAAAAGrq5cb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7175116571","actor":{"login":"achieveordie","id":54197164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTk3MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54197164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie","html_url":"https://github.com/achieveordie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-11T21:35:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7175116576,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5PKMEWzwAAAAGrq5cg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7175116576","actor":{"login":"achieveordie","id":54197164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTk3MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54197164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie","html_url":"https://github.com/achieveordie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-11T21:35:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1212520844","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3169#issuecomment-1212520844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3169","id":1212520844,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5IRZmM","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T21:37:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T21:37:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"PS,

The way current convert functions are defined does not account for the fact that the `class_val` column cannot be used with `.explode()` resulting in `Nan`s for this column which results in object types causing checks to fail. This can be seen while manually calling the set of functions that will otherwise be called by `.convert()`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nX = _load_provided_dataset(name, split='TRAIN', return_X_y=False, return_type=\"nested_univ\")\r\nX_convert = from_nested_to_multi_index_adp(X)\r\nprint(X_convert.head())\r\n\r\n# X has proper class_val values as expected.\r\n# Output\r\n#                       dim_0 class_val\r\n# instances timepoints\r\n# 0         0           573.0       NaN\r\n#           1           375.0       NaN\r\n#           2           301.0       NaN\r\n#           3           212.0       NaN\r\n#           4            55.0       NaN\r\n```\r\nOne can then look into `datatypes/_panel/_convert.py` to see that `from_nested_to_multi_index_adp()` makes use of `explode()` for every column it encounters. It is not made to deal with \"class_val\" which only has one values for series in other dimensions. \r\n\r\nI'm sure it can be easily corrected but since I'm not proficient in dealing with hierarchy, I can only try using ugly and inefficient list comprehension-like ways to fix it.
