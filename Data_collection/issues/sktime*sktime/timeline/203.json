However, for tasks like forecasting I see no reason why they should not also handle different data structures. So in Java I would use method overriding, fit(OurDS x) and fit(AnArray x), but obviously this doesnt work in a language without typing. Switching is needed internally. That's a developers problem, and open to debate.\r\n\r\nBut this begs the question, is the data structure also a problem for the user? For the user, my approach would be to encapsulate, so the user has no need to see the data structure. So we can load from long format or  our own .ts or arff etc and the nested pandas approach would not really be apparent. I dont think we have done enough to make this seemless, but I also realize now that this is not the standard use case for most python/data science people, who seem to like interactive/enhanced spreadsheet use more than the batch mode I tend to employ.    \r\n\r\nIt seems to me the data structure is most confusing for forecasting, where you usually start with a single series, and using an n x m matrix of series seems daft. One solution may be to use a different underlying core representation for forecasting and classification/regression, with easy methods for converting from one to another.  The reduction methods then just return an appropriate data structure. This if I want to reduce simple forecasting to regression, I take a single series argument and return a one column matrix of series, panel forecasting might return a multiple column matrix?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/560310950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2844905719,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyODQ0OTA1NzE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2844905719","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-02T09:30:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/560378093","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/203#issuecomment-560378093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/203","id":560378093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDM3ODA5Mw==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T12:35:55Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T12:35:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">One
