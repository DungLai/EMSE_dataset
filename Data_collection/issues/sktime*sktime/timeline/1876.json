It seems to be a more prevalent problem. I will try to list out specific issues.\r\n\r\n## For statsmodels\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be with `to_absolute_int` method of the ForecastingHorizon which is called from the adapter. At a 10 minute interval in PeriodIndex, it seems to be returning extremely large values for the integers.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/150614706-a215f5cd-bdc6-4b7c-9994-bceeb68c700a.png)\r\n\r\n## For PolynomialTrendForecaster\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be with the calculation of X.
