#2826\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nI have implemented a Window based change point detection algorithm in the form of an adapter for the ruptures Window class \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nThe contribution creates a new soft dependency as such, pyproject.toml and check_soft_dependencies.py have been updated as well.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nAs there is no template chosen yet for annotation/change point/segmentation I went ahead and chose what I thought was best and was to inherit from BaseSeriesAnnotator class. \r\nI can refactor any changes if needed or if any other template would be better I will make the changes.
