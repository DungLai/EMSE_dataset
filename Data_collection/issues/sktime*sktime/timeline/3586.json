PR loosens the upper version bound for `scipy` to `<2.0.0`, thus removing any restriction on `1.X.X` versions.\r\n\r\nWe had the MINOR bound introduced after repeated breakage, this was mostly on `sktime` side using private methods (which was a mistake). Afaik we are no longer doing that, and `scipy` is very good at deprecation, so I think we can safely move the bound up to the MAJOR cycle.\r\n\r\nFixes #3586.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7596934259,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5UD67FzwAAAAHE0ARz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7596934259","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-16T20:52:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7596934264,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5UD67FzwAAAAHE0AR4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7596934264","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5df4f610ee50185ae9996ba4eaf25ed10e372d39","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/5df4f610ee50185ae9996ba4eaf25ed10e372d39","created_at":"2022-10-16T20:52:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
