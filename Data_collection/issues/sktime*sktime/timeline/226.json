 This issue is about the multi-output strategy. Some models can directly predict multiple outputs, see e.g. LinearRegression:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\n\r\ny = np.random.normal(size=(10, 3))  # target has multiple columns\r\nX = np.random.normal(size=(10, 5))\r\n\r\nestimator = LinearRegression()\r\nestimator.fit(X, y)\r\ny_pred = estimator.predict(X)  # we predict multiple columns\r\nprint(y_pred.shape)\r\n>>> (10, 3)\r\n```\r\n \r\nWe need to enable the multi-output prediction strategy by adding a \"multioutput\" option to the \"strategy\" kwarg in the [`ReducedRegressionForecaster`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/sktime/forecasting/compose/_reduce.py).\r\n\r\nWe could check the estimator by checking if it inherits from scikit-learn's `MultiOutputMixin`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/786084125","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/226#issuecomment-786084125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/226","id":786084125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjA4NDEyNQ==","user":{"login":"luiszugasti","id":11198457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk4NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11198457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti","html_url":"https://github.com/luiszugasti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luiszugasti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T17:47:31Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T17:47:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mloning I'm looking into this.
