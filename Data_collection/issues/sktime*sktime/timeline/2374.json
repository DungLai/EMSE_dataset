the signature module was definitely working fine, but I appreciate some things have needed to be changed around.\r\n\r\nSo we always work with paths of shape [N, L, C] whereas sktime uses [N, C, L]. I took the lazy route of just flipping the C, L axes in the SignatureTransformer class and keeping everything the same as my existing stuff for the remainder of the code. I realise this makes the augmentation classes usable only via `SignatureTransformer` that handles the axes flipping. If it is desired for them to become general classes then they need adapting. \r\n\r\n`SignatureClassifier` is just a wrapper around `SignatureTransformer`. So they are not mixed up since `SignatureClassifier` just calls `SignatureTransformer` which flips the axes and performs the signature operations. Thus is does not need to happen in `SignatureClassifier`.\r\n\r\nOne option, which appears to be the one taken, would perform a transpose for each of the augmentations, but this must also happen in the `esig.stream2sig/stream2logsig` function - it appears not to have been added to the`esig` bits. \r\n\r\nI don't understand what this issue with depth is. The new code just seems to change the `depth` attribute to `sig_depth` but then call `depth = self.sig_depth` in the transform function. Not sure why this was necessary.

Feature dimension would scale exponentially with length which would be a disaster in general.\r\n\r\n`esig` expects paths of shape `[length, channels]`, so I'm pretty sure the change must be\r\n```\r\nsignature = np.stack(\r\n    [transform(x[:, window.start : window.end].T) for x in data]\r\n).reshape(data.shape[0], -1)\r\n```\r\nassuming data is shape `[batch, channels, length]` due to dimension flips at the start.\r\n\r\nHowever, @fkiraly has said this change did not pass the tests and reverted back to how it was before. Now I'm pretty sure it cant be what it was before and it must mean its a problem with my tests not picking this up, however I don't know why it fails with the suggested approach. I'd need to see the test error to understand why./\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1092855319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jambo6","id":32545677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTQ1Njc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32545677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6","html_url":"https://github.com/jambo6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6396442137,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5G-UojzwAAAAF9QfYZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6396442137","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-08T13:22:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
