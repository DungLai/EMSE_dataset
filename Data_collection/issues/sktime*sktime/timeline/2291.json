The latter has as default \"refitting on the entire data seen so far\".\r\n\r\nSo from a framework perspective, it seems that refitting/updating is hardcoded and also done as a default (if all works as intended).\r\n\r\nWhat could be the case, is that individual models override this incorrectly and don't update despite the interface looking like it would.\r\n\r\nSo, could you kindly paste some reproducible code, and let us know whether you think it's a particular model, or whether it's a general problem? If you think it's a general problem, can you explain why you think it

It's just weird that the behaviour of the transformer (/steps) changed over the bump and I couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nAre you saying, it changed in one of the recent versions?\r\n\r\nYou're right about how that would behave, assuming `_update` was added sometime recently.\r\nIf the `_update` wouldn't be there in the pipelines, it would just revert to default behaviour specified in the base class framework (`BaseForecaster`), and just continue updating by fitting to the entire data (without calling any implemented `update` functionality of the steps).\r\n\r\nThat's computationally more wasteful than calling `update`, but ... at least it's correct ...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I guess we're lucky that we found this 1 day before the new release. If this is indeed the fix, it should be included in the new, much improved 😄 0.11.0 version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1078042504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1078050602","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2291#issuecomment-1078050602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2291","id":1078050602,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5AQb8q","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T19:43:44Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T19:44:34Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> It would not explain why the updating runs in no time, but it would explain why the output is garbage.\r\n\r\nI'm noticing, my sentence above give an explanation to the \"no time\" aspect - calling `update` is usually much faster than a complete refit, so it fits the explanation:\r\n\r\nit's faster because `update` is being called now instead of a `fit` to the entire data, so it's faster.
