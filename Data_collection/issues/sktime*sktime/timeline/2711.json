there was a bug we fixed, where pipeline concatenation and automatic vectorization (across instances) were done in the wrong order, it should have been \"vectorize first, then concatenate\", but it actually happened the other way round, with whether vectorization happened determined by the first pipeline element.\r\n\r\nVectorizing the reconciler would make it trivial (a simple passthrough), potentially leading to the behaviour you describe.\r\n\r\nHence, you could help us by checking whether the problem still persists on current `main`, it could have already been fixed by

PR loosens checks related to index equality related tags:\r\n\r\n* if a forecaster has `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` and `\"ignores-exogeneous-X\"` tag both set to True, this will no longer result in an exception if `X` is passed and is not index compliant with `y`. Why: if `X` is ignored, then `X.index` should also not matter for anything, including checks.\r\n* In transformer and forecaster pipelines, the `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` tag is no longer copied from forecaster or conjunction-inferred from transformers. This was logically incorrect, as there are transformers that can add or remove indices. There have been actual instances of unexpected behaviour around this in pipelines. Example 1: `Aggregator` which adds indices https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2711; example 2: `Differencer` which removes indices https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2807, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2452\r\n(FYI @ngupta23, @anthonygiorgio97)\r\n* if a forecaster has `\"ignores-exogeneous-X\"`, then `X=None` is passed to the inner methods, instead of performing unnecessary conversions on `X` and passing the result to the inner methods. This is done after performing input checks on `X`, to let the user know early of non-conformant `X` - even if `X` is never used.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds two tests that ensure that the ablated examples from https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2711

entered vectorization mode and `y` was passed (and also vectorized), then the transformer would pass the vectorized `X` to the inner methods where a vectorized `y` should have passed, i.e., passing `X` as `X` (correctly), and `y` as `X` as well (incorrectly).

On the PR branch, both examples work as expected.\r\n\r\nFYI @ngupta23. Took a bit long to hunt this down,
