At a high level, it allows users to register a dataset with a validation task (CV splitter method) and then apply estimators to that registration. It will be beneficial to investigate its application to sktime's benchmarking.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nInput: estimator, dataset, cross validation splitter\r\nOutput: a Dataframe showing result per estimator per dataset\r\n*: In this notebook, the result is returned as a .csv saved to the same folder as the notebook\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've

We've tried to keep `kotsu` as light-weight as possible, but we have a few very common patterns we use whenever using `kotsu` with `sklearn` which we will likely add into `kotsu` in the future - happy to share them in advance if helpful. \r\n\r\nIf any questions arise do fire away and we'll answer them. \r\n\r\nWe would be game to contribute some of our time to doing a spike with `kotsu` to see if it will be a good fit for what you're trying to achieve if you'd like to point me in the direction of an example benchmark you're trying to implement.

I don't think he ever shared the code, though. I don't think I have access to it, for instance.\r\n* in 2019, @TonyBagnall also wanted to replicate his benchmarking studies from earlier papers, most prominently, the \"time series classification bake-off\". I think he never did that either, but there must be some code that his research group is using. I find it unlikely that we'll get access or that that moves into `sktime`. But being able to do sth similar would be a nice goal.\r\nSome historical discussion here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/12 it looks like the topic just got ghosted in the end.\r\n* the benchmarking module of `sktime`, which I think still works but has run out of sync a bit, design-wise https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/sktime/benchmarking. @ViktorKaz wanted to work on this but that also got abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn summary, it seems that benchmarking is a topic which seems at the same time hard design-wise, and a topic where people are either reluctant or unable to share or produce clean, reusable code.\r\nMaybe this is where `kotsu` (or openML etc) could help?\r\n\r\nThe \"application\" goals for me would be clear:\r\n\r\n* few-liner to run M4/M5 like benchmarks for forecasting\r\n* few-liner to run bake-off like benchmarks for classification\r\n\r\n(and it should be flexible to change the data sets used, the metrics used, the estimators

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nDemonstrate how OpenML's data format is incompatible with sktime.\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\n- In an OpenML dataset, each variable is in a column, each time point is a row, just like in a DataFrame.\r\n- Correction from daily stand-up: Not required to have `target` column but since OpenML does not support Pd.Series inside DataFrame => Need to turn time series into rolling-window format.\r\n- Because dataset has to be rolling window, adapters need to be made for .ts format, estimator, CV splitter and `metrics`\r\n- Still not sure how to make a 1:1 conversion of MultiIndex DataFrame to OpenML Dataset \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nYes, OpenML\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are.

Register them and \"hit\" `run`. \r\n\r\n> In summary, it seems that benchmarking is a topic which seems at the same time hard design-wise, and a topic where people are either reluctant or unable to share or produce clean, reusable code. Maybe this is where `kotsu` (or openML etc) could help?\r\n\r\nAgain, we built `kotsu` specifically to solve those problems of benchmarking often becoming a messy, bloated, and even inaccurate (unfair comparisons) endeavours. \r\n\r\n> (and it should be flexible to change the data sets used, the metrics used, the estimators used)\r\n\r\nYep it is designed for such flexibility. \r\n\r\n@TNTran92 \r\n> kotsu works straight out of the box - we do not have to worry about adapters and just on how to incorporate it into sktime\r\n\r\nGlad to hear that.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/TNTran92/sktime/blob/kotsu_application/sktime/benchmarking/kotsu_sktime_application.ipynb it looks like you already know what you're doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyself and co (@ali-tny @alex-hh) would be interested in contributing to/supporting on implementing such benchmarking. We use it for all our projects and so can offer our usual patterns/structure for using it in a clean and unobtrusive way. \r\n\r\nAre there any time constraints or aimed-for deadlines for this?
