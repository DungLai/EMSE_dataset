We reject candidate shapelets if they do not exceed the threshold, so if there are no shapelets in a dataset with an info gain higher than the threshold, the transform will finish fit with 0 accepted shapelets. Hopefully this should be rare (and I have never come across it!) but it could happen and thanks for catching the edge case.
