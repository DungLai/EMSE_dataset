discussed with @TonyBagnall, this PR upgrades the base classifier class refactor #1594 to use the existing checks and coercions in `datatypes` instead of the new, custom functions written by @TonyBagnall.\r\n\r\nIt is based on #1745 (merged) and #1748 (not yet merged), which in turn have some routines by @TonyBagnall from #1594 moved into the `datatypes` module (e.g., inferring the data characteristics for certain mtypes).\r\n\r\nNote: this is a PR into the other PR, not into `main`.\r\n\r\nA lot of files appear changed, that's because #1745 (merged in `main`) and #1748 (not merged in main) are not yet part of #1594. To see the \"real\" diffs (localized to `BaseClassifier` and small of size), #1748 needs to be merged with `main`, and #1594 needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nReviewers of this PR can hence focus exclusively on changes in `BaseClassifier` and the `base` module it is in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1749/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/999770792","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1756#issuecomment-999770792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1756","id":999770792,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc47l0qo","user":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-22T18:10:10Z","updated_at":"2021-12-22T18:10:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"so the problem here is not a bug, but an enhancement request.
