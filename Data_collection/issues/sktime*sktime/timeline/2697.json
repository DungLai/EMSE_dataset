discuss/refine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1159576346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1194996359","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2697#issuecomment-1194996359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2697","id":1194996359,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HOjKH","user":{"login":"achieveordie","id":54197164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTk3MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54197164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie","html_url":"https://github.com/achieveordie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-26T04:46:45Z","updated_at":"2022-07-26T04:46:45Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hello @fkiraly, I want to contribute to sktime and since this was marked as a \"good first issue\" and I'm a newcomer, I made a few changes in the structure. \r\n\r\n- In the `_data_io.py` file, I've refactored the private functions `_load_provided_dataset()` and `_load_dataset()` in a manner that `_load_dataset()` takes care extraction of data and then calls the former to load the provided data. This refactor reduces the boilerplate code of loading data from the given split.\r\n\r\n- My concern initially was the inconsistent use of `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe()` and `load_from_tsfile()` in both functions, so in the refactored version, I've only made use of `load_from_tsfile()` as the sole entrypoint since that seems to call `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe()` anyways and gives us more control over the datatype. \r\n\r\n- These changes also require the addition of a few default parameters into both functions, like having a parameter `return_type=None` in `_load_dataset()` and having parameters `local_module` and `local_dirname` in `_load_provided_dataset()`, with the default values as the global variable `MODULE` and `DIRNAME` respectively.\r\n\r\nI haven't read the specific file loader functions line by line, but to me, it seems like they shouldn't be refactored as they parse different formats differently, so I wanted to know your opinion on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1194996359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"achieveordie","id":54197164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTk3MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54197164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie","html_url":"https://github.com/achieveordie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7061587167,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5KYvGGzwAAAAGk50Tf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7061587167","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-26T04:46:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7061587171,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5KYvGGzwAAAAGk50Tj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7061587171","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-26T04:46:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1195466407","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2697#issuecomment-1195466407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2697","id":1195466407,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HQV6n","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-26T13:12:19Z","updated_at":"2022-07-26T13:12:19Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">Hello

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nAs per #2697, reduced some boilerplate code in the loader functions\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n- In the `_data_io.py` file,  Private functions `_load_provided_dataset()` and `_load_dataset()` were refactored in a manner that `_load_dataset()` takes care extraction of data and then calls the former to load the provided data.\r\n- Only use `load_from_tsfile()` as the sole entrypoint. Initially, both `load_from_tsfile()` and `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe()` were used in private functions mentioned above which is un-necessary since the former calls later anyways. This also gives more control over how data is to be returned.\r\n- Owing to above changes, three default parameters were introduced in both functions combined. Namely, `return_type=None` in `load_dataset()` and `local_module`, `local_dirname` in `_load_provided_dataset()` with the default values as the global variable `MODULE` and `DIRNAME` respectively.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNone\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nNone\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy.

the bug**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n-->\r\nAs per the discussion in #2697, it was [found](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2697#issuecomment-1196290311) that `_load_provided_dataset()` must throw an error if `return_type` is not a reference to `pd.DataFrame` and `return_X_y=False`. This happens because of code appends the response variable into predictors under the column name 'class_val'.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sktime\r\nfrom sktime.datasets._data_io import _load_provided_dataset\r\n\r\ndef test_load_provided_dataset():\r\n    name = \"UnitTest\"                                    # referencing to dataset available for testing in the directory 'datasets/data/'\r\n    X, y = _load_provided_dataset(name, return_type='np2D', return_X_y=False)\r\n    print(X.shape, y.shape)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    print(\"Staring program\")\r\n    test_load_provided_dataset()\r\n    print(\"Done\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of above code**\r\n```\r\nPS D:\\Projects\\sktime\\sktime\\sktime\\datasets\\tests> D:/Anaconda/envs/sktime-dev/python temp_test_data_io.py\r\nStaring program\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"temp_test_data_io.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    test_load_provided_dataset()\r\n  File \"temp_test_data_io.py\", line 6, in test_load_provided_dataset\r\n    X, y = _load_provided_dataset(name, return_type='np2D', return_X_y=False)\r\n  File \"d:\\projects\\sktime\\sktime\\sktime\\datasets\\_data_io.py\", line 224, in _load_provided_dataset\r\n    X[\"class_val\"] = pd.Series(y)\r\nIndexError: only integers, slices (`:`), ellipsis (`...`), numpy.newaxis (`None`) and integer or boolean arrays are valid indices\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nThis clearly is an issue because we are not checking the instance type of X, which could be `np.array` or `pd.DataFrame`.\r\n\r\n**Solutions(?)**\r\n* _Solution 1: Check instance and append in the appropriate axis_\r\n  Consider the following cases \r\n  - Univariate, 2D, equal length data (`X=np.random.randn(20, 24), y=np.random.randn(20,)`) then `output.shape=(20,25)`\r\n  - Univariate 3D, equal length data (`X=np.random.randn(20,1,24), y=np.random.randn(20,)`) then `output.shape=(20,1,25)`\r\n  - Multivariate, equal length data (`X=np.random.randn(20,6,24), y=np.random.randn(20,)`) then `output.shape=(20,6,25)`; requires tiling labels which might not be desirable.\r\n \r\n  I think it should also work for unequal length data but I need confirmation. The only drawback of this solution apart from the repetition of y in the multivariate case is that it might be less intuitive.\r\n\r\n* _Solution 2: Force convert the data into pandas dataframe and give a warning about the conversion._\r\n\r\n**Final Comments**\r\n- There are more solutions to this but I think these two are the most straightforward. I also have the code ready for the first solution and will send a pull request if that is chosen, otherwise I'll take a day's time to send a pull request if we move forward with any other solution.\r\n- I can also add unit tests regarding the same, I don't know if having tests for private methods are a thing or not, but I think it won't hurt having more tests.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nD:\\Anaconda\\envs\\sktime-dev\\lib\\site-packages\\_distutils_hack\\__init__.py:33: UserWarning: Setuptools is replacing distutils.\r\n  warnings.warn(\"Setuptools is replacing distutils.\")\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 05:59:00) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nexecutable: D:\\Anaconda\\envs\\sktime-dev\\python.exe\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.22000-SP0\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.1.2\r\n   setuptools: 63.1.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.1.1\r\n       sktime: 0.13.0\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.22.4\r\n        scipy: 1.8.1\r\n       pandas: 1.4.3\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.2\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.2\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
