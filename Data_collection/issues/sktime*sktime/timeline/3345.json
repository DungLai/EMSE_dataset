https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/3345.\r\nThere was a strange shortcut from `_inverse_transform` of `Differencer`, which just returned data seen before if the `transform` indices had all been seen (not if some had been seen). This is highly unexpected behaviour, as @ilkersigirci pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe fix was not easy due to domino effects in the code, effectifely I rewrote the `Differencer` entirely.\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is as in the expectation @ilkersigirci has outlined: when `inverse_transform` is called, previously seen data is taken into account when inverting, in a window before the data to be inverted that has the length of cumulative lag.\r\nFor multiple lag values, this requires logic to compute iterated differences in that window.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the `Differencer` now always properly inverts in `inverse_transform`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds:\r\n* the test case of @ilkersigirci, minimally modified, so as not to include the value at the first index which is required to be outside the `fh` for proper inversion.\r\n* a parameter `memory` for the `Differencer` which allows to control how much of the data seen in `fit`/`update` should be remembered for potential inversion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1227839057","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3345#issuecomment-1227839057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3345","id":1227839057,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5JL1ZR","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-25T23:03:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T23:03:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for the explanation, @ilkersigirci.\r\n\r\nI looked in the `Differencer`, and there was a strange shortcut that had the described effect precisely under the condition that you outlined.
