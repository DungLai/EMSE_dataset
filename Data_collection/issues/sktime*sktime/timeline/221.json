I've just ran it on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alan-turing-institute/sktime/master?filepath=examples) and it worked for me.  \r\n\r\nIt may be a statsmodels version issue. What's your statsmodels version? Mine is `0.9.0`. Run this to get it:\r\n```python\r\nimport statsmodels\r\nstatsmodels.__version__\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also try to explicitly fit the model without a trend:\r\n```python\r\ndef ar_coefs(x, maxlag=100):\r\n    x = np.asarray(x).ravel()\r\n    nlags = np.minimum(len(x) - 1, maxlag)\r\n    model = AR(endog=x) \r\n    return model.fit(maxlag=nlags, trend=\"nc\").params.ravel()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're actually looking for someone who's interested in encapsulating these helper functions into transformers, so that we can use transformers directly rather than wrapping them in `FunctionTransformers`, let me know if you're interested in contributing!
