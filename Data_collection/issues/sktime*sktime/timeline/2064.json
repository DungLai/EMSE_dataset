PR introduces two new mtypes for the `Table` scitype:\r\n* a `pandas.Series` based mtype, `pd_Series_Table`, which has less conditions on the type than for time series (e.g., no ordered indices needed). This is being used in various components of classifiers, where `y` is a `pandas.Series` but without ordered time index.\r\n* `list_of_dict`, which is a `list` of `dict` with the condition that all entries are primitive (`str`, `int`, or `float`). This is currently returned by bag of words type transformers, see discussion in #2064. Introduction of this type would make those transformers interface compliant.\r\n\r\nFYI @patrickzib, @MatthewMiddlehurst
