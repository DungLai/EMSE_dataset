the problem? The properties of composites may depend on components.\r\nEspecially in pipelines this is important, so it would be good if there is something like a \"dynamic tag\".\r\nAt least, it should be settable or overridable at construction.\r\n\r\n>the tag should be set to False, the composite doesn't require the forecasting horizon during fitting, it merely passes it on to the components, which have their own tag and raise an error accordingly if they require the forecasting horizon during fitting\r\n\r\ndisagreed!\r\n\r\nI think each forecaster should be able to tell the user in advance whether it will raise an error when no `fh` is passed to fit. What else is the purpose of these tags?

Reference Issues/PRs\r\nEnhancement proposal: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/01_forecasting_api/forecasting_pipeline.md\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nForecastingPipeline for pipelining with exog data\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n1. Inheritance from new class `_Pipeline`\r\n2. There is an issue to use the `ForecastingPipeline` just for the purpose of a transformer pipeline, bcz in the transformer interface, we allow in `transform(Z, X)` that `Z` can be a `pd.DataFrame` but in the `fit(y, X)` function `y` must be a `pd.Series`. Solutions for this which I have considered:\r\n    1)  It would only be allowed to use `ForecastingPipeline` as a transformer pipeline if `y` and `X` are given like `fit_transform(y, X)`. This is the status when I open this PR.\r\n    2)  We could add an if-statement in `fit()` to catch cases where `y` is a `pd.DataFrame`, however this would be an impact to the interface that we allow `y` to be a `pd.DataFrame` which is never the case so far. \r\n    3) We dont implement `transform()` for `ForecastingPipeline`\r\n\r\nGeneral question of using `ForecastingPipeline` or `TranformedTargetForecaster` as a transformer pipeline: when calling `fit_transform`, the `fit` and `transform` functions are called and this means that also the given `forecaster` is fitted. So also a forecaster has to be given, but we might want to allow `forecaster=None`. This might probably best be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

So if say unequal_length == true, an object of this class is capable of taking as input unequal class values and is safe to build with data having that characteristic. There may be many ways a class can deal with a data characteristic, and there may be an object variable that can determine that and be set in the constructor. However, the capabilities are simply for error checking: if you pass a certain type of data and it will crash the algorithm, it should throw a meaningful exception. Configuring capabilities doesn't make sense to me, that should require new code. Having capabilities declared at the class value makes it very easy to see what a class can do. However, it may screw up the _fit/fit model assuming the point of that is to generalise the checks before overloaded _fit() is called, I'm not sure how python handles this kind of polymorphism. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/865941444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/865968017","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/981#issuecomment-865968017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/981","id":865968017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTk2ODAxNw==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-22T13:08:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T13:08:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">So if say unequal_length == true, an object of this class is capable of taking as input unequal class values and is safe to build with data having that characteristic\r\n\r\nYes, but please consider what I'm saying.\r\n\r\nWhether unequal class values can be dealt with an object, may depend on the parameters and components of that object.
