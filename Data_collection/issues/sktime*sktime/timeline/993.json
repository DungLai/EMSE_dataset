this is now split into two PR, this one for `BaseSeriesAnnotator` (renamed from `BaseStremAnnotator` and one for `BasePanelAnnotator` (PR #1036).\r\n\r\nThis also includes the `pyod` adapter from #1022, and hence introduces a `pyod>=0.8.0.` soft dependency.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of @satya-pattnaik's excellent annotation base template #838 that should allow sub-classing or other treatment of non-point-annotation and multi-sample/panel annotation use cases as not uncommon in neuroscience and beyond.\r\n\r\nI've created two base classes:\r\n\r\n* `BaseStreamAnnotator` which follows most closely @satya-pattnaik's original design\r\n* `BasePanelAnnotator` which extends the design to panel annotation tasks\r\n\r\nI've thought long after the first proposal (of mine, i.e., the first commits below) and I think it's not a good idea I had after all, to \"merge\" the characteristics of both into one. This becomes most clear when you look at what the `update` mode should be - temporal, or adding more sequences?\r\n\r\nChanges in both classes:\r\n* rename of series to be annotated from `Z` to `X` - the user expectation is `predict(X)` not `predict(Z)`\r\n* `X` is by default a `pd.DataFrame`, not `pd.Series`. Annotation is typically multivariate, and this is in compliance with the target interface for forecasting.\r\n* adopted nested `fit/_fit` architecture from `forecasting` refactor - it's consensus we're moving towards this, see also #993\r\n* additional, optional argument in `fit`: `Y`, ground truth annotations - for supervised annotation\r\n* allow annotations to be of any `pandas` `dtype`, this allows complex annotations like BIDS (see sktime neuro https://github.com/sktime/sktime-neuro/issues/7)\r\n\r\nAdditions in the `BaseStreamAnnotator`:\r\n\r\n* `update` and `update_predict` functionality, so we can use it in time series streams and directly with forecasters\r\n\r\nAdditions in `BasePanelAnnotator`:\r\n* `X` can be a list of sequences to be annotated (all `pd.DataFrame`)\r\n* additional, optional argument in `fit` and `predict`: `Z`, `pd.DataFrame` of same `len` as `X` - any metadata on the sequences to annotate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T13:02:45Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T13:02:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1026","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1026/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1026/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1026/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/1026","id":928233506,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njc2MjY2ODk3","number":1026,"title":"TSC
