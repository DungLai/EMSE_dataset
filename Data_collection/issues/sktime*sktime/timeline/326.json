few useful change to improve our release/distribution cycle:\r\n\r\n- [x] compile manylinux wheels (see #188)\r\n- [x] set up CI to directly upload wheels to PyPI\r\n- [x] include Makefile to automise release workflow (see this [intro](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/make/make.html), also see e.g. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CleverCSV/blob/master/make_release.py)\r\n- [x] enforce code formatting in released code (see #208, #256)\r\n- [x] add coverage for unit tests (see #394)\r\n- [ ] add code quality/climate checks (see https://lgtm.com, https://www.codacy.com, https://github.com/marketplace/code-climate, etc)\r\n- [ ] consider [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/tree/master/cibuildwheel) package to simplify wheel building across platforms\r\n- [ ] improve packaging for macOS wheels with [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate), also included in cibuildwheel, also see https://iscinumpy.gitlab.io/post/azure-devops-python-wheels/ \r\n- [x] distribute sktime via conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/#contribute (see #326)\r\n- [x] set up [pre-commit config](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/) (see #394)\r\n- [x] add Black for code formatting (see #394)\r\n- [x] add [check-manifest](https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/) (see #394)\r\n- [x] add [bugbear](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-bugbear/) to flake8 (see #394)\r\n- [x] update setup.cfg, see e.g. https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram/blob/develop/setup.cfg (see #394)\r\n- [ ] check out other [flake8 extensions](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions)\r\n- [ ] add checks for broken website links: https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastlinkcheck/\r\n- [ ] use GitHub Action to check if Binder works and pre-build Docker images for quicker launch: https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action#use-github-actions-to-cache-the-build-for-binderhub \r\n- [ ] explore [pre-commit-ci](https://pre-commit.ci) as suggested in #794 \r\n\r\n#### Extra resources\r\n* For building/distribution on GitHub Actions checkout: https://scikit-hep.org/developer/gha_wheels\r\n* Useful links from [reproducible research
