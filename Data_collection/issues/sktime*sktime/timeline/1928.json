Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #2514 wrote some tests to see if `MultiplexForecaster` performs as expected.  \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nEssentially - run `ForecastingGridSearchCV`  on `MultiplexForecaster` and verify that the best forecaster from the grid search is also the one we select if we simply evaluated all the forecasters separately. \r\n\r\n*Note - I use a very small data set and only compare have 2 forecasters in `MultiplexForecaster`.  I did this to not make the test too slow - but it is not the most thorough test.  Hopefully it would still help catch some obvious issues.*\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nAny other obvious tests that should be added? Should we add more forecasters?  Does this test make sense to you? \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n@aiwalter I went ahead and added you as an author to this file.  I figured since you had a hand in co-creating `MultiplexForecaster` in the first place and also weighed in on #2514 it seemed reasonable.  However - please let me know if you would prefer if I removed you. \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [DOC] or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, documentation or bug\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1179770587","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1928#issuecomment-1179770587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1928","id":1179770587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5GUd7b","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-10T17:46:43Z","updated_at":"2022-07-10T17:46:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"resolved by this PR https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2845","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1179770587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6965317153,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5CWg31zwAAAAGfKk4h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6965317153","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-10T17:46:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
