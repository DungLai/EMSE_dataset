The assumption is that each column is a dimension of a multiviariate time series, with dimension 1 in column 1. It is up to the classifier to decide if it can handle multivariate/missing/unequal length, through some standard Capabilites mechanism perhaps (thats how Weka does it) all of which will be encoded when we extend pandas. For the univariate equal length case we start with, simply extract the first dimension.\r\n\r\nInstantiations: within the HIVE-COTE directory, bespoke implementations of TSF, RISE, BOSS, EE, ST and

probably just me, but I find column-wise ensemble a confusing name that requires a deep understanding of the data structure model. I would call it DimensionWise or something. Still, lets close this.

agree, it's not the most intuitive, but I prefer the column terminology over the dimension one because (i) given our data container, we actually refer to columns, whereas dimensions could refer to something else as well, e.g. the `shape` of an array, and (ii) because it's similar as a compositor to sklearn's `ColumnTransformer`. So `ColumnEnsembleClassifier` and `ColumnConcatenator` sounds about right to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/515038833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
