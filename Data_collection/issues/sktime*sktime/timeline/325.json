We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReally liking this package!

If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf this is an accepted solution to #325, I'm happy to update the docs with using `extras_require` in `setup.py`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3840951127,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg0MDk1MTEyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3840951127","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-05T15:02:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3840951235,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4NDA5NTEyMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3840951235","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b0b2058c95f7131986e57bac1f8764d135a7059f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/b0b2058c95f7131986e57bac1f8764d135a7059f","created_at":"2020-10-05T15:02:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
