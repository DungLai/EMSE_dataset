let me and @aiwalter know if there is anything we can help with in terms of #840. \r\n\r\nIn terms of moving `HampelFilter` after #840 is complete, what is the expected sub-module structure for the `annotation` module? \r\n\r\nThere are the related tasks of segmentation, outlier detection, anomaly detection, and so on. Do we want to group things that are used for certain tasks into a sub-module to make it easier for users? \r\n\r\nTo me at least outlier detection seems like a specific case of anomaly/novelty detection (outliers being particular types of anomalies). What I don't really know about is what we mean when we say \"segmentation\". Is that different enough that the you'd be using one set of algorithms to solve that task and a different set for anomaly detection? \r\n\r\nIf so, this would leave submodules organized be something like: `sktime.annotation.anomaly_detection` and `sktime.annotation.segmentation`. \r\n\r\nInterested to hear your thoughts so we can figure out where in the `annotation` module to move the
