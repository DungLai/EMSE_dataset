Conversion between fif, edf, etc is better located in a separate package dedicated to handling of those data formats, or a package specific to medical data, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nLoading functionality (from specific file format to memory representation, say specific `DataFrame` formats) is another story, I think that's more a grey area since the in-memory format is framework-specific - it might be a good idea to have *that* in `sktime`.\r\n\r\nIn either case, I'd strongly recommend to scope what the existing solutions are, to avoid reinventing and recreating the
