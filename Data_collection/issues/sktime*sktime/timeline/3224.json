In recursive reduction, concurrent is default. Shifted is obtained by lagging `X` with a lag of 1 (we could turn thsi into a parameter, too).\r\n\r\n> use of transformers on X, e.g., window summarizer\r\n\r\nTransformers for `X` are not passed to the reducers, but need to be applied via a pipeline.\r\nThis is more modular, and avoids duplication and \"god class\" like parameter handling.\r\n\r\n> removing missing values created due to shifting/windowing\r\n\r\ndone by parameter `impute` which is looped through to `Imputer`.\r\nAll options in `Imputer` are available in reduction.\r\n\r\n`Imputer` has no missing value removal, but that could be added as an option, and would also add the option to the reducers, via the estimator modular dependency.\r\n\r\n> treating missing values created due to shifting/windowing (e.g. filling)\r\n\r\noption via the `Imputer`.\r\n\r\n> treating missing values from shifting/windowing differently from pre-existing missing values, including options to leave the latter be\r\n\r\nThis is solved by the possibility to attach another `Imputer` earlier in the pipeline, this handles only pre-existing missing values.

I was wondering: what about the use of covariates in X of which we do not know the future values? Sklearn regressors are capable of handling these, but might they need any special treatment in the reducer? For example, when we have a dataset of past data we do have the future (test) values for these covariates. But in order to test a realistic scenario, we would need to set our test set's future values for this covariate to NA (I assume). Could this perhaps be something handled by the reducer?
