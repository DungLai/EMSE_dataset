a stupid question: why can we not just have this as a multivariate (endog) forecasting problem? The `make_reduction` has probably anyway to be adjusted to handle this once we have multivariate interface. So the above example data would then just be:\r\n\r\n| Time  | Sales_1 | Sales_2 | Sales_3 | Sales_X |\r\n| :---: | :---:    | :---: | :---: | :---: |\r\n| Dec | 283  | 123| 333| ... |\r\n| Jan | 113| 313| 243 | ... |\r\n| Feb | 312 | 233| 22 | ... |\r\n\r\nThe `Sales_X` would be the sales of store `X`. So we would have a vector forecast with `n` endog variables where `n` is the amount of stores. Having this data shape, we can just apply the `make_reduction` and you can use any tree-based model. So we would not need a `make_panel_reduction` function but just adjust the `make_reduction` to multivariate (if this is not yet the case, it has to be done anyway). The function you would need to bring your data into the data shape I wrote above could be done with some pandas functions probably. But this could be contributed maybe, if this kind of data shape (what you called panel data) is often used?

Vector forecasting in such a scenario makes sense when there is inter-dependency between \"Sales_1\", \"Sales_2\"(might be because of competition).\r\nA use case for this is - when forecasting sales of items inside the **\"same\"** category. Two items of same category but different brands might have inter-dependence(in their sales) because of promotions, discount on one affects the sales of the other(adversely).\r\n\r\nCAT1_DELL<sub>T</sub> =  L1 * CAT1_DELL<sub>T-1</sub> + L2 * CAT1_MAC<sub>T-1</sub> + e1\r\nCAT1_MAC<sub>T</sub> =  M1 * CAT1_MAC<sub>T-1</sub> + M2 * CAT1_DELL<sub>T-1</sub>

have Vector Forecast when we are considering data across different stores/geographic locations/categories as there might not be any inter-dependence. \r\n\r\nFor e.g in the M5 data - vector forecasting sales of items from \"HOUSEHOLD\" category and \"FOOD\" category will not be helpful.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to vector forecast using Decision Trees, the way that I know is the one I mentioned above(which is a proxy to vector forecasting) where we pass the **\"group ids\"** as categorical indicators and the lags to be grouped by the respective group ids.\r\nWill be happy to

take the liberty to quote this from [Hyndman et al](https://www.monash.edu/business/ebs/research/publications/ebs/wp45-2020.pdf).\r\n\r\n**\"There is a large overlap between global models and multivariate forecasting models, because both work on groups of time series. In practical terms, global models are univariate time series models, they only require observations of a single time series for forecasting, they use the group for finding good predictive functions. Consequently, global models are more generally applicable because they do not require observations from multiple time series at the time of forecasting. Multivariate models work on groups that are supposed to have some form of interaction or joint evolution, global models work on any group. For example, forecasting a pandemic with a global model can benefit from time series measured at different historic periods (separated by decades), controlled experiments or even different pathogens, while a multivariate model is limited to the evolution of the current one and factors that influence it. Another example could be electricity consumption patterns, a global model could pool data from different places around the world to find a shared pattern, while it is clear that completely unrelated households at different corners of the world will not benefit from a multivariate approach that used their joint evolution.\"**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/894673842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"satya-pattnaik","id":22102468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTAyNDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22102468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik","html_url":"https://github.com/satya-pattnaik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5125874884,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NTEyNTg3NDg4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5125874884","actor":{"login":"satya-pattnaik","id":22102468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTAyNDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22102468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik","html_url":"https://github.com/satya-pattnaik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satya-pattnaik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-07T16:12:02Z","rename":{"from":"Panel Forecasting Using Decision Trees/Decision Tree Ensembles","to":"GLobal/Panel Forecasting Using Decision Trees/Decision Tree Ensembles"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/894867856","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1132#issuecomment-894867856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1132","id":894867856,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc41VpmQ","user":{"login":"ltsaprounis","id":64217214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE3MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64217214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis","html_url":"https://github.com/ltsaprounis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-08T22:57:02Z","updated_at":"2021-08-08T22:57:02Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> Anything you want to add @ltsaprounis?\r\n\r\nThanks @satya-pattnaik! Not much, just more quotes :smile:\r\n\r\nThese methods were used by the majority of the high ranking M5 submissions. The paper [The M5 Accuracy competition: Results, findings and conclusions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344487258_The_M5_Accuracy_competition_Results_findings_and_conclusions) lists the findings from the accuracy comp in M5. One of the findings is **the value of cross-learning**:\r\n\r\n_\" In the previous M competitions, most of the series were uncorrelated, of a different frequency and domain, and chronologically unaligned. Therefore, although both of the top-performing submissions of M4 considered “cross-learning” from multiple series concurrently, instead of one series at a time, their approach was difficult to implement effectively in practice, and did not demonstrate the full potential of the approach. In contrast, since the M5 consisted of aligned, highly-correlated series structured in a hierarchical fashion, “cross-learning” was made much easier to apply, achieving superior results when compared to methods that were trained in a series-by-series fashion. Note that, apart from resulting in more accurate forecasts, “cross-learning” implies the use of a single model instead of multiple ones, each trained on the data of a different series, thus reducing overall computational cost and mitigating difficulties related to limited historical observations. Essentially, all top 50 performing methods in M5 utilized “cross-learning”, exploiting all the information being offered by the dataset.\"_ \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above - in the case of M5 the global forecasting methods can also be seen as **hierarchical** as the product / store hierarchy was introduced in the model as categorical variables. Interested to hear @fkiraly's opinion on this and the implications on a hierarchical forecasting API!\r\n\r\nIn terms of the data container, in my custom implementation of this, I've used a long format pandas dataframe similar to the format from @satya-pattnaik  here:\r\n> \r\n> We need a `make_panel_reduction` with exogenous variables which transforms the data into the following format.\r\n>
