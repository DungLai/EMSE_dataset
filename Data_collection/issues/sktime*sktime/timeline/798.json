Problem\r\n\r\nIn financial applications it is common to be interested in predicting at time $t$ the direction of change for an asset at time $t+m$, where $m \\geq 1$ is a future time period. Generally speaking, there are three possibilities. In the time period $[t,t+m]$ either the price can go up, down or there will be no change. \r\n\r\nThis problem can be decomposed in several smaller, more manageable ones, namely:\r\n\r\n1. Dimensionality Reduction and/or Feature Extraction\r\n1. Feature Transformation\r\n1. Changepoint Detection\r\n1. Annotation (Labelling)\r\n1. Temporal cross validation and estimator tuning\r\n\r\n \r\n# Solution\r\nIdeally, we would have a pipeline which chains together the different elements of the algorithm. In contrast to `sklearn` pipelines we will need the capability to chain the different steps in the pipeline not only sequentially but in any giver order. Furthermore, we will need a functionality for transforming and processing both the features and the labels in our dataset.\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\n`mlfinlab` has functionality with which directional forecasts can be made. However, it is not implemented as a pipeline but rather as a collection of loose functions organised in modules. Furthermore, `mlfinlab` is not open source. \r\n\r\nOther open source toolboxes that tackle at least part of the problem include:\r\n* `ruptures` deals with change point detection, \r\n* `ADTK` with anomaly detection (specific case of change point detection), \r\n* `PyOD` was covers outlier detection (specific case of change point detection)\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n## Background: `mlfinab` example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n#feature reduction and annotation\r\ndaily_vol = ml.util.volatility.get_daily_vol(close=dollar_bars['close'], lookback=5)\r\ncusum_events = ml.filters.cusum_filter(dollar_bars['close'], threshold=-0.1)\r\nvertical_barriers = ml.labeling.add_vertical_barrier(t_events=cusum_events, close=dollar_bars['close'], num_days=5)\r\ntriple_barrier_events = ml.labeling.get_events(close=dollar_bars['close'],\r\n                                                t_events=cusum_events,\r\n                                                pt_sl=[1, 1], # sets the width of the barriers\r\n                                                target=daily_vol * 2, # twice the daily vol\r\n                                                min_ret=0.005,\r\n                                                num_threads=4,\r\n                                                vertical_barrier_times=vertical_barriers,\r\n                                                side_prediction=None,\r\n                                                verbose=False)\r\ntriple_labels = ml.labeling.get_bins(triple_barrier_events, dollar_bars['close'])\r\n\r\n#tune and fit an estimator\r\ntrain_idx, test_idx = train_test_split(np.arange(dataset.shape[0]), shuffle=False, test_size=0.25)\r\ncv_gen = ml.cross_validation.PurgedKFold(samples_info_sets=samples_info_sets['t1'].iloc[train_idx], n_splits=5, pct_embargo=0.01)\r\ngs = GridSearchCV(estimator=estimator, param_grid=param_grid, scoring='neg_log_loss', cv=cv_gen)\r\ntrain_dts = dataset.iloc[train_idx]\r\nX = train_dts.iloc[:,0:lookback]\r\ny = train_dts['bin']\r\n\r\ngs.fit(X,y)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background: `sktime` transformers\r\n\r\nBelow is the `sktime` base transformer class\r\n```Python\r\n\r\nclass BaseTransformer(BaseEstimator):\r\n    \"\"\"Transformer base class\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super(BaseTransformer, self).__init__()\r\n\r\n    def fit(self, Z, X=None):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Fit transformer to X and y.\r\n        By default, fit is empty.
