Maybe have one for univariate and one for multivariate classifiers (e.g. `check_X_univariate` and `check_X_multivariate`) .\r\n\r\nI think we agreed to support numpy arrays or pandas series inside the dataframe (i.e. inside each cell). But this is a more general check I guess and should maybe be handled by the data container but happy to add it to `check_ts_array` function.

This is similar to traits \"can deal with NA within series\", \"can deal with non-equally spaced series\", or \"can deal with heterogeneous time stamps\".\r\n\r\nIt would also be more consistent with the typing/reduction philosophy: note how \"splitting a D-dimensional series column into D 1-dimensional series columns\" is similar to the series-to-primitive type of transformers - it's an act of reduction.\r\nWhy is this reduction: you lose the information which columns came from the same multi-dimensional series originally!
