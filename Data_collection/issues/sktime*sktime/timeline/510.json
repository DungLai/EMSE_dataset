think my contribution to those classes was when I tidied up the prediction intervals API, so I only have one very specific perspective on this. That said, I felt very much the same as you at the time I worked on it - I was unsure what the justification was for two separate classes (there was probably a good reason at the time, but it seems less clear now). It was difficult to figure out where new methods should live.\r\n\r\nSomething I liked in earlier versions of sktime that perhaps we could return to in this refactor is a simplification of the docstrings. At the moment, the documentation is spread across both private and public methods. Not only does this clutter up the codebase a little (and make it less readable), but it doesn't play as nicely with documentation tools like sphinx. I think it could be better to keep all of the meaningful user-focussed documentation in the public methods, and the private methods can contain very light documentation notes for developers (if absolutely necessary), or be undocumented (comments where they are called in the public methods can explain what they are being used for if needed).

This information is typically not suitably covered by an auto-generated API reference, as it is distributed across classes - the generic template, and the conventions implemented in the concrete desendants. Sth like in sklearn dev guidelines could work, but I'd actually prefer to also have \"formal\" template definitions collected in one place. While the typing makes things clearer, it also makes the necessity to document the interface cleanly greater.\r\n\r\nOpinions, @mloning, @TonyBagnall?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the \"final form\"

PR is addressing the forecaster base class proliferation discussed in #510, by simplifying the base class inheritance tree and the streamlining the private method logic.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I've moved the logic from `_SktimeForecaster` and the forecasting horizin mixins into `BaseForecaster`, and adopted uniformly the principle of having a public method (`fit`, `predict`, etc) with checks/plumbing, dispatching to a \"core logic\" version (`_fit`, `_predict`, etc) where validated arguments can be assumed.\r\n\r\nThe burden on extenders becomes much lighter, since it is now possible to only focus on the \"core logic\" implementation, instead of having to keep in mind a myriad of inconsistent and constantly shifting conventions in checks and other plumbing.\r\n\r\nAs side effects, if we get this right, this should make a few things on the roadmap easier:\r\n* the extension guidelines #464. Right now, the aforementioned implicit conventions are too many and intricate to write useful extension guidelines, in my opinion.\r\n* extending to the multivariate case\r\n* input/output checks and the eternal data container discussion, this can go in the plumbing\r\n\r\nAs a proof-of-concept regarding ease of extension, this PR also contains a highly annotated extension template in the `extension_templates` folder.\r\n\r\nIn terms of review, the key file is `forecasting/base/_base`, with corresponding changes (contraction and deletion) in `base/_sktime`.\r\n\r\nI've tried to keep the interface consistent as much as possible (only changing internal logic).\r\n\r\nInterface contracts with all the earlier estimators are still honoured, via loopthroughs and default behaviour that ensures that everything still works if `fit`, `predict` etc are overridden by the current descendants, as opposed to `_fit` and `_predict`.\r\nThe only change I had to made to descendants is set `self._is_fitted=False` at the start of `fit`, which is a minimally invasive change that's also separately reviewable as PR #941.\r\n\r\nThere should only be a single change that breaks the tagging/inspection interface, which is replacing the choice of which forecasting horizon mixin one inherits from with a choice of the new `fh_in_fit` tag (can be `'requried'` or `'optional'`).\r\nTemporarily, I've left both mixins and the `_SktimeForecaster` in and handled their behaviour as expected (inheriting from a mixin sets the `fh_in_fit` tag), so existing classes should still run, unless there is interface inconsistency or bugs in my refactor. Mid-term, we may want to remove the fh-mixins and `_SktimeForecaster` in favour of a single `BaseForecaster` class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/912/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/860083974","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/510#issuecomment-860083974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/510","id":860083974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MDA4Mzk3NA==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-12T17:27:59Z","updated_at":"2021-06-12T17:28:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"From #941 on the refactoring of `_set_fh`:\r\n\r\n> I've thought about this a bit more and I prefer the option where we pass the name of the calling method to _set_fh, e.g. _set_fh(fh, method=\"fit\").

beginning of fit,\r\n> * it keeps it closer to the implementation of other estimator types where we do not re-set the state at the beginning of fit,\r\n> * it avoids the redundancy of having to set

Reference issues/PR\r\nConditional on #955 \r\nRelated to #510 \r\n\r\n#### Suggested changes\r\nI've thought about this a bit more and I prefer the option where we pass the name of the calling method to `_set_fh` in the `BaseForecaster`, e.g. `_set_fh(fh, method=\"fit\")`. For me, the main reasons are:\r\n* it keeps the functionality for checking/setting the fh contained to that function and does not assume state changes elsewhere in the code, like at the beginning of fit,\r\n* it keeps it closer to the implementation of other estimator types where we do not re-set the state at the beginning of fit,\r\n* it avoids the redundancy of having to set _is_fitted=False in the constructor and at the beginning of fit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5176433031,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxNzY0MzMwMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5176433031","actor":{"login":"afzal442","id":11625672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjI1Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11625672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442","html_url":"https://github.com/afzal442","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afzal442/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"43b6612e0d00f504ec3d35ad99887e8782ae5beb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/afzal442/sktime/commits/43b6612e0d00f504ec3d35ad99887e8782ae5beb","created_at":"2021-08-18T18:14:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5257702242,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc4s4YYjzwAAAAE5Yiti","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5257702242","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"65aed76a5255cd89395519ca83fc25ab20578412","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/65aed76a5255cd89395519ca83fc25ab20578412","created_at":"2021-09-05T16:49:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-23T21:02:18Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T21:02:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1923/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1923","id":1111985153,"node_id":"I_kwDOCVKAsc5CR4wB","number":1923,"title":"[ENH]
