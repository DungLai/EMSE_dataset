#671 by adding requested functionality. \r\n\r\nThis is a draft pull request. I need to finish the docstrings (I'm adding examples to docstrings) and also write unit tests but wanted to give you a heads up of the functionality. \r\n\r\nThe pull request adds new forecasting performance metrics (see list below) that can each work with multivariate series (but default to work with univariate forecasts). Also changes naming conventions to align with scikit-learn (e.g. mean_absoluate_error rather than mae or mae_loss). \r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n\r\nrelative_error,\r\nmean_asymmetric_error,\r\nmean_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmean_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmean_absolute_error,\r\nmean_squared_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_squared_error,\r\nmean_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmean_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmean_relative_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNot as coded. But several of the functions could be replaced by wrappers on scikit-learn functions. However, this would require changing the scikit-learn dependency to be >=0.24 which might be unneeded. \r\n\r\nAs coded, I use their code (need to ensure I have references to the places I do that) to avoid the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nLet me know if the naming convention changes to the forecasting metrics makes sense. To me it makes sense to keep this as aligned with scikit-learn's metrics. \r\n\r\nNote that I also added a few tweaks in the validation functions to support the ability to validate the input data to these functions. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/789703579","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/712#issuecomment-789703579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/712","id":789703579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4OTcwMzU3OQ==","user":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-03T13:10:49Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T13:10:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@mloning I've been reading through the proposal. Wouldn't another option be to just incorporate the conditional logic in the callable aspect of the metrics to start callable to start? Since I'm relatively new to considering the impact of these choices on a module API, I'm Interested to hear you thought process on deciding between incorporating the logic in MetricFunctionWrapper to start instead of adapting it at run time.\r\n\r\nI was also wondering about the `__call__` part of the `_adapter`. By defining  `__call__(self, y_true, y_pred, y_train, *args, **kwargs)` is our goal to require every metric call to pass y_train? \r\n\r\nWhy not just let `y_train` be passed in the *args? We could assume that when it is necessary it is the first of any optional args that are passed.  Let me know what you think the pros and cons of this approach are versus explicitly requiring y_train being passed.  \r\n\r\nAlso note that some of the metrics require a benchmark forecast (these might not be easy to work into cross-validation unless we allow users to provide a benchmark or a benchmark method as part of an orchestrater). That being said, we can accommodate those metrics in MetricFunctionWrapper the same way y_train is accommodated pretty easily. \r\n\r\nSomething like the code below would incorporate the conditional callability in MetricFunctionWrapper instead of adapting it at run time. I've also added the accommodation of y_pred_benchmark. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MetricFunctionWrapper:\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self, fn, name=None, greater_is_better=False, requires_y_train=False, \r\n        requires_y_pred_benchmark=False\r\n    ):\r\n        self.fn = fn\r\n        self.name = name if name is not None else fn.__name__\r\n        self.greater_is_better = greater_is_better\r\n        self.requires_y_train=requires_y_train\r\n        self.requires_y_pred_benchmark=requires_y_pred_benchmark\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, y_true, y_pred, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        # if y_train is required, pass it on\r\n        if self.requires_y_train:\r\n            y_train = args[0]\r\n            if len(args) >  1:\r\n                args = args[1:]\r\n            else:\r\n                args=()\r\n            return self.fn(y_true, y_pred, y_train, *args, **kwargs)\r\n\r\n        # if y_pred_benchmark is required, pass it on\r\n        elif self.requires_y_pred_benchmark:\r\n            y_pred_benchmark= args[0]\r\n            if len(args) >  1:\r\n                args = args[1:]\r\n            else:\r\n                args=()\r\n            return self.fn(y_true, y_pred, y_pred_benchmark, *args, **kwargs)\r\n        \r\n        # otherwise, ignore y_train and y_pred_benchmark\r\n        else:\r\n            return self.fn(y_true, y_pred, *args, **kwargs) \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to do something like what you had originally but make the y_train parameter handle either the training data or a benchmark predictions. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MetricFunctionWrapper:\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self, fn, name=None, greater_is_better=False, requires_y_train=False, \r\n        requires_y_pred_benchmark=False\r\n    ):\r\n        self.fn = fn\r\n        self.name = name if name is not None else fn.__name__\r\n        self.greater_is_better = greater_is_better\r\n

about some time series regression metrics which are not present in scikit-learn? So far, scikit-learn has the MAPE. This measure has some serious shortcomings, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error#Issues). If you are interested in this topic, the following could be good additions:\r\n\r\n## Mean directional accuracy\r\nI think this one is especially interesting when you only want to predict the direction of your time series correctly. Up or down nothing else. A classic problem to apply this is when dealing with the prediction of stock prices. I don't really care if my model can tell me if the stock price rises by 10% or 20%, it's important that it rises. And the model won't output accurate percentages anyway. It makes it potentially easier to design a well-performing model according to this metric.\r\n\r\n## Logarithm of the accuracy ratio\r\n[Here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2635088), the author explains why it is a good measure. What I like about this measure: Usually, the MAPE punishes over and underestimating differently. If the actual value A is 2 and the forecast F is 1, the APE here is 0.5. If A=2 and F=4, the APE is 1. Two different scores, although the prediction is half or double the actual value, and I would like these errors to be the same. The Logarithm of the accuracy ratio does exactly that (0.48 in both cases). (By the way, the Mean directional accuracy does this, too.)\r\n\r\nAnother nice property is that the best constant prediction for some label vector y is the geometric mean of y. This is analog to the mean, which is the best constant prediction for the MSE metric, or the median for the MAD metric.\r\n\r\n[You can find my implementations here.](https://github.com/Garve/scikit-bonus/blob/master/skbonus/metrics/_regression.py)\r\n\r\nIf you like, I can do a pull request.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRobert","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/795414091","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/712#issuecomment-795414091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/712","id":795414091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NTQxNDA5MQ==","user":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-10T13:28:46Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T01:19:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thinking about it more after our talk, I think the `_MetricAdapter` approach makes sense. My suggestion above of changing the `__call__` definition in `MetricFunctionWrapper` would expose the need to pass `y_train` to end-users for metrics where it isn't needed. \r\n\r\nSince that just adds to confusion it is probably best to handle at call time. \r\n\r\nThe other option I've thought of is to add the class attributes (e.g. require_y_train, require_y_pred_benchmark) and have a function like `_apply_scoring` that just handles the conditional logic to pass the correct positional arguments based on the attributes. \r\n\r\nThis would be kind of a blend of options 2 and 3. Benefit would be not adapting the scorer themselves (e.g. they accept the arguments behind the scene that the users expects). But at the same time the conditional logic for calling the metrics only needs to exist in 1 place (the `_apply_scoring` function). \r\n\r\n@mloning let me know what you think on this versus `_MetricAdapter` and I can start implementing our preferred option and updating code in different places.

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #671. See discussion on closed PR #672 that this pull request will complete. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAdds additional forecasting metrics as discussed in #671. \r\n\r\nThis is a draft pull request. I need to finish the docstrings (I'm adding examples to docstrings) and also write unit tests but wanted to give you a heads up of the functionality.\r\n\r\nThe pull request adds new forecasting performance metrics (see list below) that can each work with multivariate series (but default to work with univariate forecasts). Also changes naming conventions to align with scikit-learn (e.g. mean_absoluate_error rather than mae or mae_loss).\r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n\r\nrelative_error,\r\nmean_asymmetric_error,\r\nmean_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmean_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmean_absolute_error,\r\nmean_squared_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_squared_error,\r\nmean_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmean_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmean_relative_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNone. Pinning Scikit-learn dependency to >= 0.24.* was done separately.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nFocus on changes in ./performance_metrics/forecasting/_functions.py and ./performance_metrics/forecasting/_classes.py. \r\n\r\nFinishing fixes elsewhere in module where old performance metric names (e.g. sMAPE) are imported. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for

I should have a draft pull request related to this fix in the next day or two. \r\n\r\nI've got the logic worked out to use `y_train` when necessary based on the `_tags` assigned to the metric. Just wanted to confirm the solution really quick, because I believe another suggestion might have come up when we closed out #801. \r\n\r\nBased on conversation above, one option is: \r\n```\r\nclass BaseMetric:\r\n\r\n    def __call__(... # regular arguments needed by the metric):\r\n        ... # regular user call\r\n\r\n    def _score(y_true, y_pred, y_train, ...):\r\n        ... # uniform handling of y_train inside higher-level functionality using _tagsabout y_train being required\r\n```\r\nWhere higher-level functionality like `evaluate` would always use the `_score(y_true, y_pred, y_train, ...)` method, but any regular user call would just require the user to pass whatever the usual call signature would be for the metric (e.g. we don't require the regular user call to include y_train when it isn't necessary). \r\n\r\nThe other option that I remember being mentioning (by @fkiraly I think) during the wrap-up of #801 was the possibility of a keyword argument for y_train that defaults to None (I interpreted this as being a keyword argument in `__call__`). In that case the solution would be something like the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass BaseMetric:\r\n\r\n    def __call__(y_true, y_pred, y_train = None):\r\n        ... # logic would use _tags to determine if y_train should be used in metric or not\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see pros and cons of both approaches. First option is nice that it doesn't expose users to keyword parameters that don't make sense for a given metric (e.g. why is y_train keyword parameter an option for mean_squared_error), but provides ability for things like `evaluate` to use `_score()` so we can include things like `MASE` in evaluation and tuning. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the second approach is nice in that the user interface when a user calls the class and when higher-level functionality like `evaulate` use the metric class are the same.  \r\n\r\nThe two approaches have a trade-off between having the same `__call__` arguments for every metric versus potentially confusing users by having `y_train` as keyword argument for metrics it is not needed for. Either should be workable for users with proper documentation (which we'll include). What are your thoughts from an API design perspective? \r\n\r\nDoes having different `__call__` signatures violate our API design principles, even if we have the
