pointed out by @Vasudeva-bit, some estimators were still using a `fit_params` kwarg in `_fit`.\r\n\r\nThis is non-compliant with the interface spec, but did not cause any errors since never anything was passed by kwargs.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply removes any `fit_params` kwargs and concomitant logic from the code base.\r\nNeeds no deprecation, since:\r\n* the interface spec is clear and the args occurred only in private functions, with one exception.\r\n* `evaluate` had the arg, but when used it would error out since no `fit` actually had the arg, so deprecation is also not necessary here (because we are changing from an \"error causing argument\" to \"no argument\", hence no one will have relied on it).\r\n\r\nSince this seems to be a frequent issue for extenders, I've added a paragraph to `_fit` in the classification, forecasting, and transformer extension templates (where it is most likely encountered due to interfacing as opposed to implementation from scratch).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6329469513,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc5Gpt1qzwAAAAF5RApJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6329469513","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-29T19:52:13Z","rename":{"from":"[ENH]
