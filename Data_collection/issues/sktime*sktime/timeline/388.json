But I think it would be also necessary to adapt my project to the\nsktime syntax. By the way, the Java implementation of PForest is even\nfaster, which seemed very \"funny\" even though I did my best to replicate\nthe same code using python. I think a thourough research on that point\nwould be interesting. By the way, for DTW I used a very interesting and\nvery powerful library (\nhttps://dtaidistance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/installation.html) and\nI'd be interesting with the DTW your team implemented\n\nAs for KNN + DTW, I also implemented the Lb_Enhanced distance researchers\nsay it's faster than Lb_Keogh, If you guys want to have a look.\n(The article: Elastic bands across the path: A new framework and method to\nlower bound DTW\n<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332892906_Elastic_bands_across_the_path_A_new_framework_and_method_to_lower_bound_DTW>\n)\n(The researchers project in github :\nhttps://github.com/ChangWeiTan/LbEnhanced.git)\n(My code: https://github.com/moradisten/KNN-LB.git)\n\nSo, we should discuss and organise this matters\n\nKind Regards\n\n\n\nEl jue., 8 oct. 2020 12:35, Markus Löning <notifications@github.com>\nescribió:\n\n> Yes testing your proximity forest against the sktime implementation and\n> potentially also the Java version in TSML\n> <https://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/tree/master/src/main/java/tsml/classifiers/distance_based/proximity>\n> would be a good start.
