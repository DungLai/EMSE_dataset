PR improves the `Detrender`:\r\n* it fixes https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/4051 and also simplifies the logic in the `Detrender`. As the `BaseForecasting` interface supports loop over hierarchy instances and variables natively, all the case distinctions internally can go, and with it goes the incorrect multivariate implementation.\r\n* adds support for detrending with hierarchical forecasters\r\n* adds support for detrending with forecasters that require `fh` in `fit` already (this was not possible previously)\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the test `test_polynomial_detrending` had to be updated since the internal mtype of the `Detrender` changed, from `pd.Series` based to `pd.DataFrame` based (requiring a minor change in how objects are being compared).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4053/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8144840548,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc5adk1HzwAAAAHleGdk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8144840548","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-03T17:34:19Z","rename":{"from":"[BUG]
