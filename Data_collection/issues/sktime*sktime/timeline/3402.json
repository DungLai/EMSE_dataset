I was looking into it and think that actually there is no bug. Reason is that `make_reduction` is doing the tabularization of the time series and therefore some past values of `y` go into `X`. You will see that doing following will therefore also raise the same exception.\r\n```pyhton\r\nmodel.fit(y_w_nan)\r\n```\r\nThe `X` is internally created to the lags:\r\n```\r\narray([[   nan, 61122., 60171., 61187., 63221., 63639., 64989., 63761.,\r\n        66019., 67857.],\r\n       [61122., 60171., 61187., 63221., 63639., 64989., 63761., 66019.,\r\n        67857., 68169.],\r\n       [60171., 61187., 63221., 63639., 64989., 63761., 66019., 67857.,\r\n        68169., 66513.],\r\n       [61187., 63221., 63639., 64989., 63761., 66019., 67857., 68169.,\r\n        66513., 68655.],\r\n       [63221., 63639., 64989., 63761., 66019., 67857., 68169., 66513.,\r\n        68655., 69564.],\r\n       [63639., 64989., 63761., 66019., 67857., 68169., 66513., 68655.,\r\n        69564., 69331.]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can understand that the exception might be a little confusing. We could write a custom exception around this, but actually I am not a big fan of wrapping exceptions.

I've got a few things in mind, but none of which seems convincing...\r\n\r\nI think the cleanes would be to to somehow check if the passed estimator can handle NaNs and if it doesn't, check `y` and `X` in sktime, before passing it to the estimator. However, I'm afraid that this is impossible.\r\nThe only thing I've found is a [small list of estimators that _are_ capable of handling NaNs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#estimators-that-handle-nan-values) in sklearn, but I don't think this can be used to build a stable mechanism.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to catch the exception, check if it says `Input X contains NaN.` and emit a warning or something But I don't like this approach as well, because (a) one would probably not read the warning anyways, if there is an exception right besides it and (b) reading a string intended for humans will probably never be stable (maybe another regressor says `NaN found in X input`...).\r\n(b) also applies for wrapping / reraising the exception as well, so I wouldn't consider this an option as well...\r\n\r\nMaybe a note in the documentation to also check your `y` if you see this exception might be the best option.
