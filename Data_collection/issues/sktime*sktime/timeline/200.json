Hm, this relates to discussions regarding re-work of the interface we were having last week and are going to have this week (Friday Nov 22 afternoon) at UCL. @big-o , would you mind indicating on Slack whether you are available?\r\n> \r\n> General discussion points involve:\r\n> \r\n> * `fit`, `predict`, and potential `update` method signature\r\n> * potential fused methods and their generics such as `fit_predict`, or `update_predict`\r\n> * treatment of exogenous variables and multi-variate series\r\n> * treatment of specification where to predict, including forecast horizon\r\n> * treatment of specification which variables to predict and predict from\r\n> * pro/con use of task object and `fit_task` or `predict_task` high-level methods, and/or mixins\r\n> \r\n> The plan is to end up with a concrete interface that we are all happy to adhere to and which is interoperable with the remainder of sktime and sklearn ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSorry I won't be able to join your meeting - I'll just share a few of my thoughts here instead. So far I've only worked with the forecasters and the `Deseasonaliser` transformer so my knowledge of the project is limited; I also won't claim to be fully aware of all the possible use cases. I'm coming at this from more of a layman's perspective and thinking about what I believe will be the most common uses of sktime forecasters for people like me. There's probably lots I've misunderstood here - feel free to correct me on anything!\r\n\r\nI think the rough idea of the current implementation is pretty good and easy to use for someone coming from previous experience of `sklearn`. There are a few things I think need addressing though:\r\n\r\n#### Method signatures\r\n\r\nI've just added a few thoughts on this to #199.\r\n\r\n#### Defining forecast horizons\r\n\r\nI've written something about this in #201.\r\n\r\n#### Data containers\r\n\r\nI realise this is a hot topic that's already being looked at, but I'll add my thoughts here as I believe it affects the forecasters. @mloning recently wrote a branch that changed forecasters to work with a normal `Series` instead of the \"nested dataframes\" used elsewhere. In my opinion this is a huge improvement. The nested frames were fiddly and unnecessarily complex, especially for new users. Unfortunately it doesn't escape the fact that you still need to convert things to/from nested frames if you want your forecaster to interact with any other parts of the library. I hit on this issue when writing the code for #198 - I had to deseasonalise/reseasonalise my series within the forecaster. To do that I have to perform some messy transforms on the data containers. Fortunately this is hidden from the users, but what if the user wants to build a pipeline like `[Transform, Forecast]`?  I think they will have the same issue.\r\n\r\nOne idea I discussed with @mloning was to move to using `xarray` instead, which supports N-D dataframes and therefore covers off multiple time series. The issues with `xarray`, as I understand, are:\r\n\r\n1) It won't support multiple unequal-length time series.\r\n2) It won't support multiple series with unaligned time indices.\r\n\r\nWe can address both issues with padding, but what value do we use to pad with? If we use the obvious choice, NaN, then we lose the ability to distinguish between missing data in the inputs and our padding. This to me isn't a problem with the data container; it's a lower-level problem caused by the fact that numpy defines two kinds of missing data, [NA (Unknown Yet Existing) and IGNORE (Doesn't Exist)](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0012-missing-data.html#glossary-of-terms), yet it provides no way of dealing with both types at once.\r\n\r\nI initially thought we could create a new type of padding object that behaves in a similar way to NaN but is distinguishable from it, or use sparse matrices that can contain NaN values, but I can't think of a good way to implement either of these approaches. Instead, I thought we could let the user provide a padding mask instead. This mask could be optional, that way the use case of having aligned, equal length time series can be achieved with a simple `xarray` (or even a flat `dataframe` for univariate series). For unaligned/unequal series, a helper function could be provided that converts a list of `pandas.Series` into an `(xarray, padmask)` tuple. The padmask can then be used internally to distinguish the NA NaNs (missing) from the IGNORE NaNs (padding). Hopefully this won't make it too difficult to implement algorithms, but I'll leave that for others with more knowledge to comment on.\r\n\r\nIn the case of forecasters and transformers, this would mean having an new optional `padmask` parameter in `fit()`. I don't think it would be needed in predict as the padmask should be the same for transformers (we don't transform non-existent data) and irrelevant for forecasters.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this would be a huge change, but I believe it would pay off in the long term to move away from the nested format if possible and now is the time to make sweeping changes while the project is still young.\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\nNot strictly a forecasting issue, but again I think it affects their usability so is worth mentioning. At the moment I feel the docs jump straight into the deep end and skip over a lot of the introductory stuff. sklearn's documentation is a learning resource in itself; it typically introduces the background theory for the task, demonstrates how to implement it with examples and provides detailed API information generated from the docstrings. I feel like the sktime docs assume the user already knows the subject well and just wants the technical detail.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm not so sure about the format. Notebooks are great for getting one or two points across, but any more than that and they quickly become unwieldy. I think a website provides a much better way to organise and present larger amounts of information. For that reason I would drop the notebooks and prioritise writing sphinx docs which include explanations of the subject matter as well as the implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Fitted params\r\n\r\nAt the moment the ARIMAForecaster wraps up a statsmodels SARIMAX object which does all of the heavy lifting. No problem there, but the forecaster doesn't effectively hide this from the user. If you want to inspect the fitted parameters, you have to inspect the internally stored SARIMAX object. You need knowledge of how the forecaster works (and hope that it hasn't been changed) to be able to use it. The fact that this object is called `_fitted_estimator` indicates that it shouldn't be exposed to users. The new ThetaForecaster on the other hand is implemented directly in sktime, so there is no fitted estimator object (`self` _is_ the estimator).\r\n\r\nIt's fine to wrap up other libraries with an sktime interface, but if we do that then anything the user might care about should be extracted from the wrapped API and stored as a parameter in the standard format, e.g. to get the smoothing level

This thread is to collect pro/con until the decision is made - issue is complete once we decide to remain with, or leave xpandas as the data container solution for the API and implement the alternative (note: in the case of leave the issue is only complete once the alternative is implemented in the existing code).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/555975710","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/200#issuecomment-555975710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/200","id":555975710,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTk3NTcxMA==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T12:05:20Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T12:05:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">Data containers\r\n\r\nCan of worms we've been keeping kicking down the road if you forgive me combining two metaphors here.

to make it...\r\nfor now we thought getting feature complete on the TSC/TSR and forecasting fronts would be a priority, as to showcase the reduction/composition arc-hitecture, but certainly

sklearn doesn't seem to do well either.\r\n\r\nIn my best of worlds, I'd like the entire sklearn ecosystem to have a `get_fitted_params` (and perhaps even `set_fitted_params`) interface that mirrors that of `get_params`, including nesting/deep access.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/555975710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/555980880","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/200#issuecomment-555980880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/200","id":555980880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTk4MDg4MA==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T12:21:18Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T12:21:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sorry,
