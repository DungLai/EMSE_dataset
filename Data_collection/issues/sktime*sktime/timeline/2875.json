for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new estimator `ReconcilerForecaster` which contains three reconciliation methods. See https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2157\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA new `ReconcilerForecaster` class which is a composite of a base forecaster and a reconciliation method. The idea/methods are similar to the `Reconciler`, except here the reconciliation matrix is estimated using variations on the base-forecast residual covariance matrix. The three methods either use the sample covariance matrix `method=\"mint_cov\"`, a shrunk covariance matrix `method=\"mint_shrink\"`, or only the on-diagonal elements `method=\"wls_var\"`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it would be easier or more intuitive for users if all of the reconciliation methods, including the transformers, were accessible though this estimator?\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-22T22:09:45Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T22:09:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3980","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3980/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3980/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3980/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3980","id":1508324235,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc5GENFo","number":3980,"title":"[BUG]

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the `ReconcilerForecaster` predict and update functions when the input data is not used in a pipeline with `Aggregator` or the input data is not aggregated before using with the class.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom sktime.datatypes import check_is_mtype\r\nfrom sktime.datatypes._utilities import get_window\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing.hierarchical import _make_hierarchical\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.sarimax import SARIMAX\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.reconcile import ReconcilerForecaster\r\n\r\ny = _make_hierarchical(\r\n    hierarchy_levels=(2, 4),\r\n    n_columns=1,\r\n    min_timepoints=24,\r\n    max_timepoints=24,\r\n    index_type=\"period\",\r\n)\r\ny_train = get_window(y, lag=2)\r\ny_test = get_window(y, window_length=2)\r\n\r\nX = _make_hierarchical(\r\n    hierarchy_levels=(2, 4),\r\n    n_columns=2,\r\n    min_timepoints=24,\r\n    max_timepoints=24,\r\n    index_type=\"period\",\r\n)\r\nX.columns = [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\r\nX_train = get_window(X, lag=2)\r\nX_test = get_window(X, window_length=2)\r\n\r\nforecaster = SARIMAX()\r\nestimator_instance = ReconcilerForecaster(forecaster, method=\"mint_shrink\")\r\nfh = [1, 2]\r\n# fit works ok\r\nestimator_instance.fit(y=y_train, X=X_train, fh=fh)\r\n# no aggregation in X so it fails\r\nestimator_instance.predict(X=X_test)\r\n# no aggregation in X or y so it fails again\r\nestimator_instance.update(y=y_test, X=X_test)\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n\r\n- Added necessary steps in the functions for automatically aggregating the data. \r\n- Also formatted the doc string a bit, but I would appreciate it if you can check that this is the correct way\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
