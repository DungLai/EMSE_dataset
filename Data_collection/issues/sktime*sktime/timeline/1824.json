first worth mentioning that my data set (before running it through the pipeline) does not contain any missing values. Anyway, I tried your suggestion of adding the `sktime` imputer before the `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor` function but I'm still running into the same `ValueError: Column must not contain NaN values: value` error.  \r\n\r\nFrom my understanding the `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor` function combines both the `tsfresh.extract_features` and the `tsfresh.transformers.feature_selector` methods together. Running different scenarios I have figured out that the NaN values are being generated from within the `tsfresh.extract_features` stage and that the `ValueError: Column must not contain NaN values: value` error is coming from within the `tsfresh.transformers.feature_selector` method. \r\n\r\nIt appears as though sktime's `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor` function has a `impute_function` parameter built into the `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor` function but when I try to use it, it doesn't seem like this parameter does anything. Also, looking at the tsfresh documentation I don't see any \"impute\" parameters within either the `tsfresh.extract_features` and the `tsfresh.transformers.feature_selector` methods.  Therefore, I am assuming this is an added parameter by the sktime team. Is this true?
