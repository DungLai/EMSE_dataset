I have been diving deeper into the repo to understand this better. Its still early, but if I understand this correctly, I think one potential pitfall would be the part of the validation window might overlap with the training since `initial_window` is decoupled from `window_length` in the `SlidingWindowSplitter`. \r\n\r\nLet's take a simple example (similar to what you have in your forecasting notebook). If the training data has 108 observations, `initial_window` is 50% of that as in your examples folder (54 observations), `window_length` is the default of 10, `fh` and `step_length` are set to default of 1, then\r\n\r\n* The training happens on indices 0 to 53.\r\n* But validation starts from using data from the beginning.\r\n  - So first temporal fold will use data from index 0 to 9 to make the next prediction (index 10). But indices 0 to 9 have already been used for training, so the same should not be used for validation as it will lead to a biased score.\r\n  - Similarly, the next fold will use data from index 1 to 10 to predict index 11. Again, index 1 to 10 have been used in training so should not be used for validation. \r\n  - This process repeats until you make a prediction for index 64 using data from index 54 to 63. That is the first truly unbiased fold.\r\n\r\n**Would it be better to have the temporal validation start from after the training index?**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/737469235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4064199116,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA2NDE5OTExNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4064199116","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-02T20:13:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4064199120,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwNjQxOTkxMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4064199120","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-02T20:13:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/738955817","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/521#issuecomment-738955817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/521","id":738955817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODk1NTgxNw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-04T18:51:54Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T18:52:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yes

@mloning @fkiraly @aiwalter @ngupta23\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm trying to migrate my codebase from `statsmodels` and `pmdarima` to `sktime`. There are some nuances that I have noticed:\r\n\r\n1. There is absolutely no difference between using `SlidingWindowSplitter` and `ExpandingWindowSplitter` when pass them to `ForecastingGridSearchCV`. New data is appended to `self._y` and `self._X` according to the selected splitter strategy (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/552#issuecomment-748685565, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/520#issuecomment-737325145), but: \r\n    - Training folds are still the same for both splitters.\r\n    - Training folds become larger and larger. It's OK for `ExpandingWindowSplitter`, but not for `SlidingWindowSplitter`. For `SlidingWindowSplitter`'s training folds should have the same length and move forward step by step and forget the earliest data points.\r\n\r\n2. I believe that `initial_window` and `start_with_window` parameters can be avoided in splitter classes to make them easier to understand (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/521, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/518). For example, I suggest the following signatures:\r\n    - `SlidingWindowSplitter(window_length, fh, step_length)`: fixed size training windows\r\n    - `ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_window_length, fh, step_length)`: expanding training windows\r\n\r\n    As you can see I was inspired by `pmdarima.model_selection`'s classes `SlidingWindowForecastCV` and `RollingForecastCV`.\r\n\r\n3. `ForecastingGridSearchCV` doesn't support a multi-step forecasting horizon (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/633).\r\n\r\n4. Also, it's good to add `cross_val_score` function in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection` that returns scores for each train/test folds. I found @aiwalter's evaluate function very similar to what I mean (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/657).\r\n\r\n5. The final suggestion is about update vs refit trade-off.\r\n    - For sliding window setting when the training fold has a fixed length there is only one option - call refit.\r\n    - For expanding window setting, from my point of view, the better approach is to use update functionality and refit as a fall-back option.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any of my suggestions sound interesting to you.
