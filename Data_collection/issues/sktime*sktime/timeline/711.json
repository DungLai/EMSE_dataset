@aiwalter Good questions -- it's less than a month old. I made `nb-strip-paths` for [example notebooks](https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-examples) for the [signac data management framework](https://signac.io/) but I think there are quite a few projects in the SciPy ecosystem with notebooks embedded in their docs that might find it handy. I'm using the hook with projects developed by my research lab but there aren't any other users yet.\r\n\r\n`nb-strip-paths` is meant to be a very small package with a singular purpose, and I think it is stable enough to use in your pre-commit hooks (especially since pre-commit hooks are usually pinned to a tag).\r\n\r\nHere's the snippet to add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  - repo: https://github.com/bdice/nb-strip-paths\r\n    rev: 'v0.1.0'\r\n    hooks:\r\n      - id: nb-strip-paths\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo strip the user paths, you may need to re-render the notebooks locally so that the absolute path to the repository matches _your_ path. For example, paths containing `/Users/mloning/.../sktime/abc` would not be stripped to `sktime/abc` if the current repository path is `/home/aiwalter/.../sktime/abc`. This is why it's helpful to have as a pre-commit hook, because it ensures that the user making a commit will strip their own paths from the outputs.\r\n\r\nThanks for the consideration, I'd be happy to hear your

\r\nIs there actually in general a way to strip ANY occurrence of my USERID in a notebook (and even other files)? In cells as well as error messages?\r\n\r\nRegarding my two examples, I would like to propose the following solutions. We could add additional argument to `nb-strip-paths` in order to...\r\n1. strip any path but only keep the file name only? (most secure)\r\n2. Strip any path before `site-packages` e.g.? (less secure)\r\n3. Just strip any USERID occurances in a notebook\r\n\r\nFor me its actually very important not to expose my USERID as I am using my company PC :) So I would prefer solution 1 in combination with 3 for `sktime`.

@mloning Sorry for the slow response, I didn't see your reply until now! I like your suggestions and have some follow-up questions before I work on the implementation.\r\n\r\n> 1. strip any path but only keep the file name only? (most secure)\r\n\r\nThis sounds prone to false positives but could be useful with some clarification. For example, strings like `2021/01/01` or `his/hers` or `alpha/beta/gamma` could be relative paths to a file. Similarly, regular expressions printed like `/abc/g` could appear to be absolute paths. This would need to be a top-priority rule if it is enabled (applied before the other rules that are more specific). Thus, I think you would want to detect _only_ absolute paths for potential stripping/truncation. You could also use something like `os.path.exists` to verify if it's really a path on the current system before stripping/truncating. What do you think of that?\r\n\r\n> 2. Strip any path before site-packages e.g.? (less secure)\r\n\r\nI like this proposed rule! This is a narrower scope and thus easier to apply without worrying about false positives. Any path-like string that includes `site-packages` as a substring could have its prefix (the part before `site-packages`) replaced with an ellipsis. This would look like `.../site-packages/more/stuff.py`. That seems very safe and unlikely to cause problems for readers.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, we could also have an option to change the paths to be UNIX-like with forward slashes. That would make it more likely that the output of a notebook executed on Windows, Linux, or Mac would be the same.\r\n\r\n> 3. Just strip any USERID occurances in a notebook\r\n\r\nIn this case, would you expect that the output of the cell below would be _empty_ after stripping the username? Or would you suggest a replacement such as the literal string `$USER`?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport getpass\r\nprint(getpass.getuser())\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think all 3 of your proposed rules are good, just depending on the circumstances. I could imagine that using all 3 rules together would be a desirable setting. The order of precedence would be:\r\n1. file-name-only (1 above)\r\n2. strip-site-packages-prefix (2 above)\r\n3. strip-repo-root-prefix (the current behavior)\r\n4. strip-username (3 above)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/792466996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdice","id":3943761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice","html_url":"https://github.com/bdice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdice/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4419216657,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQxOTIxNjY1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4419216657","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-08T05:10:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4419216661,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MTkyMTY2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4419216661","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-08T05:10:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4419216665,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQxOTIxNjY2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4419216665","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-08T05:10:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
