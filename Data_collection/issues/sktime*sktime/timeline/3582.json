@patrickzib, we were just looking at this and were wondering if it were just np.median/numba related or a wider issue with interference with the disk writing used in mmap.  One solution (from @dguijo) was to set \r\nfit = Parallel(n_jobs=self._threads_to_use, mmap_mode='w+')\r\n\r\nI'm just concerned that by making the mmap writable by all threads, they will interfere. This would happen if, for example, first process had not finished writing to the temp file before second looks to see if the mmap is there. It also requires changing a lot of files for a bug localised on median (it now seems, thanks to that thread). \r\n\r\nAnother solution is to just not make median a numba operation.

possible solutions:\r\n1. set the memory map to be writable everywhere.  mmap_mode='w+'. Dangerous and requires changes to a large number of files \r\n2. Dont use numba for finding the median until this is (hopefully) fixed. Some performance hit for what is not perhaps a common  use case: parallel run on large data (although I am doing this myself atm!).\r\n3. Always set arrays to be writeable in the median function, as @patrickzib suggests x.setflags(write=True). Seems a bit dangerous and would not really meet the user expectations? \r\n4. Clone data in median if passed a non writable array (@MatthewMiddlehurst). e.g.\r\n```\r\ndef median(X):\r\n    if X.flags.writeable:\r\n        return _median(X)\r\n    else:\r\n        X = X.copy()\r\n        X.setflags(write=True)\r\n        return _median(X)\r\n\r\n\r\n@njit(fastmath=True, cache=True)\r\ndef _median(X):\r\n    \"\"\"Numba median function for a single time series.\"\"\"\r\n    return np.median(X)\r\n``` \r\nIntroduces a time and memory overhead, but safer than (3) \r\n\r\nI dont like (1) as a widespread solution.
