Discussed in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/discussions/2451\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **anthonygiorgio97** April 13, 2022</sup>\r\nI was trying to do a Pipeline with transformers for both exogenous X (4 features) and endogenous y variable with a FeatureSelection(), a LogTransformer() and a Differencer() combined with a cross validation to tune Prophet (but the same happen with other algorithms). The difference operator must exclude the first index from both exogenous and endogenous variable (because I have specified this transformation both in ForecastingPipeline and TransformedTargetForecaster), but when I call the fit method this error raise: \r\n\r\n(time) indices of series 0 are not contained in index of series 0, extra indices are: DatetimeIndex(['2016-01-31'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n\r\nwhere 2016-01-31 is the first index. If I use a classic Detrender() the code work, but I want to try with the Differencer() operator.\r\n\r\nI am using sktime 0.11.0. This is the code I am using:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npipe_prophet = ForecastingPipeline(steps=[\r\n        (\"selection\", FeatureSelection(method = 'columns')),\r\n        (\"logX\",

OptionalPassthrough(LogTransformer())),\r\n            (\"differencer\", Differencer()),\r\n            (\"prophet\", Prophet(yearly_seasonality='auto'))\r\n        ]))  \r\n])\r\n\r\ncv = ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_window = len(train_model) - (N_cv_fold - 1) * step_cv - len(fh),\r\n                            start_with_window = True,\r\n                            step_length =

#2665 according to suggestions of @indinewton.\r\n\r\nAlso makes the following to `StackingForecaster`:\r\n\r\n* changes the test parameter settings such that one of the forecasters actually uses `X`. This should enable the test suite to catch bugs like #2665.\r\n* sets the capability tags correctly, dependent on the components. For the `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` tag, this should catch incompatible `X` indices at runtime and raise the standard error message.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
