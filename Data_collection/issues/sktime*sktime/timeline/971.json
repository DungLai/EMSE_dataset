See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nFixes #931\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nAdding the available information criteria (AIC, AICc, BIC, HQIC) for various forecasting algorithms.\r\nTBATS and BATS did not have a get_fitted_params method so I added it in the adapter there. Maybe we'll want to add additional parameters returned there. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nIs get_fitted_params the right place to return those? maybe a similar function e.g. get_fit_results is more appropriate.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for

See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n#877\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nCreates Sktime BaseObject class that inherits from scikit-learn's BaseEstimator and only adds the method for returning estimator tags.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nChanges in _base.py. The changes in _meta.py are just to comply with pydocstyle checks (so all of base is compliant).\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nStill need to set up the unit testing (want to apply applicable the unit tests that are currently applied to BaseEstimator except those dealing with fit functionality). \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for

Pick a “good first issue” to work on, see a collection [in this summary issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1147), or from [this list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue)\r\nsuggestion: pick something small with simple content to learn the “process”\r\n3. Feel free to attend the regular community collab sessions or one of the topic specific stand-ups and tech sessions (see schedule on slack)\r\n4. Once your first PR is merged and you’ve seen how things work, think about your regular time commitment. Optionally, continue attending the Friday community collaboration sessions and stand-ups; or, optionally, [apply for mentoring](https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/README.md)\r\n\r\n### introductory and user testing\r\n\r\n* work through the [sktime tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) and record feedback, you can post it in this issue #1447\r\n* work through user testing sheets for [forecasting](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_forecasting.ipynb) or [time series classification](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_TSC.ipynb), record feedback and send us your user testing sheet with code (e.g., attach to this issue)\r\n* open an issue with a time series related algorithm that you would like to see implemented or interfaced in `sktime`\r\n* work through the [installation instructions](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/installation.html) to install a development version of `sktime`. Record carefully things that are unclear or don't work as described, return the full feedback to us (e.g., in an issue).\r\n\r\n### contributors new to open source\r\n\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing module and class/function docstrings. Pick a file and start adding these. A good starting point are estimator algorithms, these should follow the general documentation style outlined in #1148 or the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). If you start, post the name of the estimator you are working on in #1148; when you open a PR, refer to the issue.\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing examples. Pick a file and start adding these. a good starting point are estimator algorithms, and time series classifiers, see #932 and #1148\r\n\r\nNOTE: #1148 and #932 are closed, but there are still modules without good docstrings. They are just no longer tracked by the issue, which covered the priority items only. So, feel free to go through the code base and help improve docstrings!\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium documentation and technical writing tasks\r\n\r\n* other smaller issues in the [documentation milestone](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/milestone/6)\r\n* the [user guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/user_guide.html) is incomplete. Help is appreciated - the best approach may be converting the [tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) in a well-written guide.\r\n* the [tutorial for time series classification](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) should be re-factored, in the style of the forecasting tutorial\r\n* extension templates for time series regression and time series annotation should be written. The current [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates) can be used as an extension template template.\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium python/coding tasks\r\n\r\n* current open small tasks with a \"recipe\": https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/3429\r\n* pick an unverified bug from the bugfixing board: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/18 and try to reproduce it. Post operating system, python version and (if relevant) package versions, and whether you can yes/no. Investigate further if the bug looks simple - but note that bugs can be anywhere between easy to very difficult to track down.\r\n* Pick an algorithm to implement or interface, according to the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). Possible choices are forecasters (univariate or multivariate), time series classifiers, time series regressors, annotators, distances, kernels - these can be existing feature requests, or new suggestions. We currently do not recommend transformers as they undergo refactoring.\r\n* implement `get_fitted_params` functionality in estimators where this is missing (currently most of them). Related issue for composite estimators: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1497\r\n\r\n### mid to longer term tasks\r\n\r\nFor contributing across a period of weeks or months, consider joining one of the major workstreams and weekly stand-ups on Fridays. Join the slack (see link in README) and say hello on the contributors channel.\r\n\r\nCurrent workstreams, overview here https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects?type=classic:\r\n* forecasting https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/3 and https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/25\r\n* deep learning, benchmarking https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/31\r\n* time series annotation, segmentation, change points https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/27\r\n* pipelines, pywatts integration https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/30\r\n* docs, maintenance, testing https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/26\r\n\r\n### challenging tasks\r\n\r\n✨ Your time to shine! ✨ \r\nTalk to a core dev before starting with these.\r\nAlso have a look at the roadmap #228\r\n\r\n* deep learning interfaces and models, see workstream above\r\n* `get_report` interface for model inspection #971\r\n* refactor/redesign: forecasting interface for stream update/prediction #982\r\n* help build/design new experimental module: distances/kernels\r\n* help build/design new experimental module: annotations (segmentation, change point detection, outlier detection)\r\n* help build/design new experimental module: sequence alignment\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-16T22:50:16Z","updated_at":"2021-10-16T22:50:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1497","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1497/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1497/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1497/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1497","id":1020514037,"node_id":"I_kwDOCVKAsc480871","number":1497,"title":"[ENH]

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n- [ ] Moving the `convert_y_to_keras` function in `BaseDeepClassifier` into a utils function\r\n- [x] Enable returning the `label_encoder` and `one hot encoder` to the user from `convert_y_to_keras` (it can be useful for the users in case they want to use it to encode other data / or to decode data later on)\r\n- [x] Add option to have multiple linear layers in output layer / different activation function. Also add the `use_bias` parameter to output layer. (simply as a customisation option to users, multiple linear layers are useful to create deeper networks depending on dataset / choice of activation function)\r\n- [x] option to choose optimiser (usually its Adam but just for customisation's sake we can give this as option as well). Also should allow specifying `lr` either within the optimiser or as parameter to the class itself.\r\n- [x] Accept parameter as input in `CNNClassifier` to specify `random seed`\r\n- [ ] Train/fit the model on GPU depending on users choice (maybe take an input parameter for this as well)\r\n- [x] Option to view / return the loss of fit (either as a graph or simply as a list / array )\r\n\r\n#####

partially addresses #971 by providing a default `get_fitted_params` interface, in `BaseEstimator`.\r\n\r\nBehaviour of `get_fitted_params` is as follows:\r\n\r\n* returns a `dict` with `str` keys, obtained from private `_get_fitted_params` and nested component `get_fitted_params`\r\n* component `get_fitted_params` are indexed by `[componentname]__[paramname]`, in analogy to `get_params`\r\n* raises a `NotFittedError` when called before estimator is fitted.\r\n\r\nDefault behaviour is also implemented:\r\n* `_get_fitted_params` retrievese all attributes ending in `_`, and presents them with keys where the ending `_` is removed\r\n* the default is compatible with the nesting interface\r\n\r\nA test is added to check the expected behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1193175285","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/971#issuecomment-1193175285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971","id":1193175285,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HHmj1","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-23T19:16:03Z","updated_at":"2022-07-23T19:16:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Addendum:
