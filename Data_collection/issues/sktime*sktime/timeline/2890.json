this this is really great. Some ideas to throw out there:\r\n\r\n- what would people's thoughts be on just running CI/CD tests on files changed until a particular PR is ready to merge, and then on the merge action we trigger the full CI/CD run? Might help with increasing iteration speed (seems like most bugs come up on files directly related to the PR) but ensures that a full QC check is done before the branch is merged. \r\n- also with regards to caching and how to store/access the file - it is actually possible to do this via [Github Actions directly](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows).  Not sure if that helps with this particular discussion, but seems like it might.
