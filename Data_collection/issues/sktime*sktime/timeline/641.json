A few question to better understand what you're trying to do: \r\n\r\n* Are you trying to forecast all series simultaneously, or only a single series using the information from the other series as exogenous variables?\r\n* In the sample data, what do the `day_1`, `day_2` columns represent? Are they some lagged values for some variable?\r\n\r\nFor forecasting, you probably don't need to worry about the nested format. We currently do not support multivariate forecasting directly if that's what you want to do, but there are ongoing development efforts to add it https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/pull/4.

I will clarify my problem.\r\n\r\n> Are you trying to forecast all series simultaneously, or only a single series using the information from the other series as exogenous variables?\r\n\r\nI am trying to forecast only one of the series using all other series AND the one I want to forecast. Let's say I want to forecast the serie 'FR_consumption_mean', I can use the information from 'day_1', 'day_2', etc... from the same and previous rows and the preivous values of 'FR_consumption_mean'.\r\n\r\n> In the sample data, what do the day_1, day_2 columns represent? Are they some lagged values for some variable?\r\n\r\nYes, more precisly they consist in the day of the month circularly encoded. I know this is irrelevant if I use a Time Series model. Let's just consider them as regular series for the sake of the example.\r\n\r\n> We currently do not support multivariate forecasting directly if that's what you want to do\r\n\r\nYes I am aiming at performing multivariate time series forecasting.
