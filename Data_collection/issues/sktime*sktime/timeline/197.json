this is helpful.\r\nI gather from your worksheet that there is *a single target time series*, that is, only one instance.\r\n\r\nFrom the looks of it, thus, your vanilla task is:\r\n- event modelling (because the \"condition\" happens rarely, and there are many days in-between without)\r\n- with exogeneous variables (= weather etc) that of are time series type\r\n\r\nThe standard approach for event modelling is temporal point processes, in this case you probably want one with an intensity function that is conditional on the past labels as well as the history of the exogeneous variables.\r\nYour typical \"nulls\" (= baselines) are homogenous Poisson process (there is a constant event risk and it doesn't depend on the exogeneous variables) and inhomogenous Poisson process (event risk varies over time, but unrelated to anything).\r\n\r\nThis type of learning task is currently not supported by sktime (event modelling requires the skpro interface which is currently under major re-work by @jesellier; *contributions are welcome!*). I'm also not sure whether there exists an off-shelf option for temporal point processes with exogeneity, though you might be able to build one manually using tensorflow probability or a Bayesian probabilistic programming language (both options sound tedious, other ideas/suggestions are welcome).\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be some easy options to reduce to time series classification/regression, since it doesn't look like the label series is strongly auto-correlated, and the exogeneous variables seem to auto-correlate in the order of months (difficult to tell since you cut off the plots after a couple weeks):\r\n- make monthly bins, and the label is the number of events in that month. Try to predict the number from the series in (probabilistic or deterministic) time series count regression.\r\n- pair up \"the past month of time series\" with the label for that day (for all days), consider this a time series classification problem where you predict hte label for the day from the past month series.\r\n- instead of the event 0/1 labels, consider the series of waiting times (time until next event). Pair up each waiting time with 1 month of series that leads up to the last event before the wait; try to predict the next waiting time by (probabilistic or deterministic) time series regression.\r\n- the same, but doing this for every day and predicting the waiting time until the next event\r\n\r\nFor evaluation, you have to keep in mind that the sample of prediction errors (samples of squared loss, classification loss, etc) is not an independent sample. For comparisons to the baselines and dummys, you may have to correct critical differences for auto-correlation. A common effective sample size correction is \"divide by 1+2*sum-over-acf\" (acf not including the lag-0-term), this is under assumption of stationary residuals.\r\n\r\nThe risk going down this route is perhaps loss of statistical power, i.e., you might not find any evidence that the weather etc relate to the event happening. Though of course that might be the case anyway (which is perhaps the key hypothesis to check for your
