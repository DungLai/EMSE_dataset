That would be a great thing to have for `sktime`.\r\n\r\nNow about something that's partly funny and partly not funny... \r\n\"NGboost\" is basically identical to the probabilistic boosting algorithm I proposed (earlier) in section 6.4 of my 2018 paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00753\r\nThe probabilistic prediction interface of the NGboost python package closely follows principles in the `sktime` companion package `skpro` (scikit-learn like probabilistic prediction), or the R package `mlr3proba`.\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably certain that Ng et al know of both the methodological paper and the software interface designs, but still don't cite them... that's not very nice.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we should develop `skpro` into the probabilistic scikit-learn that it was meant to be, but unfortunately it's currently without maintainer.
