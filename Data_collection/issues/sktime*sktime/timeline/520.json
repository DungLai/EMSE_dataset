The advantage is that you use more of the data to make predictions as the folds progress so some prefer that over a sliding window which limits the data used in each fold to a smaller number.

I think the misunderstanding is that there is a hyperpaeameter tuning part and a model training part. The sliding window is part of the tuning and training is usually done after with all training data and the found best params.\n\nI think the model can only learn from data that is has seen. When using a sliding window, old data is not shown to all models (at least in tuning mode, you might show all after tuning to really train it for inference). So if there is an important pattern in the old data that might appear in future again, a sliding window tuning can be a problem because you might select hyperparameters from a model that has not seen this old data. \r\n\r\nThis can be solved with using expanding window. The problem of an expanding window is however that most likely in empiricism, the models with the bigger training data will have the better performance (\"the bigger the better\"). So in expanding window there is always a bias to select hyperparams from a model that has seen more data. So both window splitter methods have pros and cons.\r\n\r\nAnyway I think it would be good to have an `ExpandingWindowSplitter`, so people would just have more choice based on what they prefer?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/748691021/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/749117437","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/520#issuecomment-749117437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/520","id":749117437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTExNzQzNw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-21T18:09:25Z","updated_at":"2020-12-21T18:09:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'll

@mloning @fkiraly @aiwalter @ngupta23\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm trying to migrate my codebase from `statsmodels` and `pmdarima` to `sktime`. There are some nuances that I have noticed:\r\n\r\n1. There is absolutely no difference between using `SlidingWindowSplitter` and `ExpandingWindowSplitter` when pass them to `ForecastingGridSearchCV`. New data is appended to `self._y` and `self._X` according to the selected splitter strategy (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/552#issuecomment-748685565, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/520#issuecomment-737325145), but: \r\n    - Training folds are still the same for both splitters.\r\n    - Training folds become larger and larger. It's OK for `ExpandingWindowSplitter`, but not for `SlidingWindowSplitter`. For `SlidingWindowSplitter`'s training folds should have the same length and move forward step by step and forget the earliest data points.\r\n\r\n2. I believe that `initial_window` and `start_with_window` parameters can be avoided in splitter classes to make them easier to understand (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/521, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/518). For example, I suggest the following signatures:\r\n    - `SlidingWindowSplitter(window_length, fh, step_length)`: fixed size training windows\r\n    - `ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_window_length, fh, step_length)`: expanding training windows\r\n\r\n    As you can see I was inspired by `pmdarima.model_selection`'s classes `SlidingWindowForecastCV` and `RollingForecastCV`.\r\n\r\n3. `ForecastingGridSearchCV` doesn't support a multi-step forecasting horizon (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/633).\r\n\r\n4. Also, it's good to add `cross_val_score` function in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection` that returns scores for each train/test folds. I found @aiwalter's evaluate function very similar to what I mean (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/657).\r\n\r\n5. The final suggestion is about update vs refit trade-off.\r\n    - For sliding window setting when the training fold has a fixed length there is only one option - call refit.\r\n    - For expanding window setting, from my point of view, the better approach is to use update functionality and refit as a fall-back option.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any of my suggestions sound interesting to you.
