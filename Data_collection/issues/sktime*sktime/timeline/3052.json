Somethig like pycaret, to install latest version can use this command: pip install --pre pycaret.\r\n\r\nQuestion: It is possible use \"--pre\" to latest version on github, and normal pip without \"--pre\" to latest stable version?\r\n\r\nexample: \r\n- sktime 0.13.0 --------> pip install sktime\r\n- sktime 0.13.1-dev ---> pip install --pre sktime \r\n\r\nmakes sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1188754455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"celestinoxp","id":41735311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzM1MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41735311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp","html_url":"https://github.com/celestinoxp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celestinoxp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1188776343","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3052#issuecomment-1188776343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3052","id":1188776343,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5G20mX","user":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-19T08:47:47Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T08:47:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Using
