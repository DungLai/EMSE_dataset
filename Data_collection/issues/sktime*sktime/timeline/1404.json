Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImplement `inv_var` method in `AutoEnsembleForecaster` that uses the inverse of variance of in-sample-fit errors as weights.  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThere are some points that need to be discussed further:\r\n\r\n* if `regressor` and `method` both `None`, which is the default. Now the default is `GradientBoostingRegressor`. \r\n* If they are provided both, raise a `ValueError`\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.
