fixes various incompatibilities of `sktime` with the recent sklearn 1.1.0 release:\r\n* fixes #2631 by moving the private `_check_param_grid` (which broke at sklearn 1.1.0) from sklearn 1.0.2 to sktime\r\n* fixes breakage caused by `DecisionTreeClassifier` of `sklearn` no longer accepting float for `max_depth`\r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the newly introduced upper sklearn bound to 1.2.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-12T19:47:20Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T19:47:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pycaret/pycaret/issues/2542","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pycaret/pycaret","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pycaret/pycaret/issues/2542/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pycaret/pycaret/issues/2542/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pycaret/pycaret/issues/2542/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/2542","id":1234330434,"node_id":"I_kwDODVRrfs5JkmNC","number":2542,"title":"[BUG]:
