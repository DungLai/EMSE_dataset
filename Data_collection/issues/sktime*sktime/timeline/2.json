Describe the issue linked to the documentation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTell us about the confusion introduced in the documentation.\r\n-->\r\nHey, first of all , i'd like to thank you guys for the contribution made to time series analyze. If you want to make sktime more popular, the documentation's readability&understand-ability is so important, especially the topic like data preparation. Since most of us are  familiar with the pandas and scikit, the transition is quit important for us. \r\n \r\nI have a multi-variate classification task.\r\nMy dataframe like below:\r\n![panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41810121/180977283-adca0d25-4e7a-4b6b-8aa9-5b34c34369eb.JPG)\r\nDue to some reason,some symbol lost some days records, like  #1 symblol has 1000 dates rows while #2 symblol only has 500 dates rows. I want use last 11 lags to classify current label's value. For example, for the first row, I will take the OHLC from the date 2014-10-30 to  2014-10-19, to predict the date of 2014-10-30's label. \r\nFirst of all, I convert the pandas(multi-index) to sktime's mtype(pd-multiindex)\r\ndata=pd.read_csv('etf_labels.csv',encoding='utf-8',parse_dates=[1])\r\ndata.sort_values(by=['symbol','date'], ascending=[True,True],inplace=True)\r\ndata.set_index(['symbol','date'],drop=True,inplace=True)\r\ny_train, y_test, X_train, X_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, X, test_size=30)\r\n# fit\r\nhc2.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\r\nValueError: y must be a np.array or a pd.Series, but found type: <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\r\n\r\nif change y_train to y_train.values\r\nhc2.fit(X_train, y_train.values)\r\nthen\r\nValueError: Mismatch in number of cases. Number in X = 1 nos in y = 2424\r\n\r\nfinally, i have read more than 2 days for the section of the data preparation, but still confused.\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTo enhance the document's readability and understand-ability, the detailed and complete example is preferable. \r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
