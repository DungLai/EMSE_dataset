(eg - maybe a topological ordering that constrains the ordering to a certain degree!) (not something that needs to be implemented now! Just throwing it out there as a design idea). \r\n\r\n### On implementations generally:\r\n- I think switching the permutation away from lists of strings to lists of 0-based indices would be easier to implement and to use?   I could see the strings being particularly confusing in the case that we are using the same estimator twice and people are unfamiliar with the generated naming system.  This is likely just a personal preference, but I thought it worth noting! :)\r\n\r\n### On specific implementations:\r\n- I tried to leave a few comments in both PRs.\r\n- My general feeling is that I have a slight preference for Franz's implementation, because I do agree that there are issues with having this logic in the base class. \r\n- However the clear drawback (in my mind) of Franz's implementation is that wrapping the pipeline in yet another layer of estimator feels somehow confusing and not user friendly.  Instead as a user I would expect step order I could tune without the need for yet another layer to be added.  Perhaps this is just personal taste in this matter, but I am concerned about what this might look like if we begin to have multiple problems we solve this way  - then the nesting could get out of hand?\r\n- I also would be interested in verifying that all the tuning logic still works as expected now that there is another layer.  eg if I wanted to tune something else in the original pipe would - would we now need to tune permute.pipe.tunable_attribute (rather than pipe.tunable_attribute?  Would be worth looking more into how the current tuning workflows change if we add on a `Permute` layer. \r\n- But out of the two my feeling is that #3689 has a better chance of working out of the box and appeals to me more from a design perspective, so if it comes down to choosing one or the other that would be my preference.\r\n\r\n### Possible Suggestion:\r\n- I personally this would be a great problem to solve via composition rather than by inheritance or by adding in extra layers of estimators. \r\n- How I would envision this working is that the user can optionally pass a composable object to their pipeline which overrides the base logic for fetching steps and could take care of the logic of handling permutations.\r\n- Kind of the mix of the two solutions in that the logic of how to handle composable components would probably live in HeterogenousMetaEstimator but the actual logic is totally separated from it, and leave open the possibility for more variety in the future! \r\n- If this is of interest - I could potentially mock up a solution. \r\n- I would still lean towards observing that Franz's solution does look like it would work and could be merged after verifying the additional issues I highlighted. \r\n\r\nCheers!

In the following, I add a few comments and thoughts about both PRs\r\n\r\n* With regard to user-friendliness, I think your solution is easier to understand and easier to use because nesting can look very complicated. In contrast, your solution would enable such a tuning by only specifying a parameter. However, I suppose that this is a more advanced feature. Thus, I think it would be okay to use the delegator solution.\r\n* With regard to maintenance, I suppose that the delegator solution is easier to maintain since the pipelining and the permutation functionality are separated. \r\n* With regard to the power of the solution, I suppose the delegator solution could be more powerful. E.g. think about the following example: You have an ensemble approach with two different models. For each model, a different order in the preprocessing might be optimal. This should be easily possible with the delegator approach by using two nested pipelines for each model that are used as an input for the ensemble. \r\n\r\nBased on these three points, I currently would slightly prefer the delegator solution (#3689).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1314085522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"benHeid","id":9725296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjUyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9725296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid","html_url":"https://github.com/benHeid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benHeid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7806291499,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5SEBxTzwAAAAHRSo4r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7806291499","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-14T17:03:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7806291509,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5SEBxTzwAAAAHRSo41","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7806291509","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-14T17:03:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1314217448","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3439#issuecomment-1314217448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3439","id":1314217448,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5OVV3o","user":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-14T18:45:49Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T18:45:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Ok
