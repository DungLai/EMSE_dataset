models on disk.\r\n\r\nWe have tested `cloudpickle` to understand whether it's serialization of a pointer or the actual data. The test result suggests that the size of pickle file increases when size of y is increasing hence it should be storing the actual data instead of just a pointer. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93530957/195491606-ac734d71-6f41-49cd-a30b-3bc18c63cc8d.png)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, another piece of evidence suggests that `cloudpickle` stores the pd.Series is that `self._y` can be accessed after unpickling in a completely separate session.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93530957/195493827-7e34ac84-baa9-4892-afb0-7ebd0b1c52d5.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, [documentation](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle#overriding-pickles-serialization-mechanism-for-importable-constructs) of `cloudpickle` stated that:\r\n> An important difference between cloudpickle and pickle is that cloudpickle can serialize a function or class by value, whereas pickle can only serialize it by reference.\r\n\r\nDo let us know if you have any other thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1276981212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasmineliaw","id":93530957,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZMrTQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93530957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw","html_url":"https://github.com/jasmineliaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7577009579,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5T1NPezwAAAAHDn_2r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7577009579","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-13T03:36:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7577009584,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5T1NPezwAAAAHDn_2w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7577009584","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-13T03:36:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1277440289","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3580#issuecomment-1277440289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3580","id":1277440289,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5MJDEh","user":{"login":"topher-lo","id":46541035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46541035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/topher-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-13T11:11:39Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T11:13:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fkiraly

My intended use case for having parquet as storage for y and X is to speed up global forecasting inference without sacrificing too much on memory. It would be an immense performance boost at inference time if we stored the table with past lags / rolling stats in memory precomputed. In the case of global forecasting, efficient storage of the internal memory `y` and `X` lagged structure features matters more. Indeed, assuming constant T timestamps, N entities, K lags, and J rolling stats, the dimension of this precomputed table will be: T x (K x (J + 1)).
