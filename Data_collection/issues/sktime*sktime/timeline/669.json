In which case it might be appropriate to primarily write it up as a research paper, \"correcting interval sampling bias in time series forest classifier importance curves\" or sth like that?\r\n\r\nSince if you just fix it in the code:\r\n* the implementation might no longer be 1:1 congruent with the algorithm described in the paper (of which the class is supposed to be an \"implementation mirror\" i.m.o.)\r\n* your (potentially great) idea would go unnoticed, unpublished, unreviewed\r\n\r\n@TonyBagnall, what is your

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #669\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged.

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n--> An option has been provided for the user if they want to normalize the importance curve by considering the fact that different time indices occur in the different numbers of intervals. Some cases might not require them to do so, as rightly pointed out by @TonyBagnall and @MatthewMiddlehurst and hence it is user-dependent.\r\nI do this by assigning two variables: normalise_option ('False' initially) and normalise_type (I will be building on it later so I have just initialised it for now).\r\nBased on the preference stored in normalise_option, user can either fis_norm or fis in return. fis_norm will be obtained by dividing the fis by fis_count that is obtained by empirical value addition as @aabanda suggests. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n--> Nope\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nJust the edits in the code. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n--> For future: I think we can add more kinds of normalizations. Apart from just based on count, we can have normalization based on maximum occurrence of intervals or mean occurrence in intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/768/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/810981038","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/669#issuecomment-810981038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/669","id":810981038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDk4MTAzOA==","user":{"login":"Aexousia","id":34106768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTA2NzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34106768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia","html_url":"https://github.com/Aexousia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aexousia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-31T11:10:06Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T11:10:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, I added an option for normalizing the importance curve if the user needs that given the objective and dataset that they might be working on based on what @aabanda, @TonyBagnall, and @MatthewMiddlehurst  suggested.\r\nI also think that we could include more types of normalization as options if we are at it. Sometimes when the range of the time series dataset might be very large, the users might need normalization based on the maximal value among all the empirical counts. Additionally, we can also normalize based on the average or median. These choices could be provided in a separate variable 'normalise_type' that will take in the input once users set 'normalise_option' as 'True'.
