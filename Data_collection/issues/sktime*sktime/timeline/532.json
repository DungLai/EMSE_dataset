Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n#532\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nI've tried to round out the data container functionality to go between Pandas multi-indexed DataFrames, NumPy 3d arrays and Sktime nested DataFrame. I've also tried to have the conversions from nested to other structures (multi-indexed of NumPy 3d arrays) handle mixed DataFrames with some nested and some primitive columns. \r\n\r\nAlso started on function nested_dataframes_equal for checking if two nested DataFrames (can be mix of nested an primitive columns) are equal.\r\n\r\nAdded functions:\r\nfrom_multi_index_to_3d_numpy\r\nfrom_3d_numpy_to_multi_index\r\nfrom_multi_index_to_nested\r\nfrom_nested_to_multi_index\r\n_is_nested_structure\r\n_make_column_names\r\nnested_dataframes_equal\r\n\r\nUpdated functions:\r\n_get_column_names to use _make_column_names.\r\nis_nested_dataframe to account for mix of primitive\r\nand nested column structures.\r\nfrom_nested_to_3d_numpy to work with mix of\r\nprimitive and nested column structures and\r\nhandle nested structures\r\nwith  np.ndarrary or pd.Series.\r\n\r\nOther changes are to formatting or docs.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nThis is my first time contributing to a project, so in addition to feedback on the functionality I've added, let me know anything that is out of sorts from a logistical standpoint in terms of contributing (I've tried to follow along with contrib guidelines).\r\n\r\nI've also got a first draft of a function called nested_dataframes_equal to compare two potentially nested DataFrames for equality. Need to add check of columns and indexes (along with indexes of nested data structures), but interested in initial feedback. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
