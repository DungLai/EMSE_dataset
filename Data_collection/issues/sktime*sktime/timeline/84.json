use sklearn/RidgeClassifierCV in our experiments for 'smaller' datasets).  I can add a separate sktime classifier class to link the transform and the sklearn classifier.\r\n* This implementation can handle univaraite and multivariate time series, but not (yet) variable-length time series directly.\r\n* As ROCKET relies on Numba, and Numba only understands NumPy (not pandas), this code uses an unavoidable 'hack', in that the input DataFrame is (and must be) converted into a NumPy array internally.  (Almost certainly, this conversion will break for variable-length time series.)\r\n* The implementation is preliminary, in particular in relation to multivariate time series, which we are still investigating.\r\n* This should produce equivalent results (including timings) to our current published implementation (it is fundamentally very similar), but I have not yet tested this extensively.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/204/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/620666027","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/84#issuecomment-620666027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/84","id":620666027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDY2NjAyNw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T15:07:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T15:07:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closed as we included numba dependency with rocket transformer.
