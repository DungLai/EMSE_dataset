My `build_tools/requirements.txt` does not look like the one posted above (see down here). To reproduce this, I did the following:\r\n\r\n* Created a `conda` environment named `sktime` with Python 3.8 and `pip`\r\n* Followed the steps [here](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/get_involved/contributing.html#git-and-github-workflow)\r\n* In the `build_tools/requirements.txt` as follows, changed `fbprophet>=0.7.1` to `prophet>=1.0.0`. \r\n* Ran `pip install -r build_tools/requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nThe first time it tried to install `prophet` it failed, then installed `numpy` and then `pip` successfully installed `prophet` again. Note: in this way, the `pystan` version installed is `pystan-2.19.1.1`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncython>=0.29.0\r\ndeprecated>=1.2.13\r\ndtw_python>=1.1.5\r\nesig==0.9.7\r\nfbprophet>=0.7.1 -->

Reference Issues\r\nAttempts to fix #1631.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nSpecific to prophet:\r\n\r\n* Set upper limit on pystan version\r\n* Moved from `fbprohet>=0.7.1` to `prophet>=1.0.0`.\r\n\r\nMore generally:\r\n\r\n* groups dependencies so it's clear when each dependency is used (mirrors #1620):\r\n  * `core dependencies` for the base sktime\r\n  * `all_extras` for extensions\r\n  * `dev` for contributors\r\n* Relaxed constraint on all libraries except `numpy` (see #1787 and #1794)\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nWe should test this across multiple OS and Python versions. I could test macOS with Python 3.8.12\r\n\r\n#### Other notice\r\n\r\nWhen `pip install -r build_tools/requirements.txt` is run, packages are collected; then **wheels are built**. When doing so, **`prophet` wheel fails to build because it is build before numpy is installed**. `pip` then installs the other dependencies and `prophet` too, but without building the wheel and using `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> Full log</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install -r build_tools/requirements.txt\r\nCollecting deprecated>=1.2.13\r\n  Using cached

Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nFixes #1631 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
