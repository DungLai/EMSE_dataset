seems to be two parts to this bug that I have identified. The first seems to be a problem in pandas. To find the relative horizon the cutoff is taken away from the absolute horizon. To achieve this they are first converted through `to_period()`. The type of output from `to_period` is a `Period` for the cutoff timestamp and a `PeriodIndex` for the `DateTimeIndex`. I suspect the differing types cause an issue in pandas. When one of these is taken from the other, the interval is multiplied by the frequency, hence with 2 hours you get [0, 4, 8, ...] etc. With a frequency of 3H this becomes [0, 9, 18, ...]. However, if I manually create both the cutoff and absolute horizon as `PeriodIndex` then the result is [0, 2, 4, ...] which is the expected result for this part. \r\n\r\nThe second problem is in the `_coerce_duration_to_int` where it takes the output of the above and just extracts the integers seemingly ignoring the frequency. I haven't investigated this too thoroughly yet. I will work on fixing this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1022360851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eenticott-shell","id":93924843,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZkt6w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93924843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell","html_url":"https://github.com/eenticott-shell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1022548648","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1935#issuecomment-1022548648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1935","id":1022548648,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc488tqo","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-26T19:53:32Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T19:53:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@eenticott-shell, could you kindly post minimally reproducing code for the issues?

Explain your changes.\r\nWithin the forecasting horizon methods `to_relative` and `to_absolute_int` coerces absolute and cutoff to the same type to avoid an error that can occur in `pandas` where time differences are multiplied by the frequency multiple (i.e. 2H multiplies the difference by 2).

while using a dataset that has a datetime index with a frequency of 10T (separated by 10 minutes), the ForecastingHorizon is setting the relative values to increments of 100. This leads to `n_periods` being set as 100 times the actual length `X.shape[0]` of the exogenous variable used in `predict`. This causes a `ValueError` to be raised by the Arima package `X array dims (n_rows) != n_periods`.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Download the dataset `energy_data.csv` from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00374/).\r\n2. Set the index as `date`.\r\n3. Separate X and y.\r\n4. Set `dates` as the index of `X` convert as a `datetime`.\r\n5. Convert `dates` to PeriodIndex with the appropriate frequency.\r\n6. Initialize `ForecastingHorizon`, followed by fitting and predicting with `AutoArima`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../energydata_complete.csv\")\r\ndata = data[:200]\r\ndata.set_index(\"date\", drop=True, inplace=True)\r\nX = data.copy()\r\ny = X.pop(\"Appliances\")\r\n\r\ndates = pd.to_datetime(X.index)\r\nfreq = pd.infer_freq(dates)\r\ndates = dates.to_period(freq=freq)\r\n\r\nX.index = dates\r\ny.index = dates\r\n\r\nfh_ = ForecastingHorizon(y.index[150:200], is_relative=False)\r\n\r\na_clf = sktime_arima.AutoARIMA(start_p=2, start_q=2, max_p=5, max_q=5)\r\nclf = a_clf.fit(X=X[:150], y=y[:150])\r\ny_pred_sk = clf.predict(fh=fh_, X=X[150:200])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that `n_periods = int(fh.to_relative(self.cutoff)[-1])` would set `n_periods` to 50 as there are 50 increments of datetime instances separated by 10 minutes being passed to `predict`. However `fh.to_relative(self.cutoff)` ends up producing this:\r\n\r\n`Int64Index([ 100,  200,  300,  400,  500,  600,  700,  800,  900, 1000, 1100,\r\n            1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200,\r\n            2300, 2400, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2800, 2900, 3000, 3100, 3200, 3300,\r\n            3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 3900, 4000, 4100, 4200, 4300, 4400,\r\n

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nConvert `PeriodIndex` `absolute` to `DatetimeIndex`, as well as `cutoff` and `start` `Period` to `Timestamp` before taking the difference between the two.\r\n\r\nThis circumvents the following bug in pandas:\r\n```\r\nperiods = pd.period_range(start=\"2021-01-01\", periods=3, freq=\"2H\")\r\nperiods - periods[0]\r\nOut: Index([<0 * Hours>, <4 * Hours>, <8 * Hours>], dtype = 'object')\r\n[v - periods[0] for v in periods]\r\nOut: Index([<0 * Hours>, <2 * Hours>, <4 * Hours>], dtype='object')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBug report scripts were added as explicit test cases and should be replaced later with lightweight unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
