code is here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/sktime/forecasting/compose/_reduce.py\r\n\r\nThe current code isn't great because:\r\n* convoluted class hierarchy makes it hard to follow and extend\r\n* inefficient for-loops for data transformations \r\n\r\nI suggest we break up the code into simpler classes using stand-alone functions for the data transformations. \r\n\r\n@SebasKoel has done some work already here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/390 (see e.g. `create_lag_matrix`) \r\n\r\nI suggest we start with the reduction to the simpler tabular regression setting (basically scikit-learn, i.e. transforming time series into 2d numpy array) and work on the time series regression setting (3d numpy) once the tabular setting is working. \r\n\r\nWhat we want to be able to do in the end is something like this: \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.all import * \r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\ny_train, y_test, X_train, X_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, X)\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)\r\n\r\nregressor = RandomForestRegressor()\r\nforecaster = ReducedRegressionForecaster(regressor, window_length=10, strategy=\"recursive\")\r\nforecaster.fit(y_train, X_train)\r\ny_pred = forecaster.predict(fh, X=X_test)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we not only create lagged values for the target series (`y`) but also the exogenous data (`X`). We then pass all lagged values in the required 2d numpy array to scikit-learn regressor.
