agree, I added the interface. This could be easier for users, e.g. only a`MiniRocket` class. This would require according check functions for univariate / multivariate / unequal length checks in the `fit(X)` and `transform(X)`. \r\n\r\nPseudocode:\r\n```\r\nclass MiniRocketNew\r\n...\r\ndef _fit(X):\r\n    if is_unequal_length(X):\r\n        return MiniRocketMultivariateVariable.fit(X)\r\n    elif is_multivariate(X):\r\n        return MiniRocketMultivariate.fit(X)\r\n    else:\r\n        return MiniRocket.fit(X)\r\n```\r\n+ _transform() would need to validate that X has the same properties as in _fit()\r\nan alternative could be input flags.\r\n\r\nThere is however the issue, that based upon the `_tags`, the data gets converted to the `X_inner_mtype`. E.g. For the unequal length, the `\"X_inner_mtype\": \"numpy3D\"`, should fail.

the numba signatures are different for each function, e.g. `minirocket` taking the 2D array, `minirocket_multivariate` a `numpy3D` input, minirocket_multivariate_variable taking a flattened multivariate 2D `[n_dimensions, sum(length_series(i) for i in n_instances)]` array with information of the series length in an extra `[n_instances]` array.\r\n\r\nWhile we could keep just the three versions of numba in one .py file, I am not sure how to adjust the `_tags` to all three
