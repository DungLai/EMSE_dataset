Also includes examples with pytest and pre-commit within PyCharm\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nContributes to part 2 of #1635 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nDocumented example of installing sktime on Windows, specifically using PyCharm and Anaconda with extensive screenshots to guide new users. While PyCharm is used as the IDE, instructions are separated out so that just the environment instructions can be followed (i.e. Section 2) without need for PyCharm, if preferred.  \r\n\r\nThe notebook is in examples/windows_installation.ipynb and the other files that have been added are screenshots that are used within the notebook. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nNo code introduced has been introduced but I'm not sure if this is the correct place for it - it may be better in the \\docs but I'm not sure how best to include the images and have used a notebook as a first pass. Also, please comment on whether the instructions are informative or if you have suggestions for any changes\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1640/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/978409254","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1635#issuecomment-978409254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1635","id":978409254,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc46UVcm","user":{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-24T23:00:45Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T23:00:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It took longer than planned but please see #1640 for my first pass at this","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/978409254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/980556035","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1635#issuecomment-980556035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1635","id":980556035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc46chkD","user":{"login":"amrith-shell","id":83223497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjIzNDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83223497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell","html_url":"https://github.com/amrith-shell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrith-shell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-27T12:13:01Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T12:13:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"In terms of the 2nd task of re-organizing the documentation/developer guide, I took the approach of categorizing various sections of the documentation and created a hierarchy/ decision tree of the documentation structure.

the Windows build requirements and installation instructions to be up to date with latest Visual Studio code. Also updated instructions to ensure that the conda environment set up works from a fresh install to get an editable developer version.\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nContributes to part 1 of #1635 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nIt updates the Windows section of the development installation guide. Specifically it updates the instructions for installing Visual Studio Code for 2022 and clearly shows which components are needed. It also updates the sequence of commands to obtain a working conda environment for sktime development stating how to resolve some common dependency issues as well as some ways that users can check that their installation has worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nThe clarity of the new instructions. Is there anything else that should be addressed? Does the image I've added in the Build Tools for Visual Studio Tools section load correctly?\r\n\r\nI have kept as much of the old instructions as I could, for example attempting to install via `python setup.py install` outside an environment, however I couldn't get this to work myself. Should I remove this and only have instructions for an anaconda environment? Thus introducing a new requirement for windows installation, or keep it as is, as it may work for some people.\r\n \r\n#### Any other _comments?_\r\nI plan to make further changes to the order of the installation instructions once the restructuring in #1635 part 2 has taken place. This PR is simply to update the windows instructions so that they should work.
