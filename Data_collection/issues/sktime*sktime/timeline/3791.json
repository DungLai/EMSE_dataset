for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nRefers to #3769 .\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nThis PR adds an unequal length, multivariate time series https://github.com/angus924/minirocket/blob/main/code/minirocket_multivariate_variable.py.\r\nThe MinirocketMultivariateVariable works similar to the MinirocketMultivariate, however can process multivariate timeseries with variable length, therefore requires an own Sktime interface. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nAs this is my first contribution, give a broad feedback:\r\n- if the class is implemented correctly, and has sufficient tests\r\n- if the formatting is correct (check doc strings)\r\n- is the doc update sufficient (did not find more for other models)\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- also updated the notebook, where the `RidgeClassifierCV` has a deprecation warning of `normalizer=True`\r\n- \r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. (Python 3.10 conda env, wsl2 )\r\n- [x]The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3786/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1331096184","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3791#issuecomment-1331096184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3791","id":1331096184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5PVup4","user":{"login":"michaelfeil","id":63565275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTY1Mjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63565275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelfeil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-29T18:14:57Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T18:14:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should be resolved with the merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1331096184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"michaelfeil","id":63565275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTY1Mjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63565275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelfeil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7915237832,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5WbW7fzwAAAAHXyPHI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7915237832","actor":{"login":"michaelfeil","id":63565275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTY1Mjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63565275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelfeil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfeil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-29T18:14:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
