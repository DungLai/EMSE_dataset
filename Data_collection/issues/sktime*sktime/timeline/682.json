API is for cross-sectional learning, forecasting and other time series tasks are considerably different to cross-sectional learning. I think it makes sense to have a different interface for different tasks. For more general design principles behind sktime, see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04938). The rationale for the forecasting API is also discussed in more details in this [enhancement proposal](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/master/steps/01_forecasting_api/01_forecasting_api.md). Feedback is very welcome! \r\n\r\nMaking estimators fully compatible with the scikit-learn interface also requires changing the `predict` method by the way, so you could do something like `fbprophet` does, but I don't think it's very intuitive, and it uses the same symbols, but changes the meaning of the symbols. In scikit-learn, `X` is cross-sectional data whereas in sktime, it'd be time series data. One also has to be careful to apply functionality from the cross-sectional setting to forecasting, because some assumptions do not hold (e.g. rows do not represent i.i.d. samples). \r\n\r\nsktime is still interoperable with scikit-learn through the reduction interfaces (e.g. `ReducedRegressionForecaster`). Why doesn't that work in the above example? What other functionality do you have in mind that doesn't work with the current interface?
