I looked at the notebook and figured something out, so I wrote a small helper function (more on that in a moment) to solve my problem.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, consider if we have a numpy array declared as a = np.array([1,2,3,4]), representing some time series sampled at regular (arbitrary) intervals. So this instance as a shape of (4,). Usually, we have a number of such series, say 100, so the resulting collection would have a shape of (100,4); 100 representing the number of instances, 4 representing the (temporal) length of each instance. This is a pretty common way to find or use custom data for time series analysis. So in a nutshell, I'm looking for a simple and direct way to use data in such a structure/form with sktime. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I hacked together a small helper function to help solve my problem. Would you like me to share it or perhaps create a pull request?\r\n\r\nRegards","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/578965726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"madarax64","id":4976654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzY2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4976654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64","html_url":"https://github.com/madarax64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madarax64/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2983499555,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk4MzQ5OTU1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2983499555","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-27T21:38:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2983499557,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5ODM0OTk1NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2983499557","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-27T21:38:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/579129165","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/217#issuecomment-579129165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/217","id":579129165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTEyOTE2NQ==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-28T08:13:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T08:13:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'm happy to take a look at your helper function!

Explain your changes.\r\n* Adds 3d numpy arrays as supported input types for the series-as-features setting (classification, regression, etc) via `coerce_numpy` and `coerce_pandas` kwarg in input validation functions, so estimators can decide internally which representation to use and which representation to return (transformers)\r\n* Changes to algorithms to directly handle numpy input, otherwise added `coerce_to_pandas` flag to input checks\r\n* Added tests for 3d numpy input to all series-as-feature estimators, including classifiers, regressors and transformers \r\n\r\n#### Additional changes\r\n* Adds `sktime.classification.all` and `sktime.regression.all` for easy importing\r\n* Deprecates `tabularize` in favour of `from_nested_to_2d_numpy` for consistency\r\n* Bug fix in `RandomIntervalSpectralForest` to achieve random state consistency\r\n* Handling of empty results in unit tests to fix flaky tests for `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor`\r\n* Added decorator for raising deprecation warning\r\n* Added unit tests for unit test framework \r\n* Minor formatting changes\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
