is a can of worms...\r\n\r\nWhy: this is a different \"kind\" of prediction, essentially a third option next to deterministic and probabilistic supervised prediction or forecast.\r\n\r\nPrediction intervals can hence appear in any case when the predicted object has a continuous/numeric type.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge there is no package that has a clean interface for prediction forecasts, but what comes closest is ... \r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/skpro\r\n... which is currently looking for a maintainer or v2 re-design.\r\n\r\nAs a hack, one could make PI boundaries part of a dict return object, similar to mean/var in sklearn, but it wouldn't account for:\r\n- the possibility of producing PI boundaries at different levels of prediction confidence (e.g., 75%, 90%)\r\n- deriving these from fully probabilistic predictions\r\n- evaluation via losses specific for PI\r\n\r\nAs a slightly less hacky option, one could attach traits to each method about which kinds of predictions it can make: PI mean/var; PI, quantile-based, fully probabilistic, etc.\r\nThe return object of predict would be a dictionary with pre-defined fields, and there would be input fields to specify the quantiles one want for PI.\r\n\r\nAnything \"nicer\" (e.g., along the lines of MLJ's ontology of det/prob/etc) would require an interface redesign and/or further work on skpro, in my opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/517349716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/517350200","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/97#issuecomment-517350200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/97","id":517350200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzM1MDIwMA==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T15:59:59Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T15:59:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@frthjf

container**\r\n* pmdarima assumes for y (target) array of shape=(n_obs,) and for X (exogeneous) array of shape=(n_obs, n_features), crucially with time series observations in rows. \r\n* by contrast, we have a nested pandas Series or DataFrame, with rows representing iid samples, i.e. in the classical forecasting setting a single row, and columns representing different kinds of measurements (i.e. features), the format is nested because each cell may contain no longer only primitive types but also arrays or pandas Series of shape=(n_obs,), \r\n* we chose this data container because it allows to have a unified interface for different time series related learning settings including forecasting, but also panel/longitunidal data settings such as time series classification/regression or supervised/panel forecasting.\r\n\r\n**Forecasting horizon**\r\n* we allow the forecasting horizon to be an array with the steps ahead, not only the number of steps ahead (`n_periods`), allowing for gaps e.g. predicting only the third and fifth step ahead with `fh = np.array([3, 5])`, may not make a difference for ARIMA, but will do for reduction strategies\r\n\r\n**Fit method**\r\n* some methods already require the forecasting horizon in `fit` (e.g. non-dynamic reduction to time series regression where one time series regressor is fitted for each step of the forcasting horizon)\r\n* pmdarima currently takes the forecasting horizon only in `predict`\r\n* should we allow the forecasting horizon when passed in `fit` to be then changed in `predict`?\r\n\r\n**Update method**\r\n* pmdarima adds the new data to the old data (kept in the model) and refits the model using the previously fitted params as start params,\r\n* is the new data always in the future?\r\n* alternatively, one could use the new data to update the already fitted parameters using Kalman smoothing/filtering, ideally only the new data is used so that the data seen in training does not have to be stored in the model? \r\n\r\n**In-sample forecasts**\r\n* pmdarima has a separate method for in-sample forecasts\r\n* currently, we don't have a good way to do in-sample forecasts, our forecasting horizon is currently relative to the end of the series seen in training, allowing negative values would perhaps be one option?\r\n\r\n**Forecast confidence intervals**\r\n* pmdarima returns intervals from `predict` method via an optional kwarg changing the output of predict \r\n* should we return intervals from a separate method instead to have a stable method signature for `predict`?\r\n* related to design discussion on probabilistic forecasting #97 \r\n\r\n**Composition**\r\n* Pipelines for target variable vs `TransformedTargetForecaster`

bit late to the party so please if ignore if no longer applicable as already closed. I might lack context of the wider project here, but from what I understand it seems indeed like a type of problem that the skpro API tried to address. I'd like to think of the problem as ['speculative API' problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution) where the issue is that we try to define an intermediate return object without knowing how it is going to be used. In skpro, the object was a distribution and the issue is that the user might be interested in something as complex as the pdf() but might just as well only care about the mean. The return type somehow has to represent mean, pdf() and any other conceivable property of interest but ideally only the ones that are actually used to avoid a lot of wasted computation. Here, we have a similar problem where the general return object are intervals ranging from simple boundery values to something like get_interval(confidence=0.9).\r\n\r\nIn skpro, the solution paradigm to this issue was lazy execution; the computation of mean, pdf() etc. is described but only executed when accessed and actually used. This has the problem that one still needs to define how all the potential properties of interest would be computed for each an every model, so the computional burden of full eager execution is transformed into an implementational burden that is not very user friendly. \r\n\r\nThe other option is something like a predictive API where you say, well, we assume most people are only interested in alpha value intervals, so let's hack that in and if it turns out people actually care about other things then we have to go back and implement something else (I think that's the way to go as a quick fix)\r\n\r\nNow, I believe there is a better way to solve this because we shouldn't be forced to speculate about what is actually needed if we could look at the entire computation ahead of the execution of each steps and truncate intermediate objects that are not needed for the end result (a bit like in Tensorflow's compute graph). Unfortunately, as @fkiraly recognized, this is a true can of worms and would require a huge amount of work. In any case, maybe this perspective helps with the further development.

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nIncludes:\r\n\r\n* `ThetaForecaster` which implements the [Theta method](https://robjhyndman.com/papers/Theta.pdf).\r\n* Unit tests for `ThetaForecaster`.\r\n* A new dataset in `datasets.load_airline` - the Box/Jenkins airline passengers dataset. I thought this provided a clearer example of simple, univariate, seasonal data than some of the other datasets currently in sktime.\r\n* New interface in `BaseForecaster` to enable prediction intervals to be calculated: `prediction_errors`. Currently this has only been implemented for `ThetaForecaster`. Running this method for any other forecaster will raise a `NotImplementedError`.\r\n* Alternatively, prediction intervals may also be obtained by calling `predict()` and providing one or many confidence levels. This will cause the method to return a tuple of predictions and errors, instead of just predictions.\r\n* A `plot()` convenience method for forecasters. As well as plotting the forecasts (optionally alongside any training/test data), it will also plot prediction intervals if available for that forecaster.\r\n* A new notebook, `simple_forecasting.ipynb`, to demonstrate all of the above.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.

I've opted for a different approach though, of just doing the bare minimum and calculating the forecast point errors and returning this as a single series. It's then trivial to apply this to your forecasts to obtain the intervals. This is what the new `plot()` method does under the hood. I think it should still be fairly easy to interface with some of these other packages even with this different approach but please let me know if you disagree.\r\n\r\nFYI, `prediction_errors` supports the calculation of producing PIs at different confidence levels, something that was discussed in #97. It also allows each forecaster to define its own methods for PI calculations. I didn't attempt to implement this for any of the other forecasters as this could be quite a lot of code for some of them (in the case of ETS forecasting, I believe some models don't even have a known formula - for this reason I implemented the interface in a way that makes it optional). \r\n\r\nI thought about merging in the new notebook with the existing forecasting notebook, but wasn't sure how to best make them fit together. I'm happy to take a steer on this if you'd prefer me to put all the forecasting stuff in a single notebook before merging the PR.\r\n\r\n# PR checklist\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests and made sure
