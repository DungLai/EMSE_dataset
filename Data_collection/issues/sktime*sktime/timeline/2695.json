Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n* Refactor the `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseSplitter._split_vectorized` method to improve readability.\r\n* Simplify other small fragments of code in the same module.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nAre there any concerns regarding the new implementation of the `_split_vectorized` method? @fkiraly would be great to hear your thoughts on this, since you wrote the original code.\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Did you add any tests for the change?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is useful if you have added a test in addition to the existing ones. This will ensure that further changes to these files won't introduce the same kind of bug. It is considered good practice to add tests with newly added code to enforce the fact that the code actually works. This will reduce the chance of introducing logical bugs.\r\n-->\r\nNo, I just checked that previous tests still pass.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
