PR introduces a class `TestScenario` which models a script to run methods sequentially with certain arguments and retrieve the outcome, plus a check whether the script is applicable to an object (e.g., estimator).\r\n\r\nThis addresses a deficiency in the current testing framework, in that unit tests can retrieve only a single argument combination per estimator scitype, via the `_make_fit_args` etc family of functions.\r\n\r\nThis limitation prevents addressing a few existing and future testing requirements:\r\n\r\n* testing two subsequent `fit` calls with different arguments, #1613. The current tests are incapable of passing two different sets of arguments to the same method.\r\n* testing forecasters both with only `y` argument and with `y` and `X` argument #1674. The current tests did not detect side effects on `X` since only `y` were passed, and it is not possible to use two different sets of arguments.\r\n* the transformer refactor which allows all transformers to accept both `Series` and `Panel` inputs, requiring us to test both types of inputs #1740. This would be very hard in the current framework.\r\n* same for extending forecasters to global/hierarchical #1683 (or #1684), which will also see forecasters accepting multiple input scitypes, `Series` and `Panel` and `Hierarchical`.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the class would be used to replace existing testing functionality, and write new tests easily.\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains tests for the `TestScenario` functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7543956854,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5AL7SazwAAAAHBp6V2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7543956854","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-07T14:05:35Z","project_card":{"id":74567567,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/74567567","project_id":13845580,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/13845580","column_name":"Done","previous_column_name":"In Progress"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7545198994,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5AL7SazwAAAAHBupmS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7545198994","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-07T17:01:40Z","project_card":{"id":74567567,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/74567567","project_id":13845580,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/13845580","column_name":"Under review","previous_column_name":"Done"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
