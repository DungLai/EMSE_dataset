Ultimately I think it could help make it easier for us to facilitate the \"load pre-trained parameters\" functionality, and for people to share models and results with each other as well! Could also be a helpful practice to put into place now since it seems like `sktime` will soon have more deep learning components and something like parameter saving and sharing seems like it would be extra useful in that context.
