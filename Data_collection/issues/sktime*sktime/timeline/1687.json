#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n#1687 \r\n\r\n> #### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\n@fkiraly \r\nAs part of the probabilistic forecasting API, this will implement the `_predict_var` method to forecasters\r\n\r\n> #### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nSTEP [probabilistic forecasting API](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/13_proba_forecasting/step.md)\r\n\r\n> #### PR checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] add `_predict_var` and its corresponding tag to the forecasting extension template.\r\n- [x] add `NaiveVariance` composite class which implements the 'simple strategy' for variance prediction.\r\n- [x] implement `_predict_var` and its corresponding in `NaiveVariance`.\r\n- [x] implement `_predict_quantiles` in `NaiveVariance` where quantiles are inferred from a normal distribution. \r\n- [x] implement covariance prediction (`cov=True`)\r\n\r\n> ##### For all contributions\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass

PR implements defaults for `_predict_interval` and `_predict_quantiles`, as proposed in #1877 - for discussion (not necessarily as final version). This does not yet contain defaults in terms of `_predict_proba`, since we have not settled on output format yet.\r\n\r\nIt is partly based on work in @k1m190r's PR #1842 and @kejsitake in #1579, behaviour moved to base class default implementations.\r\n\r\nBehaviour implemented:\r\n* if `_predict_interval`  is not implemented but `_predict_quantiles` is, it is called and outputs are reformatted\r\n* if `_predict_quantiles`  is not implemented but `_predict_interval` is, it is called and outputs are reformatted\r\n* the check whether sth is implemented is done by a utility added to `BaseObject`, a method `_has_implementation_of`, which is based on @k1m190r's utility that checks whether the forecaster has been refactored, which was based on @kejsitake's and some discussion between the three of us.\r\n\r\nFurther, the following forecasters were relying primarily on `_predict_quantiles` but interfacing interval prediction logic. This has been changed by tidying up the interface, implementing a leaner `_predict_interval`, and removing `_predict_quantiles`:\r\n* `_PmdArimaAdapter`\r\n* `_TbatsAdapter`\r\n* `_ProphetAdapter`\r\n\r\nAdditional, minor changes:\r\n* docstring fixes in `BaseForecaster`\r\n* multiple minor instances of clean-up in the forecasting extension template\r\n* shortened `ThetaForecaster` internals\r\n* fix for bug in `ThetaForecaster`, where intervals were computed for 1-coverage, not coverage. Same in test for `ThetaForecaster`.\r\n* fix for bug #1954 in `_ProphetAdapter`\r\n* renamed `test_predict_pred_interval` to `test_predict_interval` for consistency with `test_predict_quantiles`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1018294863","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1687#issuecomment-1018294863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1687","id":1018294863,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc48sfJP","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T08:39:30Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T08:39:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"From

to #1746, proposes interface and technical solution.\r\nSolves interface/framework for `predict_var` and `predict_proba` in #1687.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `predict_proba` and `predict_var` interface and default behaviour to `BaseForecaster`:\r\n* `predict_var` returns a `pd.DataFrame` of variance predictions\r\n* `predict_proba` returns a `tfp` `Distribution` with batch indices corresponding to `fh` indices\r\n\r\nThe default behaviour is as follows:\r\n* `predict_var` first looks if `predict_proba` is implemented, and gets variance there if it is. Otherwise, if intervals/quantiles are implemented, returns variance of a normal with same IQR as the predictions\r\n* `predict_proba` uses `predict` as location and square root of `predict_var` as scale parameter. If `predict_var` is not directly implemented, leverages its default behaviour to get this from intervals/quantiles.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a soft dependency on `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-probability`, localized to a `dl` dependency set.\r\nThis dependency set is added to dependency specifications where necessary; a function `_check_dl_dependencies` to check and raise error if the dependency is not installed is introduced.\r\n\r\nFurther, this PR turns on a number of tests to work for `predict_var` and `predict_proba`, by adding defaults for these methods to the scenarios.\r\n\r\nDepends on the following PR:\r\n* https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2105\r\n*
