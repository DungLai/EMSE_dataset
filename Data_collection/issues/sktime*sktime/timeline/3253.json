constant values however if I am not mistaken, so pandas kurtosis and skewness function return NAs, which in turn are not handled by linear regression - leading to the error. \r\n\r\nSo either pass your own function definition for skewness and kurtosis that can handle those values, or choose a different forecasting model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1248456289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danbartl","id":19947407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQ3NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19947407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl","html_url":"https://github.com/danbartl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1248483040","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3253#issuecomment-1248483040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3253","id":1248483040,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Kalbg","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-15T18:55:55Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T18:55:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@danbartl
