a little closer, and I don't think this usage can be made valid, or even if it should. \r\n\r\nIts easier to see whats happening if you set n_jobs above to 4. This then creates a MiniRocket with n_jobs = 4, and a CalibratedClassifierCV with n_jobs = 4 and cross validation set to 2. CalibratedClassifierCV runs each CV train split in Parallel(n_jobs=4). \r\n\r\nThis will then clone MiniRocket for each fold, with MiniRocket also set to use n_jobs = 4. Somewhere deep in the threaded code, a check is made to see if the code running in the CV has an allowable number of n_jobs  (like all threaded code its a bit of a mare to degbug).\r\n\r\nSo, upshot is, if I set n_jobs = 4 for MiniRocket and cv=2, n_jobs = 4 for CalibratedClassifierCV in the above example, I get this\r\n\r\n\"ValueError: The number of threads must be between 1 and 2\"\r\n\r\nah ha, I think, it is assigning 2 jobs to each CV, so if I set n_jobs to 8, I should get between 1 and 4 .... Nope\r\n\"ValueError: The number of threads must be between 1 and 1\"\r\nwhich makes no sense. So I cant figure out exactly how CalibratedClassifierCV is assigning jobs between folds, but I am pretty sure the interference is created by the fact that CalibratedClassifierCV is allocating jobs to folds without it successfully changing n_jobs of components in the Pipeline. It is possible there could be an internal mechanism for dynamically changing this, but it is beyond me at the moment. Logically, Im not sure its sensible. If I manually set n_jobs for rocket to 4, and it is then cloned twice, would I expect my main thread to use 8 processes, or to change the rocket setting to 2? I'm not sure. \r\n\r\nSo my advice is to set n_jobs for either CalibratedClassifierCV  or for the components, but not both (I checked, both these usages work). I'm not sure how to capture this for a user to see, a MiniRocket does not know its in a pipeline or a CalibratedClassifierCV, nor should it. Really, this should be documented in the scikit documentation I think, \r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1285249882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1285561324","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2662#issuecomment-1285561324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2662","id":1285561324,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5MoBvs","user":{"login":"angus924","id":55837131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODM3MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55837131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924","html_url":"https://github.com/angus924","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angus924/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T13:41:19Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T13:41:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This all makes sense.
