If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nThis contribution does not add any new dependency.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nCheck if the warning is enough, or it would be appropriate to add a link to a separate new article in the documentation explaining in more detail the issue, listing the dependencies that cause the error, in case the user wants to install all the other dependencies in ``all_extras`` that do not generate any errors.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8133023305,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5aA4CYzwAAAAHkxBZJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8133023305","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-31T20:34:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8133023308,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5aA4CYzwAAAAHkxBZM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8133023308","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8144769c09b01125c9a1c5523a70a271fe62578a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/8144769c09b01125c9a1c5523a70a271fe62578a","created_at":"2022-12-31T20:34:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
