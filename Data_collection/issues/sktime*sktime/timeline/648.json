Subsequently, I would like to cross-validate the performance of the model on the test set (final 20% of the data) with a sliding window. Since my forecast horizon is 16 steps, I would like to monitor the performance on the test set for every lead time and the mean performance over all the lead times in a standard error metric (or multiple standard error metrics illustrated in the figure). Since I am comparing the performance to deep learning models that do not use the test data to refit or update their parameters I would only like to fit the ARIMA model on the training data.\r\n\r\nI have included two figures to illustrate what my intention is.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73986681/108042640-5ae35d80-7040-11eb-8d0d-45918f737414.png)\r\n![image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73986681/108042691-6cc50080-7040-11eb-966f-91c31b21b6c4.png)\r\n\r\nIf someone is currently working on this functionality I would be more than happy to help with the development. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/779700307/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thomhomsma","id":73986681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTg2Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73986681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma","html_url":"https://github.com/thomhomsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomhomsma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/779977995","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/648#issuecomment-779977995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/648","id":779977995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTk3Nzk5NQ==","user":{"login":"ViktorKaz","id":33499138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33499138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz","html_url":"https://github.com/ViktorKaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-16T17:05:21Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T17:07:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I was planning to work on this function but I was waiting to see what will be implemented in the [related discussion](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/657).
