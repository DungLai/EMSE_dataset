It looks like their [API reference](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/doc/modules/classes.rst) is not generated automatically, but manually (see [this issue](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9718)  as an example).\r\n\r\nOne package that might provide a solution is [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/). It generates a set of html files based off the docstrings in the code. It is configurable and should be able to make use of the __author__ variable in each file. I installed it and had it generate html files for the package. Here are some screenshots of what it looks like. It would take some work to configure it properly and combine the html files into a single API reference, but easier than starting from scratch.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17050655/88078472-86ee3d00-cb4a-11ea-9563-e02011458979.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17050655/88078134-13e4c680-cb4a-11ea-8c3a-e231a5426968.png) (\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17050655/88078353-5efed980-cb4a-11ea-87a9-ea1f1c90a50a.png))\r\n\r\nI looked at some other packages, but I don't know if any exactly generate the API Reference page.

notebooks\r\n\r\n## use cases:\r\n* search for suitable algorithms given a problem\r\n* search for information about a given algorithm\r\n\r\n## reference example from mlr3 library:\r\n*

questions:\r\n* integrate it with API reference: https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/api_reference.html (adding columns to that table)?\r\n\r\n## notes:\r\n* make clear that not all algorithm are reference implementations, even though we link them with the original research paper, some may be re-implemented, adapted or interfaced from other packages\r\n* encourage people to ping algorithm maintainers directly when they have questions about algorithm using the GitHub user name\r\n* Adding col for maintainer using
