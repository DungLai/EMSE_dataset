@Conet1502, thanks for providing the additional info. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that you mis-specify the frequency of your data. You specify `pd.PeriodIndex(series.index, freq=\"H\", name=\"Period\")` but the data is not regularly sampled hourly data. The data only has three observation per day at 9, 12 and 18 o'clock if I understand it correctly. \r\n\r\nWe currently don't handle this kind of irregular index. If you want to ignore the different durations between the observations, the easiest is to use a simple `pd.RangeIndex(len(series))` (replacing `pd.PeriodIndex(series.index, freq=\"H\", name=\"Period\")` in your code). You may also be to specify a custom frequency in pandas. \r\n\r\nI believe we should raise an error in this case instead of simply returning `nan`, but it's not easy to catch these cases. \r\n\r\nHope this helps! \r\n\r\nFYI Take a look at this [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to find out more about how to format comments on GitHub, that'll make it a lot easier to read for others.
