@mloning says, it would be good if you could state which estimators/methods this affects and which you are going to work on, as well as how your fix would look like (as algorithm or formula).\r\n\r\nWould you mind explaining?\r\n\r\nAn important discussion point would be what type your fix is:\r\n(a) a transformer which applies to all methods that don´t work for unequally spaced or length series? \r\n(b) a custom modificiation of a specific method, e.g., time series forest?\r\n(c) a bugfix that is specific to one method?\r\n\r\nBecause in case (b) you would become the \"owner\" of the modified method - it might be improved, but it is a \"new\" one (since it might not be the one described in the original paper and is based on your additional idea). In (c) the original maintainer remains the owner, since it is just an error fix. In (a) you would write a transformer.\r\n\r\n(@mloning , this is how it would be according to the maintenance document, right?)\r\n\r\nOn this it also depends where your code would

I looked at ShapeletTransformClassifier, which lead me into the ShapeletTransform class. Where I found that a few changes can make it work with unequal sizes. \r\nChanges at ShapeletTransform are:\r\n1) another way of feeding ShapeletTransform.zscore. Used \"np.array([dim[cand_start_pos: cand_start_pos + cand_len] for dim in X[series_id]])\" instead of \"X[series_id][:,cand_start_pos: cand_start_pos + cand_len]\". An the same trick with other ShapeletTransform.zscore calls.\r\nThis fixes slicing time series, if they are of different sizes, X has [samples_n, features_n] shape, where X[0, 0] will be time series with other than X[1, 0] or X[0, 1] sizes. Our matrix is no longer fully rectanglar.\r\n2) tried another condition in the comparison cycle with respect for shorter series.\r\n\r\nIf I understood @fkiraly  right, this is for (a).\r\n\r\nNow I've noticed that there is a restriction on equality of series sizes among series in a sample, but I haven't run into this because my series are 1-dimensional.\r\n\r\nBut also, I'm interested in adapting
