Is this not what you would get when you run `predict` at the values that have already been seen? Simply pass a fixed forecasting horizon with the indices that you've observed.\r\n\r\n`forecaster.fit(y).predict(fh=y.index)` or `forecaster.fit(y, fh=y.index).predict()`. Does this work for you?\r\n\r\nWhat I'm wondering, should there perhaps be a `fit_predict(y)`, which, if `fh` is not passed, defaults to in-sample forecasts, i.e., `fh=y.index`? There currently isn't, but it might be the \"in-sample\" convenience method.\r\n\r\nFeedback on whether it is what you need, or whether it's \"obvious\" would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/873558765/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4974955796,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ5NzQ5NTU3OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4974955796","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-04T10:07:24Z","label":{"name":"API

residuals:\r\nfrom a [discussion on Slack](https://sktime-group.slack.com/archives/CQVH0NJ1M/p1628935128001400) with @ngupta23 : As some models e.g. from `statsmodels` have residuals internally calculated, the best would be to have a default function `def _get_residuals(self)` or sth in the parent which is called then in `fit()` after` _fit()` was called that calculates residuals based on in-sample predictions. So we could overwrite this function in the child class for some models that provide this internally. So the parent class would get an additional attribute `residuals_`.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI was wondering why can't we get past predictions (by that I mean predictions made by the model on the train set) in sktime, actually one of the most fundamental ways to compare models is to compare their performance on train set relatively to test set performance and see if they're over-fitting: if the model performance on train set is way better than it is one the test/validation set. But in sktime we can only (I guess) see future predictions because of the fh argument that starts at 1 (as the first prediction after train set) which means we can only compare y_pred to y_test.\r\n\r\n> **Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI think this needs a refactoring of how forecasters treat the `ForecastHorizon`. either forecasters should be able to accept negative values in their `fh` argument (kinda off) or maybe (as in statsmodels) the new forecasts should start at `len(y_train)`.\r\n\r\n> **Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis makes a big difference for models that can be overfitted aka models with lots of hyper-parameters such as prophet where adding more and more seasonalities with high order can make your future predictions worse but your past predictions better. Actually all models that allow multiple seasonalities (BATS and TBAT) can over-fit easily but with this you'll be able to see it with your eyes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/913121620","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1105#issuecomment-913121620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1105","id":913121620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc42bSFU","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-05T10:00:08Z","updated_at":"2021-09-05T10:00:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n> \r\n> I think you can just run:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> transformer = Detrender(MyForecaster())\r\n> residuals = transformer.fit_transform(y)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nHi @mloning , Would it be possible to store the residual information in the forecaster object when fit is called for it? This would be more efficient since usually, the residuals are called only after fitting the forecaster (for fit assessment). Having to call another fit after that in `transformer.fit_transform` would be doubling the fit effort in terms of time. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nforecaster = ExponentialSmoothing(sp=12, seasonal=\"mul\", trend=\"add\")\r\nforecaster.fit(y)  ## store residuals in the forecaster object when fit is called.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do not want to enforce this (due to storage overhead), then maybe adding an argument to fit called `save_residuals: bool=False` would be nice to have.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nforecaster = ExponentialSmoothing(sp=12, seasonal=\"mul\", trend=\"add\")\r\nforecaster.fit(y)                       ## Does not store residuals in the forecaster object when fit is called.\r\nforecaster.fit(y, save_residuals=True)  ## Stores residuals in the forecaster object when fit is called.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/913121620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5257315633,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc430J16zwAAAAE5XEUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5257315633","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-05T10:00:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5257315634,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc430J16zwAAAAE5XEUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5257315634","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-05T10:00:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/913126333","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1105#issuecomment-913126333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1105","id":913126333,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc42bTO9","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-05T10:30:51Z","updated_at":"2021-09-05T10:32:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@ngupta23,

`predict`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/913126333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5257344241,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc430J16zwAAAAE5XLTx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5257344241","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-05T10:30:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5257344242,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc430J16zwAAAAE5XLTy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5257344242","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-05T10:30:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/913126820","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1105#issuecomment-913126820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1105","id":913126820,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc42bTWk","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-05T10:33:52Z","updated_at":"2021-09-05T10:33:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fkiraly,
