everyone, \r\n\r\nYour package looks really good and we're thinking about interfacing your package in sktime to make use of the time series distance functions you provide, and potentially also the clustering algorithms (see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/501). \r\n\r\n* Is there anything we should keep in mind when adding `dtaidistance` as a dependency? \r\n* Have you played around with integrating it with `sklearn` (I see that you largely follow their interface)? \r\n* In clustering, what is your expected input type for the time series data in `fit` and `predict`,

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. \r\n-->\r\nBegun implementing basic sktime clustering algorithms. See issue #501.\r\nAdditionally contains some utils updates to allow for importing of csv to ts dataframes automatically.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThis creates a base for future clustering algorithms. NOTE: this is the very very basic idea for clustering algorithms. All of the design decisions are up for discussion. For example the base Cluster class takes a parameter called matric which is meant to be the custom time series distance measure, however, some clustering algorithms will never be able to use this so this is up for debate as how to best present the user with the option to use custom functionality while keeping consistency.\r\n\r\nThe utils functions allow you to take a csv and convert it to a .ts file.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nThe reviewer should focus on the design. In terms of functionality not much is here it is just the sklearn algorithms with a basic wrapper. What I want to focus on is the design as some of the sklearn parameters as well as clustering algorithms (as they are completly different types of algorithms) make it awkward to make a generic solution to it. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\nI've been investigating how to make a start on making it so the clustering algorithms can use the sktime custom distance measures - the main issue i've come up against is some of the sklearn implementation do not allow for custom distance measure (annoyingly). For example the kmean implementation in sklearn. Sklearn (for some reason) has taken the line that kmeans can't be solved without euclidean (or some other algorithm) and havent allowed for a custom distance measure to be passed as such. Taking a look at how ts learn overcame this they basically just recoded the whole thing which i'd ideally not want to do but it looks like I may have to. Some of the sklearn implementation do allow for custom distance measure so may start with them but if anyone has any idea of a simpler solution for the ones that dont before I recode it would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

At the time of writing all the clustering code is on the 'clustering' branch and will hopefully be merged in this weekend to main. In this clustering branch the base classes, K-means and K-medoids (soon to be followed by K-shapes just finishing the docstring for it) have been implemented. Ill quickly just explain the state of this branch and what is left to do for these, and explain whats on my immediate todo.\r\n\r\nSo the current clustering branch, as mentioned includes: K-means and K-medoids (and shortly will also have K-shapes). These algorithms effectivly work the same except for how they either calculate centers or the distance they use. As we need to be able to change the distance and how the next centers are calculated I have essentailly written from scratch the 'k-means' clustering algorithms and made it generic in the file sktime/clustering/partitioning/_time_series_k_partition.py. I could not use the sklearn implementation of k-means as sklearn does not let you change the distance nor the centering averaging method which is critical when using different distance measures. I have allowed in my implementation ( _time_series_k_parition.py) for complete control over using different distances (passed as metric in parameters), how the centers are first initialised (passes as init_algorithm iin parameters) and finally how the new centers are caculated each iteration by defining the abstract method calculate_new_centers which it is then for the specific algorithm how it is done. \r\n\r\nIll now define what is supported for paritioning clustering algorithms in terms of distances, center initilisation and updating centers:\r\n\r\n**Distances** (though ive only tested euclidean and dtw):\r\n- euclidean\r\n- dtw\r\n- ddtw\r\n- wdtw\r\n- wddtw \r\n- lcss\r\n- erp \r\n- msm\r\n- twe \r\n(half of these I have no idea what they are but saw them in elastic and assume they were distances and could be used).\r\n\r\n**Center initialisation**:\r\n- random initailisation. \r\nI am currently working on kmeans++ initialisation algorithm hoping to get that in with the k-shapes patch\r\n\r\n**New center calculation**:\r\n- K-means\r\n       - Mean (this literally is the mean average)\r\n       - DTW Barycenter averaging (or DBA) \r\n- K-medoids\r\n       - Medoid   \r\n\r\nSo overall a good start. So im going going to put below a summary of what I'm currently working on and my immediate todo list for this coming week and anyone else who wants to hop in and do some stuff is welcome:\r\n\r\nIm currently working on:\r\n- K-shapes algorithm\r\n\r\n**TODO list (feel free to choose something you'd like to do)**\r\n- K-means++ initialisation algorithm\r\n- Massive optimisation of the DBA algorithm\r\n     -  To do this I think im going to need to reimplement the DTW in numba as we need the cost matrix's associated with DTW \r\n        so cant use the existing sktime DTW.\r\n- Example notebooks. Notebooks explaining how these algorithms work and how to use them\r\n- Unit tests - my unit tests are sorry excuses. We need to establish HOW we're going to unit test the clustering algorithms (im going to have a look at how sklearn and tslearn have tested theres).\r\n- Sklearn has another parameters ive skipped called 'n_init' which is the number of times the algorithm is run with different centroid seeds and the final results is the best output of n_init. This is probably a good idea to implement\r\n- Sklearn also appears to have some inteligent checks where you can pass a parameter called 'tol' which is the relative tolerance with regards to Forbenius norm of the difference in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare convergenece. So being able to smartly detect convergence could be a great optimisation.\r\n- Parallelism would be nice to have\r\n- Clustering evaluation - pretty sure we can just use the sklearn stuff but making sure it works and potentailly adding our own api to it and creating plots for time series specific data could be a nice addition\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/855016221/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisholder","id":4674372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4674372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisholder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/855022500","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/501#issuecomment-855022500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/501","id":855022500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTAyMjUwMA==","user":{"login":"chrisholder","id":4674372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4674372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisholder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-04T21:56:14Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T21:59:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Just going to follow this comment up with how im going about deciding what to implement and where im referencing most of my stuff. At the moment im basically just implementing the state of the art for partitioning as it is the most immediate algorithms I need for my Masters. What I am hoping to achieve over the rest of summer is to get to the same point in terms of algorithm coverage as the 'leading' time series clustering package which is probably an R library called dtwclust. I am also of course looking at the Sklearn clustering algorithm and hope to get all of these implemented.\r\n\r\nMore information on dtwclust can be found here: https://github.com/asardaes/dtwclust. Specifically im looking at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtwclust/vignettes/dtwclust.pdf for finer details on specific implementations however, im also hoping we can implement further algorithms such as DNNs clustering (cant cite the paper Im referring to for this as it is still under review) and shapelet based approaches (see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6413851) for example. Overall I hope we can create the most complete set of time series clustering algorithms across paritioning, density and hierarchical approches and am really looking forward to collaborating with others to make this happen!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/855022500/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisholder","id":4674372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4674372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisholder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/856886226","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/501#issuecomment-856886226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/501","id":856886226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1Njg4NjIyNg==","user":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-08T15:47:37Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T15:47:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks Chris, I'll list some points here\r\n1.
