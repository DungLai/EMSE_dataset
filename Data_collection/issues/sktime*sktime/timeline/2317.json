by @fkiraly: the root cause of the below is, probably, forecasting pipelines not performing transform in the `update` method. Changed the title to reflect this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n-->\r\n`update_predict_single` no longer refits the model in v0.10.1\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nforecast_horizon=24\r\ncov=0.95\r\npreds, conf_ints = model.update_predict_single(\r\n    y=y_new, X=None, \r\n    fh=np.arange(1, forecast_horizon+1),\r\n    update_params=True,\r\n    return_pred_int=True, alpha=1-cov\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nThe model should be refitted when setting `update_params` to True. It seems like the property class `_y` attribute gets updated with the new observations, but the model is not refitted, and predictions returned are just longer forecasts of the originally trained model.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.11 (default, Jan 25 2022, 23:19:55)  [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)]\r\nexecutable: /Users/tsangis/Projects/uk-ds-day-ahead-prices-forecast/venv/bin/python\r\n   machine: macOS-12.0.1-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.0.3\r\n   setuptools: 58.0.4\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.2\r\n       sktime: 0.10.1\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.1\r\n        numpy: 1.21.1\r\n        scipy: 1.7.3\r\n       pandas: 1.4.1\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.1\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.1\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.4\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1087324986","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2317#issuecomment-1087324986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2317","id":1087324986,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Az0M6","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-04T09:28:26Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T09:28:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fkiraly Since #2318 is implemented, can we close this or do you think anything else is pending on this issue?
