@aiwalter and @koralturkk - this sounds like an interesting idea! I'm a little hesitant on adding TensorFlow Probability as a soft dependency because we had several issues with integrating it into the CI/CD workflows in other projects (sktime-dl especially). A may be a better idea to work on this in a companion repository. \r\n\r\nIf this is something you're interested in, I'm happy to create one under the sktime organisation and give you admin rights. Since this would be a pure Python package, setting up CI/CD pipelines to check compatibility with the main repo shouldn't be too difficult either. \r\n\r\nRegarding the design: Could you show me what you have in mind for the user journey?

thx for feedback. Regarding design, `BSTS` works with components, so the user is free to add several of them to a model. In the following example, there are two components, `sts.LocalLinearTrend` and `sts.Seasonal`:\r\n```python\r\ndef build_model(observed_time_series):\r\n  trend = sts.LocalLinearTrend(observed_time_series=observed_time_series)\r\n  seasonal = sts.Seasonal(\r\n      num_seasons=12, observed_time_series=observed_time_series)\r\n  model = sts.Sum([trend, seasonal], observed_time_series=observed_time_series)\r\n  return model\r\n```\r\nSo in `sts.Sum` the components are build together to one model. How to provide the user this flexibility comes back to the question above where I wrote down the 2 options I had in mind of how to deal with component. Basically this components will be given to `sktime.BSTS()` as arguments. The function `build_model` from the exmaple could be a part of the `_instantiate_model()` function.\r\nRegarding adding this to `sktime`, I would propose we give it a try to get it running with CI. Now I have also @koralturkk to get it running on all

regarding design:\r\nI think aiming for *both* wrapped individual components and wrapped composites makes sense here! If I had to choose, I'd say to aim for wrapped composites, since that is more flexible and robust with regards to extensions and changes of `BSTS`.\r\n\r\nThe \"really nice thing\", design-wise, would be adding a compiler-like layer that recognizes when adjacent sktime components are from `BSTS` and replaces them by a wrapped (and more efficient) `BSTS` composite. But perhaps out of scope due to complexity...\r\n\r\nRegarding dependencies: as @mloning says, one of these days, we need to fix how we manage the neural network package dependencies. Currently, we have no maintainer dedicated to that family of dependencies - it is quite some work to keep these spinning, so help would be very much welcome.\r\nThe problem is greater than just `BSTS`, it is essentially \"anything that depends on tf\", so it would be maintaining \"time series models using deep learning packages\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/759414483/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4200953805,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIwMDk1MzgwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4200953805","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-13T12:23:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4200953811,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMDA5NTM4MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4200953811","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-13T12:23:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/759432956","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/612#issuecomment-759432956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/612","id":759432956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTQzMjk1Ng==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-13T12:59:42Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T12:59:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Ok,
