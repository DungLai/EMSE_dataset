Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nPR fixes issue number #284.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe algorithm that I have implemented here is ShapeDTW which is similar to ordinary DTW except that instead of performing DTW on the original time series, you transform it into a list of arrays or shapelets. DTW is then performed on these list of arrays. This algorithm involved implementing several new transformers - SlidingWindowSegmenter, DerivativeTransformer, DWTTransformer and more. This algorithm did require writing a helper function in TimeSeriesNeighbours so that this module is compatible with multivariate classification (the distance metrics are compatable but the original TimeSeriesNeighbours is not). \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n\r\nNot anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\n\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n \r\n- [ ] I have updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my algorithm works.\r\n   \r\n- [x] I have updated sktime's \r\n[estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm\r\n committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/287/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/653027140","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/328#issuecomment-653027140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/328","id":653027140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzAyNzE0MA==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-02T14:07:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T14:07:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for raising the issue!
