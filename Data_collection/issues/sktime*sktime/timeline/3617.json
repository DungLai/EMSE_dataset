The attempt to fit and predict was not successful, but identified a possible resolution, which is applied in Case 4.\n·        Case 4 successfully fits and predicts using the dataset and forecaster from Case 3, by converting target values to a Pandas DataFrame.\n \nIn Case 1 the unit_test data is loaded as a nested_univ Panel. The IndividualBoss estimator successfully fits and predicts on this dataset\n\n \n\nCases 2a and 2b convert the unit_test data to a pd-mulitiindex mtype, which leads to two fatal errors when attempting to split (2a) and fit (2b) the converted dataset, respectively:\n·         TypeError: as_index=False only valid with DataFrame\n·         ValueError: Mismatch in number of cases. Number in X = 42 nos in y = 1008\n \nIn Case 3, the attempt to fit a numeric dataset with the Bagging Forecaster fails with the following message:\n·         y must be in an sktime compatible format, of scitype Series, Panel or Hierarchical, for instance a pandas.DataFrame with sktime compatible time indices, or with MultiIndex and last(-1) level an sktime compatible time index. See the forecasting tutorial examples/01_forecasting.ipynb, or the data format tutorial examples/AA_datatypes_and_datasets.ipynb,If you think y is already in an sktime supported input format, run sktime.datatypes.check_raise(y, mtype) to diagnose the error, where mtype is the string of the type specification you want for y. Possible mtype specification strings are as follows. \"For Hierarchical scitype: ['pd_multiindex_hier'].\n \nThe above message identifies the failure point as (target) y. Attempting to determine y’s format produces the following message, which indicates that, for a multiindex, y must be a pandas DataFrame.\n·         No valid mtype could be identified for object of type <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>. Errors returned are as follows, in format [mtype]: [error message] \n·         df-list: obj must be list of pd.DataFrame, found <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n·         numpy3D: obj must be a numpy.ndarray, found <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n·         pd-multiindex: obj must be a pd.DataFrame, found <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n·         nested_univ: obj must be a pd.DataFrame, found <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n \nIn Case 4, the target y is converted from a Pandas Series to a DataFrame, following the discovery from Case 3. Fitting and prediction were successful, with the following result:\ninstances timepoints           \n0        3            5.999900\n         4            5.999900\n         5            5.999900\n1        3           21.667727\n         4           21.667727\n         5           21.667727\n2        3           17.666301\n         4           17.666301\n         5           17.666301\n \n \n\nConclusions/Recommendations\n\nFrom my perspective, the issues from Cases 2a and 2b call for investigation and correction. Cases 3 and 4 are not so clear to me but perhaps can be resolved with additional explanation. However, I don’t understand why formatting target values as a Pandas Series should not be acceptable in all cases, since it is a standard container for univariate data structures.\n\n \n\nMore broadly, while I support the scitype/mtype concept as providing a well-defined context SKTime time series evaluation, how much must a user understand to be able to use SKTime effectively and efficiently, as compared with competing packages that may not require it?\n\n \n\nI hope this is helpful, but please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\n \n\nThanks for your help and support.\n\n \n\nDavid L.

\n\nThank you for all your help. I have been working extensively with SKT, trying to successfully utilize exogenous variables, but with limited success. I have recently completed some testing with the SKI Longley data, which is used in some of the exogenous examples from your materials. To summarize, my results indicate that the forecasters I am using do not recognize or at least utilize the exogenous variables.\n\n \n\nThe attached self-contained script demonstrates my findings. Regardless of the exogenous variable used from none to all and in various combinations, the predictions are identical for each of four the of the forecasters I tested: Naïve, Theta, Polynomial Trend and AutoETS, as shown below. (That is, the values vary between forecasters but are identical within each. \n\n \n\nI tested four scenarios: baseline, using the framework presented in the example, y-only, individual attributes (X columns) and sequentially adding columns. \n\n \n\nI understand some forecasters do not support exogenous variables; are the ones I used in that category? However, you will not I used the Naïve forecaster from the SKT example, which I assume indicates you believe it supports them.\n\n \n\nI look forward to hearing from you.
