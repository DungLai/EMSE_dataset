I'd approach it as follows: \r\n* do a bit more online research if it already exists, google searches, perhaps open an issue on statsmodels or even better, ask in their Googlemail list\r\n* read about ETS in https://otexts.com/fpp3/expsmooth.html\r\n* get the R version to run on the airline data set (or any other data set, but we've got the airline data set in sktime too) in RStudio or so\r\n* start translating the version from fable into Python, inherit from BaseSktimeForecaster
