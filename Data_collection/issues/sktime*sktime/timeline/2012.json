the culprit might not `pytest-xdist`, but high memory usage interacting with `pytest-xdist`.\r\n\r\nA hypothesis goes like this:\r\n* historically, our test framework created a large, combinatorial number of combinations of fixtures to feed to the tests\r\n* `pytest.mark.parametrize` passes these as-is, so these are mutable. In particular, estimators that are being fitted are mutated with the contents of the fitting\r\n* it is my strong suspicion that in the tests, facebook prophet and similar \"high-memory\" estimators were hence shoveling garbage into the mutable fixtures\r\n* leading to the tests, on CI/CD, operating constantly near memory death\r\nthe recent refactor (PR 1992), where I incidentally increased combinatorial combination of fixtures, started failing out of memory\r\n* following this suspicion, I changed fixtures from lists to generators #2022 - i.e., only one fixture combination at a time lives and then dies as pytest walks through the generator\r\n* this appears to give us performances of 30min in the CI/CD, without use of `pytest-xdist`, as opposed to 60-80min currently.\r\n* so, if I didn't do anything wrong and the speed is due to a bug, it strongly indicates that the hypothesis about memory garbage caused by prophet et al is accurate?\r\n\r\nWe should profile memory, hence, to check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1033177274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T23:52:17Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T23:52:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2030","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2030/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2030/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2030/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2030","id":1127880003,"node_id":"I_kwDOCVKAsc5DOhVD","number":2030,"title":"[ENH]
