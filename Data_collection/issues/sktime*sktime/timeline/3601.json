thanks for reporting :) \r\n\r\n@HishamSalem \r\nI think the original code had a bug, why do you always call RandomForestRegressor?\r\n\r\nI modified your code slightly to make it more reproducible, and results are the same?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that tiny differences arise when specifying lag features = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12] etc. because order of features is different, get exact same result when specifying lag features .reverse()\r\n\r\n@fkiraly  can be closed, but I will add a test verifying exactly that :).\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n#### Imports\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection
