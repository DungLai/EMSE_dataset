#671 by adding requested functionality. \r\n\r\nThis is a draft pull request. I need to finish the docstrings (I'm adding examples to docstrings) and also write unit tests but wanted to give you a heads up of the functionality. \r\n\r\nThe pull request adds new forecasting performance metrics (see list below) that can each work with multivariate series (but default to work with univariate forecasts). Also changes naming conventions to align with scikit-learn (e.g. mean_absoluate_error rather than mae or mae_loss). \r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n\r\nrelative_error,\r\nmean_asymmetric_error,\r\nmean_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmean_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmean_absolute_error,\r\nmean_squared_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_squared_error,\r\nmean_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmean_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmean_relative_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNot as coded. But several of the functions could be replaced by wrappers on scikit-learn functions. However, this would require changing the scikit-learn dependency to be >=0.24 which might be unneeded. \r\n\r\nAs coded, I use their code (need to ensure I have references to the places I do that) to avoid the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nLet me know if the naming convention changes to the forecasting metrics makes sense. To me it makes sense to keep this as aligned with scikit-learn's metrics. \r\n\r\nNote that I also added a few tweaks in the validation functions to support the ability to validate the input data to these functions. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/778221193","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/671#issuecomment-778221193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/671","id":778221193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODIyMTE5Mw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-12T14:16:01Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T14:16:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks @RNKuhns - this looks great!

about some time series regression metrics which are not present in scikit-learn? So far, scikit-learn has the MAPE. This measure has some serious shortcomings, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error#Issues). If you are interested in this topic, the following could be good additions:\r\n\r\n## Mean directional accuracy\r\nI think this one is especially interesting when you only want to predict the direction of your time series correctly. Up or down nothing else. A classic problem to apply this is when dealing with the prediction of stock prices. I don't really care if my model can tell me if the stock price rises by 10% or 20%, it's important that it rises. And the model won't output accurate percentages anyway. It makes it potentially easier to design a well-performing model according to this metric.\r\n\r\n## Logarithm of the accuracy ratio\r\n[Here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2635088), the author explains why it is a good measure. What I like about this measure: Usually, the MAPE punishes over and underestimating differently. If the actual value A is 2 and the forecast F is 1, the APE here is 0.5. If A=2 and F=4, the APE is 1. Two different scores, although the prediction is half or double the actual value, and I would like these errors to be the same. The Logarithm of the accuracy ratio does exactly that (0.48 in both cases). (By the way, the Mean directional accuracy does this, too.)\r\n\r\nAnother nice property is that the best constant prediction for some label vector y is the geometric mean of y. This is analog to the mean, which is the best constant prediction for the MSE metric, or the median for the MAD metric.\r\n\r\n[You can find my implementations here.](https://github.com/Garve/scikit-bonus/blob/master/skbonus/metrics/_regression.py)\r\n\r\nIf you like, I can do a pull request.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRobert","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T09:33:40Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T09:33:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/352","id":661271103,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NjEyNzExMDM=","number":352,"title":"Feature

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #671. See discussion on closed PR #672 that this pull request will complete. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAdds additional forecasting metrics as discussed in #671. \r\n\r\nThis is a draft pull request. I need to finish the docstrings (I'm adding examples to docstrings) and also write unit tests but wanted to give you a heads up of the functionality.\r\n\r\nThe pull request adds new forecasting performance metrics (see list below) that can each work with multivariate series (but default to work with univariate forecasts). Also changes naming conventions to align with scikit-learn (e.g. mean_absoluate_error rather than mae or mae_loss).\r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n\r\nrelative_error,\r\nmean_asymmetric_error,\r\nmean_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmean_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmean_absolute_error,\r\nmean_squared_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_squared_error,\r\nmean_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmean_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmean_relative_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNone. Pinning Scikit-learn dependency to >= 0.24.* was done separately.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nFocus on changes in ./performance_metrics/forecasting/_functions.py and ./performance_metrics/forecasting/_classes.py. \r\n\r\nFinishing fixes elsewhere in module where old performance metric names (e.g. sMAPE) are imported. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
