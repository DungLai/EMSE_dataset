nice, thx for clarification @mloning !\r\nI was not aware that `last` in combination with `sp` is already doing this. Should have looked better into it probably. I think just taking the last 4 points to forecast the next 4 points will then work when I set `sp=4`, right. So even if there is basically no seasonality known or identified, I would just set `sp=4`, right?
