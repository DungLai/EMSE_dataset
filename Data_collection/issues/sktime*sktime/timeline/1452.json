I've noticed this issue, and have digged into it. I've temporarily fixed the issue in `tsai`.\r\nHere's what I found: \r\n\r\n- the issue doesn't occur with pandas 1.1. It occurs with pandas 1.3. \r\n- this code works well: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nimport sktime\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\ncols = [f\"var_{i}\" for i in range(2)]\r\nX = pd.DataFrame(columns=cols, index=[0, 1, 2])\r\nX.iloc[0][0] = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\n    So this operation is allowed by pandas.\r\n\r\n- However, in tsai  fastai was imported before sktime. fastai applies a patch to pandas that causes the issue: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom fastcore.basics import patch\r\n\r\nif not hasattr(pd.DataFrame,'_old_init'): pd.DataFrame._old_init = pd.DataFrame.__init__\r\n\r\n@patch\r\ndef __init__(self:pd.DataFrame, data=None, index=None, columns=None, dtype=None, copy=False):\r\n    if data is not None and isinstance(data, Tensor): data = to_np(data)\r\n    self._old_init(data, index=index, columns=columns, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)\r\n    \r\ncols = [f\"var_{i}\" for i in range(2)]\r\nX = pd.DataFrame(columns=cols, index=[0, 1, 2])\r\n\r\nX.iloc[0][0] = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n \r\n   this works up to pandas 1.1, but fails with 1.3. \r\n\r\nIMO, the issue is not caused by sktime. It's caused by fastai. \r\n\r\nI've temporarily changed the order of imports to avoid the issue. But a more permanent fixed is required. I have created an issue with fastai (https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/3485).
