to #52 (oldest open issue!) and #1062.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains:\r\n\r\n* base classes for a new scitype: pairwise transformers, i.e., distance matrix makers and kernel matrix makers; there are two base classes for two different inputs, tabular (classical distances/kernels) and time series panels (e.g., time warping distances)\r\n* an example tabular distance `ScipyDist` that interfaces the `scipy` distances\r\n* an example panel distance `AggrDist` that uses any tabular distance to create an aggregate sample distance between time series, e.g., the mean Euclidean distance\r\n* extension templates for both scitypes\r\n* tests for the concrete scitypes added\r\n\r\nThis may be useful for future extension of the clustering module, or refactorings and extensions of the TSC module, @chrisholder, @TonyBagnall.\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @jasonlines since this is a proposal how the existing distances (due to @jasonlines) could be
