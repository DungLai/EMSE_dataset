@fkiraly I edited the output to what I think you mean, thanks\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: I would like to have a block of code that I can copy-paste, it runs without any additional imports, and that breaks - so we can debug.\r\n\r\nThe top code block (which I briefly reformatted) has missing imports (e.g., `pd` is not imported), and it seems to run without bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1272122111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7546835389,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5TeOqczwAAAAHB05G9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7546835389","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-07T22:08:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7546835393,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5TeOqczwAAAAHB05HB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7546835393","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-07T22:08:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1272124860","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3536#issuecomment-1272124860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3536","id":1272124860,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5L0xW8","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T22:12:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T22:12:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"These

Convert to 3d np arr:\r\n\r\n        tmp = df.unstack().stack(level=1)\r\n\r\n       arr = np.array(\r\n            [tmp.xs(i).to_numpy() for i in df.index.unique(\"n_cases\")]\r\n        )\r\n\r\nWhich I believe gives a different  shape than what happens when sktime converts the multi-index that I belive is giving me the shape numpy 3D shape [n_cases][series_length][n_dimensions].\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1278783701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanbyrne226","id":50303858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzAzODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50303858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226","html_url":"https://github.com/seanbyrne226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbyrne226/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1278835928","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3536#issuecomment-1278835928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3536","id":1278835928,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5MOXzY","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T10:43:46Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T10:43:46Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"could
