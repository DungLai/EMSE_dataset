have already started implementing a transformer, but now I faced issues with the transformer interface. So the issue is, that the regressor would need `y` and `X` so also the transformer needs both then. But there is no such case in the transformer interface where `y` and `X` is given and `Xt` is returned. See STEP [here ](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/01_forecasting_api/forecasting_pipeline.md) where we wrote down the cases.\r\n\r\nWe can solve this by switching the order of arguments, so the transformer would get the data as follows:\r\n```python\r\nXt = SelectExogeneous(...).fit_transform(Z=X, X=y)\r\n```\r\nThis switch is needed as we transform `X` by selecting some columns (features) and return `Xt.` `y` is just needed to train the regressor. This switch looks a bit weird maybe and also then we need a new tag for this, so in `ForecastingPipeline` we can have an if statement to check if `y` and `X` have to be switched. As currently the `ForecastingPipeline` just does `Transformer().fit_transform(Z=X)` and is not giving `y`. We already use the `skip-inverse-transform` tag, so it might be ok to add another into the `ForecastingPipeline`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/901175097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/902005361","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1268#issuecomment-902005361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1268","id":902005361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc41w4Jx","user":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-19T15:21:06Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T15:21:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I discussed this with @mloning and he proposed to always switch arguments in `ForecastingPipeline` to have `fit(Z=X, X=y)` as we also give both arguments in `TransformedTargetForecaster.fit(Z=y, X=X)`.
