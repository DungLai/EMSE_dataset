After some digging it looks like the issue has been addressed by the author of that library [here](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima/issues/256), where he mentions that `pmdarima` relies on `statsmodels` and that \"statsmodels creates a lot of private instance attributes when you call fit, and we would have to do an unbelievable level of surgery on private variables to simple add to the endog/exog array.\"\r\n\r\nBecause this class of model is usually pretty fast to retrain, the general consensus seems to be it's not worth the complexity. However I would think for more complex/expensive to train models this would be a worthwhile feature to add, if indeed it is missing. I have verified that the `update()` method does work (check `mod._y` to confirm after an update) so presumably a model that does not rely on `statsmodels` would easily accept this before executing `predict()`. \r\n\r\nIt seems like it'd be helpful to either remove the option altogether, or at least add a warning to models of this type so that users understand they can't actually pass `update_params = False` with the expected behavior, but I'll wait for a core contributor to weigh in on that before I actually create a ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1263896520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chillerobscuro","id":5232872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5232872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro","html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1264336832","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3496#issuecomment-1264336832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3496","id":1264336832,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5LXD_A","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-01T11:34:42Z","updated_at":"2022-10-01T11:34:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Is this the same as https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1788, or different?
