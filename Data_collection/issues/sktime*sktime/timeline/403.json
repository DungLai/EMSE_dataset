Currently there are some duplication of code that could be factored out depending on how we like to structure the code, I can continue the work on this but would like to get some early feedback. \r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/721345358","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/403#issuecomment-721345358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/403","id":721345358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTM0NTM1OA==","user":{"login":"NikeNano","id":22057410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDU3NDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22057410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano","html_url":"https://github.com/NikeNano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikeNano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-03T20:00:06Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T20:00:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I will not have time to work on this in the near future, so if any one like to pick it up feel free to do so.

See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nSee #403 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nCreated MultioutputRegressionForecaster class via a _MultioutputReducer base class.

If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments.

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
