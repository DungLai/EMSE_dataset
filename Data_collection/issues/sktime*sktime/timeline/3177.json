and overlapping folds as `cv` to `update_predict`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `sktime` interprets `numpy` passed to `update` as non-overlapping.\r\n\r\n`update_predict`, at current `main`, simply cuts and passed to `update`, which would result in `sktime` interpreting the folds as non-overlapping, leading to inflated training time span.\r\n\r\nHow should we deal with that, logically?\r\nMy intuition is conversion to `pandas` with overlapping integer index, but - unlike in the other methods where a simple conversion is sufficient - this seems to incur substantial amoutns of extra logic which is specific to `numpy`, which I do not like.\r\n\r\nAny ideas,
