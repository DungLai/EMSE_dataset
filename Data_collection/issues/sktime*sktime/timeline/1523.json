the bug**\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n--> I have a weekly dataset with W-WED frequency that I want to train an AutoETS model on.

have found why the bug occurs. Within `to_absolute` the internal function `_get_freq` is used to obtain the frequency which is then given to the conversion. The `_get_freq` function is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _get_freq(x):\r\n    \"\"\"Get unit for conversion of time deltas to integer.\"\"\"\r\n    if hasattr(x, \"freqstr\"):\r\n        if x.freqstr is None:\r\n            return None\r\n        elif \"-\" in x.freqstr:\r\n           return x.freqstr.split(\"-\")[0]\r\n        else:\r\n            return x.freqstr\r\n    else:\r\n        return None\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in the case of this bug we have `freqstr = \"W-WED\"` but the `_get_freq` function only returns \"W\" which then defaults back to \"W-SUN\" hence the error. This could be easily fixed by removing the case distinction for \"-\" in the `freqstr` however I imagine it is there for a reason, @fkiraly @mloning do you know why this case distinction is needed?

Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #1523 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nRemoves use of `_get_freq` in the `fh.to_absolute()` conversion. `_get_freq` removes anchorings, this was causing issues when users needed to convert a frequency involving an anchoring as the information was lost and the horizon defaults back to \"W-SUN\" even if another day e.g. \"W-WED\" was specified.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nno\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nWhether this change impacts other parts of the code. Presumably this functionality of removing anchorings is there for a reason, it just seems unnecessary for the `to_absolute` functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5889228968,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc49PDgYzwAAAAFfBoCo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5889228968","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-13T17:30:25Z","project_card":{"id":74147086,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/74147086","project_id":5198515,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/5198515","column_name":"Under review","previous_column_name":"Investigating"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
