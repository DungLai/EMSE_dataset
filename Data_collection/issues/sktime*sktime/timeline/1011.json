are about to start to implement our Kalman filter, we have done quite a bit of research about the filter and have a few questions about the usage and implementation. \r\nThere are several matrices needed to make the calculations for the Kalman filter: \r\nQ - process noise matrix \r\nR - measurement noise matrix \r\nA/F - state transition matrix \r\nB/G - control matrix\r\nShould these matrices be user inputs for the constructor? \r\n\r\nWe also found that for efficient smoothing effect it is important to have a strong initial guess of X - estimated system state and P - covariance matrix (X0, P0).  \r\nIs there a way to create them in an efficient way for the use of the filter? We found one way but it seems to be inefficient and long. Should we leave the option for user input for X and P as well?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1108714046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lielleravid","id":37774194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc0MTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37774194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid","html_url":"https://github.com/lielleravid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1108721861","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1011#issuecomment-1108721861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1011","id":1108721861,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5CFcDF","user":{"login":"lielleravid","id":37774194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc0MTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37774194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid","html_url":"https://github.com/lielleravid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lielleravid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-25T15:26:46Z","updated_at":"2022-04-25T15:26:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, how would you like us to take care of the case where there is missing measurements in the data?

Segmentation) are “semantic segmentation” algorithms that divide a time series into internally consistent homogenous regions called regimes.\r\n[FLUSS issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2868), [FLOSS issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2820).\r\n\r\n\r\n**What are your learning goals?**\r\n- Learning about collaborative coding practices\r\n- Deepen my knowledge in machine learning algorithms for time series\r\n- Improve my coding skills by using aspects of software engineering.\r\n\r\n**What's next for you after the mentorship program?**\r\n<!-- Thanks for participating!
