But note that will raise a `NotImplementedError` because it isn't implemented yet. Updating parameters is usually model specific. I'm not sure if there is a common way to update exponential smoothing models. For state-space models, Kalman filtering could be used, but I'm not sure if the underlying algorithms from statsmodels allows us to do this easily. \r\n * For fixed-cutoff multi-step predictions, the ExponentialSmoothing algorithms makes forecasts recursively using previously predicted values. For moving-cutoff predictions, it should instead use the new observed values. But again, not sure if we can easily implement this for the underlying statsmodel algorithm. The problem is that we do not update the `self._fitted_forecaster` in `update()` as `update()` is defined in the parent class [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/27effd92879968f25447d449341863e0d86dfca7/sktime/forecasting/base/_sktime.py#L282). I think we should raise a not implemented error here for now or fix it if possible.\r\n* In addition, perhaps we should set the default of `update_params` to true, as this is what people may expect?\r\n* We should update the documentation and example notebook too to explain this better. The `NaiveForecaster` may also be a somewhat confusing case, because it does update predictions without updating any parameters. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you want to look into this, help would be very welcome!

@mloning thanks for promptly replying the issue.\r\n\r\n> If you want to incrementally update the fitted parameters as new data comes in, you have use update_predict() with update_params=True as

I'm not sure if there is a common way to update exponential smoothing models. For state-space models, Kalman filtering could be used, but I'm not sure if the underlying algorithms from statsmodels allows us to do this easily.\r\n\r\nYeah, ExponentialSmoothing doesn't support incremental retraining with partial data. In such case is it good idea if `update_predict` should fallback to refit/retrain a completely new model in each step? Same goes for other model which doesn't support incremental retrain. So the promise of `update_predict()` is  to return updated forecast as new data come and  incremental retrain can be seen as a form of internal implementation / optimization of each model. \r\n\r\n> In addition, perhaps we should set the default of update_params to true, as this is what people may expect?\r\n\r\nYes, my expectation is the `update_params` in `update_predict()` is True by default, since the prediction without changing the model's param is already covered by `predict()` to some degree. \r\n\r\nI can take a stab if you agree with above approach.

I already wanted to reply to this.\r\n\r\nRegarding interface, @mloning :\r\nI actually think that `update` should fall back to either \"ignore the data\", or \"refit on all the data\" (if available) - simply since it is a standard interface point that should be implemented by a templated class - composites may expect it, e.g., the hedge algorithm or other ensembles.\r\n\r\nSimilarly how you wouldn't return a `NotImplementedError` in `sklearn` `fit_predict` as long as you have a `fit` and `predict`.\r\nPerhaps it can return a warning \"update is not implemented, falling back to ...\" though.\r\n\r\nRegarding update for Holt-Winters specifically:\r\nIsn´t Holt-Winters following as simple linear recurrence relation?\r\nSo, shouldn´t updating in-principle be somewhat straightforward if tedious to work out, at least not requiring to remember all the training data?\r\n\r\nThat's for the math/theory side - when it comes to off-shelf update functionality implemented, these do not seem to exist (in R or python).

the bug**\r\nWhen performing `update_predict()` on `ReducedRegressionForecaster`, the parameter values are not updated using the latest data. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nI will add some code later if needed, but here is the code stack:\r\n\r\n[`update_predict`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/v0.5.2/sktime/forecasting/base/_sktime.py#L580)  --> [`_predict_moving_cutoff`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/v0.5.2/sktime/forecasting/base/_sktime.py#L610)  --> [`_update_predict_single`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/36f3cb1b96421bb08e041d16949d3d8a9be6f7d8/sktime/forecasting/base/_sktime.py#L456) --> This does a `self.update()`, but it simply updates the data values using `_update_y_X()` and does not refit the model with this data to update the parameters.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter each update of the data, one would expect that the model parameters also be updated using the latest data. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSimilar issue can be found in
