our approach to this is agile: we are going for stripped down sklearn versions in numpy first to test correctness and to serve as a benchmark on timing for the pipeline versions. We aim to run all on the default train/test splits, ideally before the march meeting. tl;dr we will have a set of results to generate any required graphs for the poster, completeness of them is uncertain. There are five hive-cote components\r\n1. TSF: we have two alternative implementations, mine and Marcus's. Both are not significantly different in accuracy from the java version (and each other) on a decent subset of the data, but the pipeline one is significantly slower than the numpy one. The reason needs determining, and I need to compare latest timings from the Marcus version tomorrow. \r\n2. RISE:  numpy based implemented  and running, will have correctness and timing by tuesday. Simple port to pipeline version. \r\n3. BOSS: we have a first implementation, not optimised for speed, we need to work on it a bit. Running, will have about 70% complete by tuesday\r\n4. EE: Jasons base version is running (he can confirm) but pig slow. cython implementation in the works\r\n5. ST:  Jasons base version is running (he can confirm), David is working on refinements.   \r\n\r\nonce the bakeoff recreation is complete, we need to decide on priorities. Issues include\r\n1. Resolve slowness of pipeline version and adapt implementations into this format if appropriate\r\n2. Handle missing values for each module, either with a bespoke algorithm adjustments internally to the classifier or through standard transforms as a contained object\r\n3. Handle unequal length series, as above\r\n4. Implement naive multivariate version (dimensions independent)\r\nwe can then complete the bakeoff on all the new univariate data and the multivariate also. I would hope to get all this done for HIVE-COTE by end of the project. If renewed, we can obviously move it all forward further. There are several recently published algorithms we can port in with the help of the authors, one I'm currently reviewing for KDD!
