@TonyBagnall ! Thank you for the answer ! \r\n*I will check later your solution.*\r\nWhat I have done until that moment is using `ColumnEnsembleClassifier`:\r\n```python\r\nstc = ShapeletTransformClassifier(\r\n                estimator=RotationForest(n_estimators=50),\r\n                n_shapelet_samples=100,\r\n                max_shapelets=75,\r\n                batch_size=20,\r\n                n_jobs=-1)\r\n            estimators = [(\"STC \" + str(signal_num), stc, [signal_num])]\r\n            classifier = ColumnEnsembleClassifier(estimators=estimators)\r\n```\r\nThis is not the best way, and I think I have to learn a little bit about array types (but in my case it is not too bad to import all the signals, as I was doing some experimental research on that).
