TSF refers to one specific published algorithm. Clearly it can be configured and parameterised, but the key defining characteristic is that it uses summary measures of time dependent intervals. The class TSF is not a suitable vehicle for, say, assembling a shapelet or spectral transform with a classifier. It can be modelled internally as a pipeline if you want, but it is a specific instance of a class of algorithm. \r\n\r\nI did mean base classifier. Essentially, 4 of the 5 components of COTE can be considered a composition of transforms and ensembles classifiers (it is collective of transform-based ensembles).  You could generalise that to a fully user configurable classifier, its a nice idea, but I do not want to offer the facility for the user to, e.g. force something called BOSS to actually be TSF  \r\n\r\nI'm not keen on multiple implementations of the same algorithm. We should collectively decide the best way to go and use that.

have benchmarked my stripped down TSF variant that is a port from Java. tl;dr: they are the same. But I have had a little journey I wish to recount, its a small story of implicit experimenter bias. I expected the python version to be slower. My first test confirmed this, it was 4x slower than Java, even though I have stripped it down in python. However, there are still some small variants between the implementations because the base classifiers are different. There was also a very small, but significant (when tested over many data) difference in accuracy between the classifiers: python was significantly more accurate! It comes down to the tree. I'll explain to anyone who cares, but they have different default settings. When I made then equivalent on one parameter (there are still differences), the accuracy and timing differences disappeared.
