As we are working on pandas dataframes, the inbuilt apply() function can be used; however, it performs very similarly to that of a simple for loop.\r\n\r\nParallelism options that I could think of are\r\n1. joblib: we should manually split dataframes into pieces and process them in parallel and then combine. This performs reasonably well, but I don't think joblib can scale well to clusters in future. Also, we should manually split and combine dataframes.\r\n2. dask: This automatically splits the dataframes, can work in clusters, can use big data sets from disks or networks even with very little RAM; but, this is not a drop in replacement for pandas (but very similar). It builds compute graphs and then executes it efficiently like tensorflow. This is currently promoted as a python friendly alternative for spark.\r\n\r\nRelevant performance comparison is available at
