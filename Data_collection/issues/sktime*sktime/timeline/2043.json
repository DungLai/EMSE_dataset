Explain your changes.\r\nThe issue in `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe` happend because `has_class_labels_tag = False`. This is because the line \r\n\r\n```python\r\nelif line.startswith(\"@classlabel\"):\r\n     ....\r\n     has_class_labels_tag = True\r\n```\r\nis never  executed since the `line.startswith(\"@classlabel\")` is `False`\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nHow should the tag \"@classlabel\" be named,  `write_ndarray_to_tsfile` and `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe` depend on each other here. Another solution would be to allow multiple way of writing this tag in `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe`\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3303/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1221509810","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2043#issuecomment-1221509810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2043","id":1221509810,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5IzsKy","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-21T09:41:55Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T09:42:15Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"FYI @paulbauriegel, @achieveordie, @TNTran92.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3303\r\nwrite/load were inconsistent since they seemed to assume minimally different format specificaitons (identifier strings).\r\n\r\nI think we should document the file format properly.\r\n\r\n@paulbauriegel, @achieveordie, you looked recently into loaders/writers, so you are probably the resident experts on the ts, tsf file formats? The original authors have disengaged, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe output could be a formal rst page in the docs - or a markdown, if rst is too much of a hassle. We can convert it to \"nice\" doc format later, I feel it would be key to have the format written down somewhere or we will keep discovering bugs like #3303
