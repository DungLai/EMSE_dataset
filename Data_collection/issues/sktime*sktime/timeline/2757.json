If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nAre the assumptions for index types valid? I believe `get_window` is implicitly making the same assumptions.\r\n\r\nIf they are valid, can we amend the examples so series/ dfs have a timestamp index by default for testing?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2761/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
