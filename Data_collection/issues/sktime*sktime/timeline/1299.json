If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis is the first draft, so any. functionality suggestions are very welcome. The idea is to start with \"hard-coded\" autogenerated `self.forecasters`, get this working and then update so that they can be passed by users in the constructor.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are.

In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of
