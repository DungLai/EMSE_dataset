But I thought maybe someone who proposed this algorithm in past might have reasoned it in terms of code design. Because a lot of design decisions in beginning were affected by how individual contributors thought of using Sktime with whatever data they had. I call it the \"curse_of_air_passengers_data\" for load_airline() dataset (because then everywhere defaults are like 12 assuming the ts is always monthly and so on). So I think, during that developer assumed that fh will always be 12, so lets stack it using self.fh. \r\n\r\nAnyway that has to be changed somehow! maybe using test_size parameter as is used in AutoEnsembleForecaster instead of salvaging the same fh everywhere. Because for stacking regressor one should be able to use a different fh than the fh passed to the individual forecasters. But we can discuss that in one of friday meetings.\r\n\r\nBut my doubts go even further. The fit result of both StackingForecaster and AutoEnsembleForecaster is same. The result of predict() method is different for the two. Since I found it strange I created the discussion Q&A, to get some answers from community.  \r\n\r\nSo until we get concrete answers there, we have also created a user story on our side to check the effectiveness of StackingForecaster against AutoEnsembleForecaster. Our first idea is to check whether for a big fh like > 12, does it achieve comparable performance. \r\n\r\nMy expectations are to get answers like:\r\n- either we need StackingForecaster and it makes sense to use it under such and such conditions\r\n- or StackingForecaster is consistently worse than AutoEnsembleForecaster. In that case I would then recommend to remove this class from sktime.\r\n\r\nSo whatever is the outcome, I will share after June as it is planned for next iteration. Until then lets try to make StackingForecaster sensical code-wise and theory wise.\r\n\r\n@danbartl Maybe your thoughts will be useful here? As you have worked with sklearn regressors like GBM in past days. Could you check the StackingForecaster class and share your opinion whether it makes sense to stack forecasters like the way it is proposed in the code? For sensical code, I would ask you to check in stack-fix branch as per
