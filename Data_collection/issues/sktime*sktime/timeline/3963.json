PR isolates `numba` throughout `sktime`.\r\n\r\nNote: does *not* turn `numba` into a soft dependency.\r\n\r\nThis is required for all approaches to making `sktime` python 3.11 compatible as long as `numba` is not python 3.11 compatible, because that requires being able to run the framework components of `sktime` without `numba` imports.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3963.\r\n\r\nThe general recipe to isolate `numba`:\r\n\r\n* move `numba` imports into functions and classes, where possible\r\n* where loose functions are decorated with `jit` and `njit`, move them to a private module `_orig_modulename_numba`, and move imports of that into functions or classes\r\n* add the package dependency tag to `numba` dependent estimators to isolate them\r\n* use `pytest.skipif` to conditionally skip `numba` dependent non-suite tests if `numba` is not installed\r\n\r\nMakes the following changes:\r\n* changes the `test_module_softdeps` test to ignore private modules (starting with `_`), i.e., to not require a user warning. This is ok since users are not expected to import private modules.\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3857","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3631/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
