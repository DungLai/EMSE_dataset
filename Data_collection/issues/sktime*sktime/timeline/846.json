I am with @mloning and think it would be useful to include the underlying functionality as transformers and then use the transformers in the plot call. \r\n\r\nI also really like @SinghShreya05's idea to include the ability to include a parameter for the type of plot to return. But I think we should generalize this rather than have it specific to plotting image transformations. \r\n\r\nWe've got PR's to add several other types of plots. (See #850, #802, #681) and a plot to show seasonality would also be useful for exploratory data analysis. It would be nice to be able to choose one of the image transformation plots or the plots from these other PRs.\r\n\r\nA simple approach (we'd need a better name) would be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef wrapper_plot(*series, plot_type=\"standard\", **kwargs)\r\n    # Some input checking here\r\n    if plot_type == \"standard\": \r\n        plot_series(*series, **kwargs)\r\n    elif plot_type == \"correlation\":\r\n        plot_correlations(*series, **kwargs)\r\n    elif plot_type == \"recurrance\":\r\n        plot_recurrance(*series, **kwargs)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n@mloning and @SinghShreya05's what are your thoughts on breaking this Issue up into two PRs? \r\n\r\n1. Add transformers and plotting functions for the timeseries image transformation plots\r\n2. Create a wrapper function for plotting so that users could call that function and simply tell it what type of plot to make\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/841860450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4751291091,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc1MTI5MTA5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4751291091","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-16T18:52:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4751291092,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NTEyOTEwOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4751291092","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-16T18:52:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4751291093,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc1MTI5MTA5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4751291093","actor":{"login":"SinghShreya05","id":50830709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODMwNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50830709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05","html_url":"https://github.com/SinghShreya05","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghShreya05/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-16T18:52:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4751291094,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NTEyOTEwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4751291094","actor":{"login":"SinghShreya05","id":50830709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODMwNzA5","avatar_url":

sounds good! \r\n\r\nI'm not very familiar with the image transformation plots, but given that they are implemented in `pyts` I think they are used in time series classification settings, so we should make sure that they run on panel data (multiple series) too. Not sure if we want to implement them as a panel transformer directly or wrap a series transformer. We may also need a new transformer type depending on the output type of them (e.g. `SeriesToImage`)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/844791166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4771166487,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc3MTE2NjQ4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4771166487","actor":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-20T07:22:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4771166496,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NzExNjY0OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4771166496","actor":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-20T07:22:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
