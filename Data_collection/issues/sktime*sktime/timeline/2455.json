PR fixes three interacting bugs, causing #2455:\r\n\r\n* an error in the `scitype` utility where None would be returned instead of a list of scitype in a case where the passed estimator was type polymorphic (had multiple scitypes). This is fixed.\r\n* an error in the forecasting pipelines constructor check that would consider another forecasting pipeline as type-less and hence raise an error, because forecasting pipelines were expected to be constructed with transformers or forecasters. This is fixed by changing the default behaviour of `scitype` to what was assumed (just one type is returned).\r\n* Since the `scitype` would come back empty for the `TransformedTargetForecaster`, no scenarios would be found in testing, because retrieval was based on the `scitype` utility. Now, with the change, scenarios are retrieved, and more tests are run, which (without fix) would fail, since tests for transformers are also run due to the polymorphism. This is remedied by removing transformer inheritance from `TransformedTargetForecaster` for now.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds:\r\n* a test for constructing a nested pipeline to ensure the functionality/ability of nesting pipelines does not get broken in the future.\r\n* functionality to the `scitypes` function that forces it to return only a single scitype. Ties are resolved by the order in which the scitypes appear in the register, which prefers forecasters above transformers. This is enabled by default, as it was assumed by all references.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6429966719,"node_id":"COE_lADOCVKAsc5HvhXTzwAAAAF_QYF_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6429966719","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-13T19:52:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1100878653","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2455#issuecomment-1100878653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2455","id":1100878653,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5BnhM9","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-17T13:44:28Z","updated_at":"2022-04-17T13:44:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI...I

Describe the feature you want to add to this project\n\nThe current time series pipeline is a custom pipeline based on `ForecstingPipeline` from `sktime`. This had to be built since in 0.10.1 version of `sktime`, `transform` method was not implemented for `ForecstingPipeline`. This means that we need to maintain the pipeline code in pycaret now instead of `sktime`\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nThe 0.11.2 version of `sktime` has implemented the transform (though there is a [bug in it](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2455) which should be resolved shortly). Once this is released, update pycaret pipeline to use `sktime` `ForecastingPipeline` instead of subclassing it in `pycaret`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nContinue with existing solution as a workaround until this is implemented.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pycaret/pycaret/issues/2449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pycaret/pycaret/issues/2449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6516672975,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5HvhXTzwAAAAGEbInP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6516672975","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-28T16:37:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6516673185,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5HvhXTzwAAAAGEbIqh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6516673185","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1b6a9416aad3e975059e2728ebfaef9c5abd3503","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/1b6a9416aad3e975059e2728ebfaef9c5abd3503","created_at":"2022-04-28T16:37:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6516978857,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5HvhXTzwAAAAGEcTSp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6516978857","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-28T17:24:31Z","project_card":{"id":80939034,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/80939034","project_id":14035628,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/14035628","column_name":"Done","previous_column_name":"Must have"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
