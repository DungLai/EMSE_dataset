Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2441\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nAdd prediction intervals for the `UnobservedComponents` model wrapper from `statsmodels`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThe functionality is just taken from `statsmodels` itself as described in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2441 so its mainly that the implementation works as expected. This PR takes as a base the existing implementation for the `ETS`  forecaster, for comparison  see the method [`_predict_interval`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/ets.py#L407).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [DOC] or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, documentation or bug\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6439329163,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5HgKlAzwAAAAF_0F2L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6439329163","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-15T08:17:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6439329309,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5HgKlAzwAAAAF_0F4d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6439329309","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a5bc0930fca040177e8518d0cbe2f271e1108e8a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/a5bc0930fca040177e8518d0cbe2f271e1108e8a","created_at":"2022-04-15T08:17:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
