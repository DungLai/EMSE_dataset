your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe `DateTimeFeatures` and `TimeSince` transformer are a lot slower and takes up a lot more memory than expected when working with pandas Periods. I think this is due to some of the type checking happening in the `transform` method rather than the implementation in the `_transform` method. On large datasets (e.g., M5 dataset) my kernel surprisingly dies when using `DateTimeFeatures`. \r\n\r\nHere is an example to show the issue:\r\n ```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.date import DateTimeFeatures\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.time_since import TimeSince\r\n\r\n# Create time series with datetime index\r\nts_datetime = pd.DataFrame(data={\"y\":np.random.rand(50000)},\r\n                        index=pd.date_range(start=\"2000-01-01\", freq=\"D\", periods=50000))\r\n\r\n# Create time series with period index\r\nts_period = pd.DataFrame(data={\"y\":np.random.rand(50000)},\r\n                        index=pd.period_range(start=\"2000-01-01\", freq=\"D\", periods=50000))\r\n\r\n# Instantiate transformers\r\ndate_time_transformer = DateTimeFeatures(manual_selection=[\r\n    \"day_of_month\",\r\n    \"month_of_year\",\r\n    \"day_of_week\",\r\n])\r\n\r\ntime_since_transformer = TimeSince()\r\n\r\n# Select timeseries with datetime or period index\r\nts = ts_period\r\n\r\n# Fit transformers\r\ndate_time_transformer.fit(ts)\r\ntime_since_transformer.fit(ts)\r\n\r\n# Time the runs\r\n%%timeit\r\nresults = time_since_transformer.transform(ts)\r\n# 3.66 s ± 199 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n\r\n%%timeit\r\nresults = time_since_transformer._transform(ts)\r\n# 184 ms ± 4.48 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n\r\n%%timeit\r\nresult = date_time_transformer.transform(ts)\r\n# 3.41 s ± 131 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n\r\n%%timeit\r\nresult = date_time_transformer._transform(ts)\r\n# 24 ms ± 9.31 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe time difference between running `transform` and `_transform` when the time series has a `PeriodIndex` are large (e.g., for `DateTimeFeatures` there is over a factor of 100 in the execution time).  \r\n\r\nThis issue does not seem to occur when the index is a `DatetimeIndex`. \r\n\r\n**Version**\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.7 (default, May  6 2021, 21:53:45)  [Clang 12.0.0

PR fixes #3990; related PR: #3827. FYI @KishManani, @danbartl.\r\n\r\nCombining information from @danbartl and @KishManani, I understood where the issue must have been coming from - from a line of `np.diff` on the checked index, in `_index_equally_spaced`, but only in the case of `pd.PeriodIndex` (the latter condition I only understood from @KishManani's analysis).\r\n\r\nI have used this insight to replace the time and memory consuming check by a much quicker one, exploiting mathematical assumptions on the `pd.PeriodIndex` (unique and sorted index).\r\n\r\nWhile this PR seems to address the issue, some open questions remain:\r\n\r\n* do we want to test this fix, or in general, checks being fast and not memory intensive? If yes, how? Runtimes can vary even on VM.\r\n* is @danbartl's fix in https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3935 redundant or complementary? It seems to address hierarchical and panel types primarily, so I could imagine it either makes no difference, or helps speed up things if the series check is fast.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3991/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8130570957,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5XAkbgzwAAAAHknqrN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8130570957","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e13e95f662372fee927f7d1a19bafc03d53519d6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/e13e95f662372fee927f7d1a19bafc03d53519d6","created_at":"2022-12-30T14:06:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8139057714,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5XAkbgzwAAAAHlICoy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8139057714","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1257ec2532ff8003e538205287860a0001ee2942","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/1257ec2532ff8003e538205287860a0001ee2942","created_at":"2023-01-02T20:44:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
