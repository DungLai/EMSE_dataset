If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.

[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for

PR fixes #2556, the `update_predict` state handling bug, by replacing the `detached_cutoff` by a call of `deepcopy` and working with the deep copy.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary fix which ensures correctness - long-term we should probably deprecate the `update_predict` behaviour that resets the `cutoff`.\r\n\r\nOne secondary problem was that some tests for the online forecaster were *assuming* the behaviour that was problematic in #2556, i.e,. that the inner state *does* get updated by `update_predict`.\r\nThis was accounted for by adding a `reset_forecaster` argument to `update_predict`, which can be used to switch between the two behaviours currently assumed in the code base, of `update_predict`.\r\n\r\nDocstrings have also been added to clarify what `update_predict` actually does.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2557/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6524619305,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5Ig0sVzwAAAAGE5cop","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6524619305","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-29T16:06:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6524619455,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5Ig0sVzwAAAAGE5cq_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6524619455","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-29T16:06:06Z","project_card":{"id":81164612,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/81164612","project_id":5198515,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/5198515","column_name":"Fixed/resolved","previous_column_name":"Needs
