15 meeting notes here:\r\nhttps://hackmd.io/uymslbTLQSiteSBrNWOptw\r\n\r\nSnapshot:\r\n\r\n## previous material\r\n\r\ninput-output. (also includes some discussion on base class design)\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/discussions/2848\r\n\r\nannotation STEP\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/06_time_series_annotation/step.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## consolidation of conceptual model\r\n\r\nsummary of input-output discussion (Mirae)\r\n\r\n* models should be able to output \"dense\" output format\r\n    * \"sparse\" is also useful, can obtain from \"dense\"\r\n* preference towards pandas objects\r\n    * numpy does not have indexing or special formats\r\n* what should output be\r\n    * how to represent segment, \"classification\" or segmentation\r\n* one or separate base classes?\r\n    * segmentation\r\n    * anomaly detection\r\n    * score value vs \"anomaly\" or \"segment\"\r\n    * have different outputs\r\n* predict vs transform?\r\n    * Hidalgo - looks more like `transform` than `predict`\r\n    * distinction could be supervised or unsupervised\r\n    * logic in predict or transform - usefulness question, where better\r\n* composable input/output checks?\r\n    * conversion functionality vs copy-pasted boilerplate\r\n    * composable conversion functionality?\r\n    * FK: is this orthogonal to BaseAnnotator? I.e., is this sth we can sort out in the consolidated classes (BaseForecaster etc), instead of experimenting with it in the BaseAnnotator\r\n        * design rationale: divide & conquer, not introducing too many new ideas/concerns at the same time\r\n        * Mirae: agrees that it is orthogonal to BaseAnnotator, might be worth separating discussions and keeping with sktime patterns existing\r\n    * alternative to \"checker\" part of the tag system\r\n\r\nLovkush:\r\n\r\n* suggest to start with smaller set of tasks, e.g., unsupervised, non-panel\r\n\r\nFK: \r\n* `fit`?\r\n* `predict` or `transform`?\r\n* how many base classes\r\n\r\nUnsupervised annotators could be transformers\r\nInherit from `BaseTransformer`?\r\n\r\nMirae:\r\ninherit from sth like `BaseTransformer` or `BaseEstimator`\r\n\r\n\r\n## open API questions / API proposals\r\n\r\n\r\nlet´s think about:\r\n\r\n* target design (sketch)\r\n* plan of attack (how to we get there?)\r\n* pros/cons, e.g., \"completely new\" vs \"easy to adapt\" etc\r\n\r\n### Franz\r\n\r\n* needs to inherit from `BaseObject`, this is non-negotiable (95% sure), or it will not be compatible with rest of sktime, e.g., transformers - rest is negotiable\r\n* bootstrap current `BaseAnnotator`\r\n    * morally, keep public signature (only minor changes)\r\n    * \"upgrade\" to current `sktime` patterns, e.g., tags\r\n* start with single (non-panel) case only\r\n* try to deal with both unsupervised and supervised\r\n    * unsupervised: should have `transform`\r\n    * supervised: has `predict`\r\n        * KB: unsupervised doesn't always mean `transform`, the way I consider it (e.g. Hidalgo is an unsupervised transform, whereas k-means clustering is an unsupervised predict - the distintion lies with the purpose of the algorithm - can you predict temporally on unseen data)\r\n* slightly lean towards splitting base class in two: transformer-like annotators, supervised estimator like annotators\r\n    * should transformer-like annotators inherit from `BaseTransformer`\r\n* deal with dense/sparse by base class boilerplate - i.e., do not force the developer to implement both. Tag for \"which is implemented\"\r\n    * possibly: special mtyps for annotations - segmentations, change point labels, etc\r\n    * mtype conversion could do the dense/sparse conversion\r\n* add conversion boilerplate similar to `BaseForecaster`, but not too much\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n* exploration of composable checkers is valuable, but should be done separately. Would base that on `visions`\r\n\r\n\r\nPros-cons:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* follows rest of `sktime`, pattern-wise\r\n* mostly cut/paste/reuse job, probably higher return on work time than re-design from scratch\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* too heavy? too heavy too early?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Katie\r\n* in the existing `BaseSeriesAnnotator`, labels : str {\"indicator\", \"score\"} could instead be output_mtype : bool or float, since it is really describing the output type\r\n* let us please use `y` instead of `Y`! :D\r\n* do we need to separate `predict` and `predict_scores` i.e. when `output_mtype = float` we know it is a score?\r\n* pro of completley new: starting with simplicity in mind\r\n\r\n\r\nKB: the distinction transform/predict type is whether or not you can make some inference on future data (based on some fitted params or priors) i.e. Hidalgo -> transforms, k-means can predict (given the central points of clusters)\r\n\r\nFK: makes distinction transform/predict type annotator, by whether remembers state or not - not by whether ground truth is available\r\n\r\nMirae: predict is more \"forecast\", i.e., next item in the sequence\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mirae\r\n\r\n* how - as a first step I think it makes sense to work on modifying existing `BaseAnnotator`. Its actually still pretty light, but does seem half finished. Wouldn't break current annotators that inherit.\r\n* lets be more specific in design of enforcing the assumptions we have made here - should reduce the amount of code overhead (eg, can just check that it is pandas dataframe input/output, don't need to worry about other scitypes).\r\n* Other than implementing checks for these simple assumptions my preference would be to make `BaseAnnotator` as light as possible.\r\n* Should we flesh out the current tags system? \r\n* Lets write an extension template for BaseAnnotator as well?\r\n* My preference would be for one type of annotator base class.  Is it worth having something like `label` rather than `predict` or `transform`?  (or is this just bad from a scikit learn compatibility perspective?

predict in the mathematical sense). \r\n\r\nBecause both an Annotator and a Transformer are just some function `f : n x m -> n x 1` that maps to a vector, the distinction I suggested is whether or not the params depend on each row `f(θ_n)` e.g. Hidalgo, or the params are generalised `f(θ)` and we can therefore make inferences about new data e.g. k-means clustering with centre points, HMM with

Sorry if I did not note this down clearly.\r\n\r\n> Because both an Annotator and a Transformer are just some function `f : n x m -> n x 1` that maps to a vector\r\n\r\nRegarding this, I think this is not entirely correct, and the issue is along a common but subtle misconception.\r\n\r\nTransformers and predictors (supervised tabular estimators in sklearn), *when already fit*, have `transform` and `predict` behave like a function $f : \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}$. But this function is dependent on the state, e.g., model parameters, which are fit (computed) in `fit`, so what we actually have is a family of parametric functions $f_\\theta : \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}$, and a `fit` that produces $\\theta$, i.e., a function $g : \\mathbb{R}^{n' \\times m} \\rightarrow \\Theta$ (transformers) or $g : \\mathbb{R}^{n' \\times m} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n' \\times 1} \\rightarrow \\Theta$ (predictors), for some parameter domain $\\Theta$.\r\n\r\nIn math terms, the typical workflow is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

me its still not clear what annotation is, I dont see it as a new learning problem but as how you use existing learning problems like transformation, regression, classification and forecasting (intrapolation). Annotation seems to be research marketing but not a new learning problem - at least not a new base class? I think we should be really cautious here and not create an artificial learning problem.\r\n\r\nAnnotation in natural words is for me sth like \"creating an information about an existing data\" (e.g. outliers, changepoints, level shifts) but this can be covered with existing learning problems and interfaces we already have, most likely most things that are seen as annotation algorithms can be implemented as transformers. Btw we already have an \"annotation\" algorithm for outliers which is `HampelFilter` and this is also implemented as a transformer. If there is a need for any additional functionality, we could rather create a composition that is handling it instead a new base class? Also `sklearn` doesnt have an annotation base class or not even a module, if annotation exists for time series data, it should also exist for tabular data?\r\n\r\nwhat do you think? @KatieBuc
