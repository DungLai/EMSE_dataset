All,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to implement a classifier on multidimensional Timeseries data based on nearest neighbor classifier.

implements #1888 - arithmetics over variables is separated in this implementation, due to different implementation requirements (sub-setting over variables, etc) which would over-complicate the signature if exposed in a single class.\r\nThis can also be leveraged towards dunders, see #1886.\r\n\r\nImplements a `CombinedDistance` which takes multiple distances and produces the distance that is obtained from combining them via a numpy reducer style operation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7184471088,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc5B8HKlzwAAAAGsOlQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7184471088","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-14T10:10:13Z","label":{"name":"module:distances","color":"FD4F8F"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7184471525,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOCVKAsc5B8HKlzwAAAAGsOlXl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7184471525","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-14T10:10:36Z","label":{"name":"module:dists_and_kerns","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7227040396,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5B8HKlzwAAAAGuw-KM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7227040396","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cd990c8aca9af0bce872612b47bcfd5ebcb16916","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/cd990c8aca9af0bce872612b47bcfd5ebcb16916","created_at":"2022-08-21T00:56:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
