your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nA recently proposed distance based approach to TSC is called ShapeDTW\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320317303710\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nShapeDTW is basically a composition of a transformer and DTW. The transformer convert a univariate series into a multivariate one, and the form of DTW employed is DTW_D. This requires\r\n1) implement transformer\r\n2) implement multivariate dependent DTW\r\nthis should then slot into the existing structure, we can just wrap the published classifier as a pipeline

project.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-02T14:52:02Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T14:52:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/329","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/329/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/329/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/329/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/329","id":649974497,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDQzNTUyOTYw","number":329,"title":"Fixed
