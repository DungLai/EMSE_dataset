about some time series regression metrics which are not present in scikit-learn? So far, scikit-learn has the MAPE. This measure has some serious shortcomings, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error#Issues). If you are interested in this topic, the following could be good additions:\r\n\r\n## Mean directional accuracy\r\nI think this one is especially interesting when you only want to predict the direction of your time series correctly. Up or down nothing else. A classic problem to apply this is when dealing with the prediction of stock prices. I don't really care if my model can tell me if the stock price rises by 10% or 20%, it's important that it rises. And the model won't output accurate percentages anyway. It makes it potentially easier to design a well-performing model according to this metric.\r\n\r\n## Logarithm of the accuracy ratio\r\n[Here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2635088), the author explains why it is a good measure. What I like about this measure: Usually, the MAPE punishes over and underestimating differently. If the actual value A is 2 and the forecast F is 1, the APE here is 0.5. If A=2 and F=4, the APE is 1. Two different scores, although the prediction is half or double the actual value, and I would like these errors to be the same. The Logarithm of the accuracy ratio does exactly that (0.48 in both cases). (By the way, the Mean directional accuracy does this, too.)\r\n\r\nAnother nice property is that the best constant prediction for some label vector y is the geometric mean of y. This is analog to the mean, which is the best constant prediction for the MSE metric, or the median for the MAD metric.\r\n\r\n[You can find my implementations here.](https://github.com/Garve/scikit-bonus/blob/master/skbonus/metrics/_regression.py)\r\n\r\nIf you like, I can do a pull request.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRobert","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4503513630,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ1MDM1MTM2MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4503513630","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-24T18:05:29Z","label":{"name":"good first issue","color":"9eff91"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/806254235","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/745#issuecomment-806254235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/745","id":806254235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNjI1NDIzNQ==","user":{"login":"ayushjain9501","id":42704976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzA0OTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42704976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501","html_url":"https://github.com/ayushjain9501","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayushjain9501/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T23:44:31Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T23:44:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nI am interested in contributing here.

and @fkiraly don't want to make things more confusing, but my memory is fuzzy on our discussion. \r\n\r\nAbout the assumption that the input `y_pred` would be real valued or categorical. \r\n\r\nThe more I'm thinking about it, having `y_pred` be real valued at input makes more sense because real valued `y_pred` is needed (along with bins) to calculate the \"increase\" or \"decrease\" (or more generally the binned categories, but up/down is easier to talk about so I use that below too). \r\n\r\nWhether or not the prediction is an \"increase\" or \"decrease\" is generally determined by looking at `y_pred[t] - y_true[t-fh]` where `fh` is the horizon of interest. Note that for the first `fh` values in the dataset, you'd also need to be looking back into `y_train` to determine whether an increase or decrease occurred (but passing y_train is straight-forward now that we've merged #858). \r\n\r\nI've also got 2 clarification questions on the forecaster side of things: \r\nIn the initial post we mention:\r\n\r\n> - reducer from Forecaster to DirectionalForecaster via time-series/tabular classification\r\n> - reducer from Forecaster to DirectionalForecaster via output binning\r\n\r\nWas the intention for 2 new (non-public) classes (one for each bullet above)? Then a `make_directional_forecaster(..., type ='binned')` or `make_directional_forecaster(..., type='tsc')` for the actual reduction?\r\n\r\nAlso, for the `DirectionalForecaster` do we want predict to return a directional forecast or do we want that to return real values and we could implement the directional prediction via something a method like `predict_direction()`? Idea would be to make it kind of like how scikit-learn has `predict_proba()`. I guess the opposite could be true too -- `predict()` could predict the directional class in `DirectionalForecaster` but we could include a `predict_real` to predict real values in the output binning reduction case (real values wouldn't make sense in the time-series classification reduction case). \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/857284812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
