issue https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2654, initial suggestion by @fkiraly\r\n\r\nhere's a suggestion on this question:\r\n\r\n> whether `__call__` should live directly in `sktime`, or in `pywatts`. If not in `sktime`, how could it possibly work after import?\r\n\r\nI think a good solution would be the following:\r\n* `GraphPipeline` lives in `pywatts`, but is `sktime` compatible\r\n* `pywatts` is an `sktime` soft dependency, localized to `__call__`\r\n* `sktime` is a `pywatts` soft dependency, for base class (parent of `GraphPipeline`?) and testing\r\n* testing for `GraphPipeline` uses `sktime` `check_estimator`\r\n* `sktime` base classes implement high-level `__call__` logic, i.e., constructing the `GraphPipeline`\r\n* `sktime` base classes import `pywatts` `GraphPipeline` internally in `__call__`, errors are raised via `_check_soft_dependency`. This is similar to how the other dunders import a specific compositor class, e.g., `*` of `BaseTransformer` importing the `TransformerPipeline`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1178920293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6959704010,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5NbED0zwAAAAGe1KfK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6959704010","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-08T12:14:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6959704016,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5NbED0zwAAAAGe1KfQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6959704016","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-08T12:14:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1178922453","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2956#issuecomment-1178922453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2956","id":1178922453,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5GRO3V","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-08T12:17:13Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T12:17:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@kalebphipps
