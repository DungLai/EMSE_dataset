PR adds functionality in `VectorizedDF` to vectorize across columns/variables.\r\n\r\n* adds an `iterate_cols` arg to the `VectorizedDF` constructor which enables vectorization across columns.\r\n* changes `get_iter_indices` to produce row/column indices for subsetting\r\n* relaxes requirements on scitypes so that `iterate_as` and `is_scitype` can be equal, i.e., when iteration/vectorization is only over columns and not of rows\r\n* tests are kept for regression testing, only negative tests are relaxed where previously `iterate_as=is_scitype` was tested to raise an error\r\n* tests are extended to also test column vectorization\r\n* since the interface of `get_iter_indices` changed to return cols/rows, counter-adaptation in the `BaseForecaster` and `BaseTransformer` were necessary. In the future, this should be refactored into an \"apply-to\" interface of `VectorizedDF`, there is repetitive boilerplate and logic that should not be in the base classes. Deprecation is not necessary since the public interfaces of the base classes did not change.\r\n\r\nThis PR is needed to addess https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2547 for univariate/multivariate, see #2865.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6923770067,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5IWILVzwAAAAGcsFjT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6923770067","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0ac21dd5339c852c8afc52ef50e93e800eb46432","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/0ac21dd5339c852c8afc52ef50e93e800eb46432","created_at":"2022-07-03T20:59:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6936320580,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5IWILVzwAAAAGdb9pE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6936320580","actor":{"login":"tobiasweede","id":14060368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDYwMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14060368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasweede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasweede/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e5edec67d3e8e12eb5365244fc921c28be5a161e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tobiasweede/sktime/commits/e5edec67d3e8e12eb5365244fc921c28be5a161e","created_at":"2022-07-05T17:43:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
