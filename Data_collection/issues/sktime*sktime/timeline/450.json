Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nInterface and wrap stumpy.stump in series-to-series transformer.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo hard dependency, but stumpy is introduced as soft dependency\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
