your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI would like to add a backtesting class. We should ideally then also implement an expanding window splitter functionality as discussed in #552 . But the `Backtest` would just receive a splitter as an argument.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA class like `Backtest` (naming to be discussed) with a signature like this:\r\n```python\r\nclass Backtest(object):\r\n    \"\"\"Backtest forecasters\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    forecaster: estimator object\r\n    splitter: splitter object\r\n        e.g. SlidingWindowSplitter\r\n    score: function\r\n        A function like smape_loss that has y_pred, y_test as arguments and returns a float\r\n\r\n    Returns\r\n    ----------\r\n    error: float\r\n        Average error of fitted estimators calculated by means of the score function\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe class should have a `fit()` function like a regular estimator object. I guess a `predict()` function does not make sense here. The class will be able to also take a `forecaster` of type `ForecastingGridSearchCV`, as in production people might refit and tune the model by progress in time.\r\n\r\nOptionally, the class can print the number of fits, like in `ForecastingGridSearchCV` when fitting.\r\n\r\nI am not sure on how to structure the return and what else should be returned, I guess just return `self` and have the rest as class variables? We could do sth like in `ForecastingGridSearchCV` with the `cv_results_` variable, so we could also store there the errors, predictions  and also the params of each iteration (because params might differ when using a grid search as forecaster).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29627036/104709492-4ea57100-571f-11eb-9311-bf3920db1bcf.png)\r\n\r\nWhere should a class `Backtest` be placed in the `sktime` class structure?
