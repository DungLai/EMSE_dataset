See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged.

Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nWhen using a forecaster to impute data, the class `Imputer` was passing all the points to `forecaster.predict()`. This could throw the error \"ValueError: In-sample predictions undefined for start=0 when d=1\" when using `forecaster = AutoARIMA()`.

If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nNothing in particular.\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass

\r\nokay so I made a piece of code to make it work for the case when given elements of ForcastingHorizon that can't be predicted (when arima order > 0) while also raising an error if ever asked to forecast for something before the train data. However there's a small problem with intervals. When `return_pred_int` is false, `_predict_in_sample` returns a pd.Series but when it's True, it return a tuple (pd.Series, pd.DataFrame) which raises the append error. Note that this issue is from the current sktime version (I ran it on colab to make sure) and is only asking for values that can be predicted. Should I correct it in the same PR ? (it's just a two line of code). I made a separate issue for it #1441

#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #859 and #1441 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nWhen training an AutoArima you don't know what differencing order it'll land at so if data changes at some point you won't be able to do in sample forecasts for some points (earlier to diff order). This implementation makes predictions possible (without errors) if they're ealier to differencing order.\r\nIt also fixes a small problem with appending out of sample to in sample predictions when intervals are to be returned.\r\n\r\n> #### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNope\r\n\r\n> #### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nif the code is clear enough, if the comments should be left.\r\n\r\n> #### PR checklist\r\n\r\n\r\n> ##### For all contributions\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n> ##### For new estimators\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5396369482,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc40PFX4zwAAAAFBphBK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5396369482","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T19:22:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
