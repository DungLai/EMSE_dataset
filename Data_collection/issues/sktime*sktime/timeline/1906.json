'unavailable_module' is a soft dependency and not included in the sktime installation. Please run: `pip install unavailable_module`. To install all soft dependencies, run: `pip install sktime[all_extras]`\r\n\r\nI don't understand what you mean by `folder_name` ?\r\nThe message simply asks to pip install the package name (string) passed as argument in `_check_soft_dependencies(*packages)`\r\nfrom `/sktime/utils/validation/_dependencies.py`\r\n\r\nI would like to understand more on:\r\n1. What's difference between `pypi_name` and `folder_name` ?\r\nBecause as per my understanding, if we pass the pypi_name when calling `_check_soft_dependencies(\"pypi_name\")` we will get the required recommendation.\r\n2. Where are we using `_check_soft_dependencies(\"folder_name\")` (if possible)? and can we simply achieve the goal by using \"pypi_name\" instead of \"folder_name\" while calling the _check_soft_dependencies ?\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I'm new to open source (would like to start my journey from this issue) and this is my first ever comment on github. So let me know if I am violating any code of conduct or if I am thinking in completely wrong direction.

@fkiraly \r\nHow about we store the pypi packages name of the libraries in a dictionary like this:\r\n```\r\n_PYPI_PACKAGES = {\r\n    \"dtw\":\"dtw-python\"\r\n}\r\nin the format:\r\ndict = {\r\n    \"folder-name\" : \"pypi-name\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\ninside the `sktime/sktime/utils/validation/_dependencies.py` where `_check_soft_dependencies(*packages)` is defined.\r\n\r\nbecause we need to map the folder-names to their PYPI names while recommending the pip install message.\r\n\r\nI tried to dive deeper into code base and found that in `sktime/build_tools/azure/check_soft_dependencies.py` we have a `SOFT_DEPENDENCIES` dictionary. So I was thinking if we make the _PYPI_PACKAGES dictionary for each soft dependency mentioned here.\r\n\r\nThen we will have all the correct pairs of pypi-name and folder-name in a dictionary and in the message we can print `\"pip install {_PYPI_PACKAGES[package]}\"` if it exists else simply print \"pip install {package}\"\r\n\r\nThe list of all the soft dependencies I could find is: \r\n```\r\n[\r\n'dtw',\r\n 'esig',\r\n 'fbprophet',\r\n 'hcrystalball',\r\n 'matplotlib',\r\n 'pmdarima',\r\n 'stumpy',\r\n 'tbats',\r\n 'tsfresh'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I would like to know:\r\n\r\n1. Is this approach fine? \r\n2. If yes, then are there more soft dependencies with name conflicts like dtw and dtw-python? I manually tried to search for all the above mentioned soft dependencies on pypi.org and all looked like they won't have such conflicts except for `tsfresh` and `tsfresh-ppi` (just in case but tsfresh-ppi doesn't look relevant).\r\n3.
