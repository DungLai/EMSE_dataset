support for non-unit frequencies (eg: 30 minutes) by parsing the pandas frequency and extracting the relevant values to pass on to pd.Timedelta().\r\n\r\nThis works for frequencies like `D` and `3D`, as demonstrated by the test.\r\n\r\nThis does not work with [anchored offsets](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html#anchored-offsets), like the `W-SUN` mentioned in #866, as it's not immediately obvious to me how one would construct a correct Timedelta from this. I suspect that the anchor can simply be dropped (7 days are 7 days, no matter whether they start on Sunday or Monday), but I'm not entirely sure, and I had a hard time constructing a test example.\r\n\r\nFixes:
