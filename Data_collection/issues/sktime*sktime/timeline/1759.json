Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR instructions related to soft dependencies will be added to extension template and documentation\r\n<!--\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n<!-- \r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n<!--\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are.
