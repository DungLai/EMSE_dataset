Explain your changes.\r\nDocumented example of installing sktime on Windows, specifically using PyCharm and Anaconda with extensive screenshots to guide new users. While PyCharm is used as the IDE, instructions are separated out so that just the environment instructions can be followed (i.e. Section 2) without need for PyCharm, if preferred.  \r\n\r\nThe notebook is in examples/windows_installation.ipynb and the other files that have been added are screenshots that are used within the notebook. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nNo code introduced has been introduced but I'm not sure if this is the correct place for it - it may be better in the \\docs but I'm not sure how best to include the images and have used a notebook as a first pass. Also, please comment on whether the instructions are informative or if you have suggestions for any changes\r\n\r\n#### Any other
