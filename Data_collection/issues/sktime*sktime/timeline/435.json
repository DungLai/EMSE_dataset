@discdiver , thank you for raising the issue.\r\n\r\nThis error occurs as the seasonal period `sp` is not specified while calling AutoETS, and using `AutoETS(auto=True, sp=12)` for example would work (same as the implementation in the forecasting example notebook).\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that we implemented AutoETS based on statsmodels' [ETSModel](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.tsa.exponential_smoothing.ets.ETSModel.html). In statsmodels' [source code](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/_modules/statsmodels/tsa/exponential_smoothing/ets.html#ETSModel), the seasonal period is automatically picked up from the dataset itself when `sp` is not specified through conversion from the `_index_freq` (frequency of the time-series) attribute of the dataset.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, sktime currently does not have seasonal period embedded in its datasets yet. @mloning would you please confirm this and suggest if we have better ways to fix it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/711976059/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HYang1996","id":44179303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5MzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996","html_url":"https://github.com/HYang1996","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HYang1996/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3892541345,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg5MjU0MTM0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3892541345","actor":{"login":"discdiver","id":7703961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDM5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7703961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver","html_url":"https://github.com/discdiver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-19T10:08:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3892541355,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4OTI1NDEzNTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3892541355","actor":{"login":"discdiver","id":7703961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDM5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7703961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver","html_url":"https://github.com/discdiver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/discdiver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-19T10:08:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3892541366,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg5MjU0MTM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3892541366","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-19T10:08:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3892541377,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4OTI1NDEzNzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3892541377","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.gi

@HYang1996!\r\n\r\nWhy does statsmodels not raise a more informative error here if the period cannot be inferred from `freq` in `period_to_freq`? `freq` is just an attribute on a `pd.PeriodIndex` or `pd.DatetimeIndex`. \r\n\r\nWe could change the default to `sp=1` .
