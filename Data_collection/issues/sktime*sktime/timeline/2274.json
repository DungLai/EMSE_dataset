y":"@lmmentel I think the problem is that the links are doing multiple jobs at the same time. On nbviewer, the links work because the hyperlink tags are interpreted correctly. However, on the actual docs page [here](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/examples/01_forecasting.html#Table-of-Contents), I'd expect the ToC to take me to different parts of that page. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, the hyperlinks in the rendered page take the text directly. e.g.:\r\nIf I click on [1.2.3 Forecasters that can make use of exogeneous data], the link is (https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/examples/01_forecasting.html#section_1_2_3) - but the correct link here (for the page itself) would be [this](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/examples/01_forecasting.html#1.2.3-Forecasters-that-can-make-use-of-exogeneous-data)\r\n\r\nI found one possible solution [here](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_ipython_internal_links.html#one-more-piece-of-advice), but it's a bit manual. Either that, or just don't bother with the html tag approach - it'll work in both I think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1236808731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmerrittsmith","id":12184066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg0MDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12184066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/tmerrittsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmerrittsmith/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7321716504,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5GIUZpzwAAAAG0aIcY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7321716504","actor":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-05T10:14:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7321716509,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5GIUZpzwAAAAG0aIcd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7321716509","actor":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-05T10:14:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
