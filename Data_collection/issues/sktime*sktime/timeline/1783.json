[docs/source/installation.rst](docs/source/installation.rst)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather substantial effort involving changes to how `sktime` is build and distributed. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n-  Add [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) (see [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) and [PEP 633](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0633/)]. The intention behind is to collect all package matadata and dependencies in one place.\r\n- Add sets of optional dependencies:\r\n    - `all_extras` all \"soft\" dependencies\r\n    - `dev` packages useful for development and testing\r\n    - `binder` packages required for binder and running notebook examples\r\n    - `docs` packages required to build the documentation\r\n- Add section to build time dependencies.\r\n- Refactor existing CI/CD pipelines to use the new build configuration.\r\n- Introduced a new CI/CD pipelines for running tests across win, mac, linux and py37, py38, py39 with github actions.\r\n- Removed the obsolete requirements files.\r\n- Include wheels build for macosx on arm64.\r\n\r\n**Removed**\r\n\r\n- ❌ Drop support for python3.6\r\n- ❌ Drop appveyor and azure pipelines\r\n\r\n**High level diagram for the CI/CD workflows**\r\n\r\n![sktime-cicd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989838/149678967-309054eb-e91e-4988-a6cf-321de0108eb8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nIt does not introduce any new runtime/install dependencies but it could introduce an optional development depencency/build system such as [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to simplify development/build/distribution.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changed to the CI/CD pipelines that would hopefully allow to drop ``appveyor`` and ``azure pipelines`` in favor of ``github actions`` which would simplify the current build and maintenance process.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-22T15:28:08Z","updated_at":"2021-12-22T15:28:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1793","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1793/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1793/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1793/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/1793","id":1086939050,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc4wMLiz","number":1793,"title":"Correct

See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged.

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCorrect the method name call that was causing an error.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
