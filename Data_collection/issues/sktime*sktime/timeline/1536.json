the bug**\r\nFollowing the tutorials for univariate time series classification, encountered a TypeError bug when running the code found in the section on [time series forests](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/examples/02_classification_univariate.html#Time-series-forest).\r\n\r\nTypeError is thrown when instantiating the ComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier class as per the example code.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.summarize import RandomIntervalFeatureExtractor\r\n\r\nsteps = [\r\n    (\r\n        \"extract\",\r\n        RandomIntervalFeatureExtractor(n_intervals=\"sqrt\", features=[np.mean, np.std, _slope])\r\n    ),\r\n    (\"clf\", DecisionTreeClassifier())\r\n]\r\n\r\ntime_series_tree = Pipeline(steps)\r\n\r\n# Fit and evaluate single time series tree\r\ntime_series_tree.fit(x_train, y_train)\r\ntime_series_tree.score(x_test, `y_test)`\r\n\r\ntsf = ComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier( # This is where the TypeError is thrown\r\n    estimator=time_series_tree,\r\n    n_estimators=100,\r\n    criterion=\"entropy\",\r\n    bootstrap=True,\r\n    oob_score=True,\r\n    random_state=1,\r\n    n_jobs=-1\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Fit and obtain oob score\r\ntsf.fit(x_train, y_train)\r\n\r\nif tsf.oob_score:\r\n    print(tsf.oob_score_)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier should be instantiable\r\nOR \r\nTutorial should be changed to show correct methodology for using time series forests.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI believe the issue might be related to __init__ being marked as an abstract method

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nFixed a bug preventing usage of ComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nAn abstract method in sklearn called _set_oob_score_and_attributes was implemented to allow instantiation of ComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier objects, but with just `pass` in the body of the method. This might need to be implemented properly in the future, but isn't currently used.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are.

contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
