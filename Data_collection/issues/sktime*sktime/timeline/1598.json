is a draft PR with a skeleton base class in accordance with the proposed refactor in STEP 11 here: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/11_transformer_refactor/step.md\r\nFunctionality/logic is still missing, but this is for discussing the class design.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n* nested `_fit`/`fit` logic as in forecasting and classification\r\n* there is now just one base class; behaviour is controlled by the tags which indicate what input is converted in what output\r\n* all transformers functions now accept series and panels; for instance, if it's a series-to-sth transformer, the panel instances are looped over. If it's a panel-to-sth transformer, a series is interpreted as a one-instance-panel.\r\n* to enable this, the arguments need to change to be the same - `Z` will be deprecated in favour of `X` which anyway seems to be the key user expectation here; currently an input handler ensures that `Z` is treated as an alias for `X` in general\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains a first stab at:\r\n* checking and conversion logic\r\n* logic related to the panel/series treatment in one, single interface\r\n\r\nAs an example, I've also moved `BoxCoxTransformer` to the new interface:\r\n* all that had to be done was changing `fit` to `_fit` etc, and populate the `X_inner_mtype` tag correctly\r\n* due to the panel/series logic, this now also works out-of-the box for all the supported panel mtypes including `df-multiindex` which is used for hierarchical time series as well\r\n\r\nReviewers should focus on:\r\n* the new transformers base class in `base.py`, especially the input handling logic\r\n* the refactored `BoxCoxTransformer`, an example how a `SeriesToSeriesTransformer` looks after the refactor\r\n* the refactored `SignatureTransformer`, an example how a `PanelToTabularTransformer` looks after the refactor\r\n\r\nMinor changes needed to make the refactor work:\r\n* conversion functionality from `Series` to `Panel` (one-instance) in `datatypes._series_as_panel`\r\n* conversion from `Panel` mtype `nested_univ` from and to `df-list` (in `datatypes._panel._convert`), since the former is used a lot in tests\r\n* added check in `check_is` for `pd.Dataframe` mtype for `Series` scitype for columns not of `object` dtype, since current check could not distinguish that and the `Panel` mtype `nested_univ` (both were `pd.DataFrame` type)\r\n* PR #1368, which fixes an issue with `TrendForecaster` where it breaks if an `X` is passed. I've made a separate PR since it's a bug that's not related to transformers, just prevents proper fixing of another bug in the current transformer interface.\r\n* `fit_transform` is changed to `fit(X, y).transform(X, y)` from `fit(X, y).transform(X)` which I think was an oversight. Since many tests use `TrendForecaster`, the above change #1368 has to be done first.\r\n* changes to the signature transformers to address the interface inconsistency reported in #1369\r\n* relaxing `np.ndarray` mtype for `Series` so 1D numpy arrays are also allowed (and considered univariate series or vector). This is required since some tests use univariate numpy arrays as label vectors.\r\n* `ForecastingPipeline` was accidentally referring to `y` as `X` in one instance, this was
