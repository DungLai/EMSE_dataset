, thank you for the reply. I think make_reduction is the one I am looking for. Another question is that I am trying to use lightgbm with sktime to predict a few days ahead with multiple features (include categorical features). Lightgbm in scikit-learn package can deal with categorical features directly as string format in 'fit' function without the need of encoding first. Since sktime is using scikit-learn's lightgbm, but seems that this function is not supported. If I understand correctly, based on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/compose/_reduce.py, it stacks the X, y data together and assign it to a initialized numpy ndarray first, and then fit to model. But 'string' can not be saved into numpy array, hence it caused the problem. I also didn't find tutorial on how to predict n-days ahead for multivariate data including categorical feature on the documentation. Since it is a very common scenario in reality, I am wondering is it supported so far and it is still underdevelopment?
