PR partially resolves #1364 and #2088, it enables `MultiplexForecaster` to work with multivariate, hierarchical, and/or probabilistic forecasters.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by replacing manual loopthrough with:\r\n\r\n* tag cloning\r\n* delegation via the general `_DelegatedForecaster` (which includes the probabilistic methods and will also pick up any future method that is added)\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains:\r\n* docstring improvements in the `_HeterogeneousMetaEstimator`\r\n* a docstring fix, added missing default value for parameter `deep` in `get_params` throughout the code base\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on:\r\n* refactor and fixes to `update_predict` in
