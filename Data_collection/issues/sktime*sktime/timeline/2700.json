It looks like you found out why we have problems with `test_update_predict_predicted_index` repeatedly.\r\nWell, this is the third reason, I think I removed two other reasons here https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2555 and here https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2466 ...\r\n\r\nThis test is cursed.\r\n\r\nI think there are two topics here: a design question, and pragmatic next steps.\r\n\r\nRegarding pragmatic next steps: I think your PR is perfectly appropriate as a fix, until we have answered the design questions. Since it moves intention and logic back to the case `sktime` supports and which is widely tested, that of regular time stamp indices (I intentionally don't say \"continuous\" since this term has multiple, reserved meanings).\r\n\r\nRegarding design questions: having read this three times, I am not sure whether this is:\r\n\r\n* a problem with the test logic, e.g., we do not need/want to test that esimators are fine with irregular data\r\n* a problem with the test implementation, i.e., whether the intention was to have what you changed it to\r\n* a problem with the framework, i.e., that it does not mitigate the impact when data becomes irregular like this\r\n\r\nThis seems to boil down to some design questions related to irregular data:\r\n\r\n* should all forecaster estimators be fine with irregular data? E.g., if received in `update` like this.\r\n* if forecasters are not fine with irregular data, but receive a time stamp \"on the grid\", should the \"updating memory\" functionality of the framework perhaps fill in NAs? Then, forecasters which can deal with NAs but not irregular data would still be ok. We have an encapsulated entry point for the memory update since this PR https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2412, so this could be addressed there.\r\n* if some forecasters can deal with irregular data while others cannot, should we introduce a tag for it, and have conditional behaviour and testing?\r\n\r\nFrom answers to the above, we can derive:\r\n\r\n* framework implementation and logic implementation targets\r\n* an answer to \"what the `test_update_predict_predicted_index` test should do\r\n* whether we need additional tests related to irregular data","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1138230393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1138230968","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2700#issuecomment-1138230968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2700","id":1138230968,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5D2Aa4","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-26T07:04:37Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T07:04:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I
