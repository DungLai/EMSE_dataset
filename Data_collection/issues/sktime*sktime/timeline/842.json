guys!\r\nFYI, I was also trying to run HIVE-COTE v1 today. I got confronted with the following error. Any help is appreciated if that is a known bug and/or I make something wrong here. My data is of shape `X_train.shape = (N_samples, 1, time_bins)` and `y_train.shape = (N_samples,)` with `y_train = [0, 1]`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-18-815c2880dcd0> in <module>\r\n----> 1 hc.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/py38/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sktime/classification/hybrid/_hivecote_v1.py in fit(self, X, y)\r\n    101             time_contract_in_mins=60,\r\n    102         )\r\n--> 103         self.stc.fit(X, y)\r\n    104         train_preds = cross_val_predict(\r\n    105             ShapeletTransformClassifier(\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/py38/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sktime/classification/shapelet_based/_stc.py in fit(self, X, y)\r\n    119         self.classes_ = class_distribution(np.asarray(y).reshape(-1, 1))[0][0]\r\n    120 \r\n--> 121         self.classifier_.fit(X, y)\r\n    122 \r\n    123         self._is_fitted = True\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/py38/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sklearn/pipeline.py in fit(self, X, y, **fit_params)\r\n    328         \"\"\"\r\n    329         fit_params_steps = self._check_fit_params(**fit_params)\r\n--> 330         Xt = self._fit(X, y, **fit_params_steps)\r\n    331         with _print_elapsed_time('Pipeline',\r\n    332                                  self._log_message(len(self.steps) - 1)):\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/py38/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sklearn/pipeline.py in _fit(self, X, y, **fit_params_steps)\r\n    294                 message_clsname='Pipeline',\r\n    295                 message=self._log_message(step_idx),\r\n--> 296                 **fit_params_steps[name])\r\n    297             # Replace the transformer of the step with the fitted\r\n    298             # transformer.
