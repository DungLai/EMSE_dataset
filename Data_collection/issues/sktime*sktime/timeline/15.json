So the one can store images/series/... and anything else in homogeneous style inside a \"data frame\". It makes sense to use use the exact dtype, not abstract object because it reduces the potential error user might make. For example, user can randomly put a series inside an image column -> transformer will fail on that cell -> it's hard to find that kind of errors.\r\nI think it sounds legit, what do you think?\"\r\n\r\nSounds similar to my point above?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/459438382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/459503730","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/15#issuecomment-459503730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/15","id":459503730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTUwMzczMA==","user":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-31T20:57:59Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T21:12:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So this is my 2p's worth. Bare in mind I am not a python or R programmer of any experience. \r\n1. I believe xpandas extends pandas. Therefore, until we run into a scenario where xpandas functionality is required, algorithm development should I feel continue with pandas. Simplest solution being the best and all. There is nothing lost, and if we want to enforce xpanda input it will be very easy to update it later.\r\n2. python is a weakly typed language, and has no equivalent to generics in java or templates in c++ to restrict typing afaik. You are trying to enforce the characteristic loved in typed languages on a language that actively discourages type safety of any sensible kind (from a Java perspective). I think this may be confusing for people who like weakly typed languages (I'm using empathy here, I have no idea how such people think, except that they like ducks). \r\n3. My preference would be to enforce type safety through data loading routines, e.g. load timeSeries or somesuch would throw exceptions if images or ducks were attempted to be loaded via a method meant for loading time series\r\n4. I think classifiers/regressors should check whether they have the capabilities to handle the type of data  given to them, throwing exceptions if they cannot. \r\n\r\nto summarise, my preference would be to proceed with pandas until we have the vanilla/univariate TSC algorithms at a decent stage, then reassess. This will give us a suite of classifiers that are completely scikit-learn compatible, which we can then enhance with specialisations able to handle special cases such as multivariate/unequal length. Similarly with forecasting and regressors. From the algorithm development side, it is not that big a deal switching, and delaying the implementation side of things will hold up the project.

I'm leaning towards extending pandas when we have done the minibake off, primarily for storing metadata such as contains missing, unequal length etc. Otherwise we rely on the classifier to check this, which seems a little wasteful, brittle and poorly encapsulated, these are properties of the data not the classifier. I dont think we necessarily need to use XPandas to do this, we could just write a stripped down extension ourselves, but obvs things will be different in forecasting world.
