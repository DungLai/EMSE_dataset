out item from https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2243.\r\n\r\nExtends `evaluate` to accept hierarchical `X` and `y`.\r\n\r\nBy extension, should enable `GridSearchCV` to handle hierarchical data and resolve bug https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3464.\r\n\r\nLess hacky version of https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3509 which uses the centralized checker functions and hierarchical functionality of splitters instead of custom duplicates.\r\n\r\nFYI @aiwalter, @danbartl,
