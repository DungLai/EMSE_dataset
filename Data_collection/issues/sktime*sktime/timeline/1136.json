your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nEnsembleForecaster does not currently accept weights. With #1136  and #1139 being worked on it would be nice to optionally allow users to pass weights to `EnsembleForecaster`. \r\n\r\nThis would give users an out-of-the-box way to use ainverse error based weighting strategy in forecasting ensembles. Users could also supply other types of weights (information criterion, etc).  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn update to the `EnsembleForecaster` API to allow weights to be passed (number weights should equal number of forecasters passed). \r\n\r\nThis would require altering the `__init__` to store the weights, adding a check (in `_fit`?), and then updating `_predict` to use versions of the `aggfunc` that allow weights (for examples of this see use of _weighted_percentile, _weighted_geometric_mean, and np.average in performance_metrics\\_functions.py).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1162/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/895337603","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1136#issuecomment-895337603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1136","id":895337603,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc41XcSD","user":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-09T15:52:28Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T15:52:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"closed by #1139 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/895337603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5130593234,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTEzMDU5MzIzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5130593234","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-09T15:52:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
