have diagnosed where the error is coming from but I am unsure how to fix it. An X matrix is generated by `_sliding_window_transform`, this has 3 dimensions and is then passed to `fit` in the regressor, the regressor then rejects the X matrix as it has 3 dimensions. A naive fix is to do `X.squeeze()` to get rid of the extra dimension but this may break other functionality. Doing this does get the forecaster to fit successfully (though it raises an error as it has no summary attribute).\r\n\r\nMore details\r\nThe fitting process goes through the `RecursiveReducer` class which goes through a step `yt, Xt = self._transform(y, X)`. Prior to this X is `None`. The transform takes it to the `_sliding_window_transform` which generated this 3 dimensional matrix. After this step the estimator (the gbm regressor) is fitted on `(yt, Xt)` and the error occurs as `Xt` has 3 dimensions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1110871122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eenticott-shell","id":93924843,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZkt6w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93924843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell","html_url":"https://github.com/eenticott-shell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1117996947","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2117#issuecomment-1117996947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2117","id":1117996947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Co0eT","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T22:36:39Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T22:36:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@eenticott-shell, it looks like the wrong recursive reducer is used.\r\n\r\nThere is one for *time series regressors* which I think produces 3D data to pass to an `sktime` time series regressor, the `RecursiveTimeSeriesRegressionForecaster`.
