The tasks this PR seeks to realize are:\r\n\r\n1. provide users the ability to set initial_window to 0 _and have it actually be set to 0_\r\n2. displays a new `FutureWarning` message prompted when the user sets the default for `start_with_window` to be `False` instead of the default value which is `True`. This way we can warn our users about the coming change and allow them time to make the necessary changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-28T15:41:01Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T15:41:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3651","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3651/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3651/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3651/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3651","id":1424305676,"node_id":"I_kwDOCVKAsc5U5S4M","number":3651,"title":"[ENH]
