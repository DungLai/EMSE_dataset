@mloning!\r\n\r\nI’ve got the same error using a transformer created by `make_row_transformer(Imputer())`. The input data was a nested DataFrame containing series of variable length. Is it the currently expected behavior in this case? \r\n\r\nAs the transformer created by this function operates independently on each row, I thought it would work. Why is it needed to force the series to have the same length?\r\n\r\nFrom the top of my head, I would say that it is due to efficiency purposes (operations over the axis=1 of numpy arrays). But, in this case, you could check if the lengths match. If they do, coerce to numpy. Otherwise, proceed to process each series independently.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense?\r\n\r\nThanks for the great work you’ve been

is a known problem, @pedropalb, so we've decided to get rid of `make_row_transformer` and have transformers cast/apply automatically per series if a `Panel` object like a nested dataframe is passed.\r\n\r\nThat is, the current refactor of transformers should allow the `Imputer` to be *directly* applied to any `Panel` format (including nested data frames) and not require equal length, without applying the `make_row_transformer`.\r\n\r\nYou may have to wait for https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1795 to merge, but you can try it out on your use case by checking out the PR to see whether it works.
