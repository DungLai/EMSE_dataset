Reference Issues/PRs\r\nIssue #1214 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAutomatically finding best weights for ensemble based on a meta-model (regressor). Weights are taken from\r\neither `regressor.coef_` for all `sklearn` linear models or from `regressor.feature_importances_` for all decision tree-based models.\r\n\r\nI already proved in an example that `AutoEnsembleForecaster` is outperforming each single given forecaster for `load_airline` data, so we know that this ensemble approach can outperform.

contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
