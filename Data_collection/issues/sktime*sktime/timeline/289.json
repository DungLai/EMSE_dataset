Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nPR fixes issue number #284.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe algorithm that I have implemented here is ShapeDTW which is similar to ordinary DTW except that instead of performing DTW on the original time series, you transform it into a list of arrays or shapelets. DTW is then performed on these list of arrays. This algorithm involved implementing several new transformers - SlidingWindowSegmenter, DerivativeTransformer, DWTTransformer and more. This algorithm did require writing a helper function in TimeSeriesNeighbours so that this module is compatible with multivariate classification (the distance metrics are compatable but the original TimeSeriesNeighbours is not). \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n\r\nNot anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\n\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n \r\n- [ ] I have updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my algorithm works.\r\n   \r\n- [x] I have updated sktime's \r\n[estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm\r\n committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### Any other

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a workaround for check_array that is not wrapped with a decorator.\r\nChange the _check_array_ts to accept any other not used arguments and keyword arguments.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo test added but it passes all test before.
