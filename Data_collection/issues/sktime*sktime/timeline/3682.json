Obviously any predictions made on the disaggregate models would have to be aggregated together in order to compare performances with the most aggregate model.

I hope to try and tackle feature 1 soon then.\r\n\r\n> That sounds like pears and apples. Would that relate to this feature? Or is it a separate question?\r\n\r\nIt starts off being pears and apples but the core advantage of feature 2 is to let you transform these comparison to apples and apples. In effect, it allows the user to treat the temporal granularity of the time series model as a hyperparameter. For example, say you have 2 models:\r\n\r\n- Model A is trained on monthly aggregations of the forecast variable\r\n- Model B is trained on weekly aggregations of the forecast variable\r\n\r\nI would like the cross-validation scores of Model B to be on the same scale as that of Model A so I can easily compare them. Clearly the only way to do this is to transform the weekly forecasts of Model B to monthly forecasts by aggregating the appropriate weekly forecasts together for each month. You do the same aggregation of weekly data to monthly for the actuals. And now you can assess Model B's performance as if it was making monthly predictions. Now you can compare Model B's performance with that of Model A's because the metrics are on the same scale of monthly.\r\n\r\nSo it relates in that feature 2 is a requirement to being able to treat the level of temporal aggregation as a hyperparameter. I'm just not sure if the solution I proposed by using a custom scoring method is the most appropriate. Whatever the solution, I think it would be something nice to be able to do in sktime as exploring different temporal aggregations is something that pops up in the literature from time to time.
