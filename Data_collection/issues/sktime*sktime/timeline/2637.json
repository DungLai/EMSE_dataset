pycaret version checks\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported [here](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues).\n\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/releases) of pycaret.\n\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the develop branch of pycaret (pip install -U git+https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret.git@develop).\n\n\n### Issue Description\n\nI tried an example with a custom pipeline and it works if done manually, but not when done in pycaret (classification). Reproducible example here: https://gist.github.com/ngupta23/0e73daeb409ae35e048baed49f32c096\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport tsfresh\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\r\n\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_arrow_head\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.tsfresh import TSFreshFeatureExtractor\r\n\r\n# Load all arrow head\r\narrow_X, arrow_y = load_arrow_head(return_type=\"numpy2d\")\r\narrow_X = pd.DataFrame(arrow_X)\r\narrow_y = pd.DataFrame({\"target\": arrow_y})\r\narrow = pd.concat([arrow_X, arrow_y], axis=1)\r\n\r\n## Custom Pipeline (Manual without Pycaret - Works!)\r\n\r\ntsfresh = TSFreshFeatureExtractor(default_fc_parameters=\"minimal\")\r\nrandf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\r\npipe = Pipeline(\r\n    [\r\n        (\"transform\", tsfresh),\r\n        (\"classifier\", randf),\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\npipe.fit(arrow_X.values, arrow_y.values)\r\n\r\n## Custom Pipeline with Pycaret (Does not work)\r\n\r\nfrom pycaret.classification import ClassificationExperiment\r\ntsfresh = TSFreshFeatureExtractor(default_fc_parameters=\"minimal\")\r\ncustom_tx = (\"transform\", tsfresh)\r\nexp = ClassificationExperiment()\r\nexp.setup(data = arrow, target=\"target\", custom_pipeline=custom_tx)\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`pycaret` should work with the custom pipeline step as it works manually.\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```python-traceback\nFeature Extraction: 100%|██████████| 251/251 [00:00<00:00,
