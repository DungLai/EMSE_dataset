Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nFixes [#3830](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3830)\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nStatsmodels with exogenous features would raise an exception in `predict` if `X` contained more indices than the range of `fh`.\r\nThis was due to all indices being passed through to `statsmodels` `predict`.  The fix ensures that only the expected `X` indices from the test set are passed to `statsmodels` `predict`.\r\n\r\nFixes #3830 as this was also the root cause of the exception raised when using `evaluate` with `statsmodels` based estimators.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

the bug**\r\n\r\nmodel_evaluation.evaluate creates X_test containing both train and test samples.  For statsmodels models with exogenous features X_test length must equal the forecast horizon and therefore this currently throws the error:\r\n\r\n`ValueError: Provided exogenous values are not of the appropriate shape.`\r\n\r\nThis bug occurs for UnobservedComponents and SARIMAX.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the bug is in the `_split` function:\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/a5f824a5fff1c3fc1babd3f34b94c5055ec040b0/sktime/forecasting/model_evaluation/_functions.py#L60\r\n\r\nThis could be modified to 'X.iloc[test].sort_index()' for statsmodels models with exogenous features or alternatively by filtering X
