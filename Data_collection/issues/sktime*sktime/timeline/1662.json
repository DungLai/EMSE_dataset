Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather substantial effort involving changes to how `sktime` is build and distributed. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n-  Add [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) (see [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) and [PEP 633](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0633/)]. The intention behind is to collect all package matadata and dependencies in one place.\r\n- Add sets of optional dependencies:\r\n    - `all_extras` all \"soft\" dependencies\r\n    - `dev` packages useful for development and testing\r\n    - `binder` packages required for binder and running notebook examples\r\n    - `docs` packages required to build the documentation\r\n- Add section to build time dependencies.\r\n- Refactor existing CI/CD pipelines to use the new build configuration.\r\n- Introduced a new CI/CD pipelines for running tests across win, mac, linux and py37, py38, py39 with github actions.\r\n- Removed the obsolete requirements files.\r\n- Include wheels build for macosx on arm64.\r\n\r\n**Removed**\r\n\r\n- ❌ Drop support for python3.6\r\n- ❌ Drop appveyor and azure pipelines\r\n\r\n**High level diagram for the CI/CD workflows**\r\n\r\n![sktime-cicd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989838/149678967-309054eb-e91e-4988-a6cf-321de0108eb8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nIt does not introduce any new runtime/install dependencies but it could introduce an optional development depencency/build system such as [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to simplify development/build/distribution.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changed to the CI/CD pipelines that would hopefully allow to drop ``appveyor`` and ``azure pipelines`` in favor of ``github actions`` which would simplify the current build and maintenance process.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/981449561","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1662#issuecomment-981449561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1662","id":981449561,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc46f7tZ","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-29T09:30:37Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T09:30:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I think the bug is straightforward, just looking at it (needs to be confirmed).\r\n\r\n`FeatureUnion` has a `transformer` attribute which contains the components.

That's the same with `sklearn` pipeline or grid search, which results in an object that behaves just like your normal supervised learner or transformer.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the more subtle points in AI

being fixed in #1695 but this is *not merged yet* so the same problem could happen again.\r\n\r\nThe fix in thie PR replaces inheritance in `FeatureUnion` by the wrapper pattern.\r\n\r\nThat fixes the bug #1662, since it was caused by `FeatureUnion` having side effects on constructor arguments which were expected to remain unchanged. The side effects were coming from the package external parent class, so the only simple way to avoid this seems to wrap it and clone the arguments before passing them.\r\n\r\nThe original arguments don't get changed, since the side effects apply to the cloned versions

attempted fix for #1662 which PR #1665 did not fix.\r\nThat #1665 did not fix #1662 was not detected due to faulty remote CI and, I guess, @TonyBagnall not checking locally.\r\n#1700 fixed the `fit_idempotent` test but introduced other test failures.\r\n\r\nNote: the remote CI fault is being fixed in #1695 but this is *not merged yet* so the same problem could happen again.\r\n\r\nThe fix in thie PR leaves the inheritance pattern, but renames the argument `transformer_list` to `transformers` and puts cloning between the two )clones `transformers` to `transformer_list`). Since the inherited methods look for `transformer_list` in the object, this fix does not work with the original argument name.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/991955841","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1662#issuecomment-991955841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1662","id":991955841,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc47IAuB","user":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-12T19:24:36Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T19:24:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"It seems this should be reopened since the test is not passing still, see https://github.com/lmmentel/sktime/runs/4498946788?check_suite_focus=true As you can see it's failing for all linux host and for macOS with py37.\r\n\r\nI've tried some additional ideas but so far I'm not able to make it work.
