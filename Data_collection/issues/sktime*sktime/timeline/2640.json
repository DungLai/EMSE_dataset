(@fkiraly's summary of discussion, point 14-10-2022):\r\n\r\nsee discussion below. The reported behaviour is not a bug, but a frustrated user expectation.\r\n\r\nThis stems from how 2D numpy arrays are interpreted in `sktime` transformers and forecasters, an (m, n) array is interpreted as a single time series with m time points and n variables - let's call this convention A.\r\n\r\n@patrickzib and @TonyBagnall think this is an unnatural way to interpret 2D numpy arrays, and would rather like an (m, n) array to be interpreted as m univariate time series of equal length (number time stamps) n - let's call this convention B.\r\n\r\nThis opinion agrees with the way in which @haskarb's user expectation was frustrated.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2640\r\nrelation is: classifier interpret 2D numpy arrays as per convention B. Everywhere else, convention A is applied.\r\nIssue #2640 is about the convention clash between classifiers and everywhere else.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI'm performing MiniRocket tranformation on a small dataset.
