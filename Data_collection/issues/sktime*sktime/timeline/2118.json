is an alternative approach to the `get_time_index` issue #2044.\r\n\r\nInstead of a function that gets the entire time index - which is ambiguous for `Panel` data since different instances may have different index sets - this PR adds a function `get_cutoff` which returns the latest time index observed in the data.\r\n\r\nThe index is returned as a length 1 `pd.Index`, which can be indexed to get the value.\r\nThe function `get_cutoff` also allows to input an existing `cutoff` which shifts the `cutoff` in case a `np.ndarray` format is input.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds replaces the logic of `_set_cutoff_from_y` in `BaseForecaster` with `get_cutoff`, which is hence upgraded to `Panel` and `Hierarchical` data container types.\r\n\r\nFYI @danbartl, does this work for you?\r\n\r\nUpdate: the original approach is failing tests since somewhere, length zero series `y` are generated as args to `fit` or `update`. I don't understand why this happens, and feel it should probably not. Raised a bug report https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2118. For now, it's treated as \"no update to `cutoff` happens if length zero `y` is

#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n#1687 \r\n\r\n> #### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\n@fkiraly \r\nAs part of the probabilistic forecasting API, this will implement the `_predict_var` method to forecasters\r\n\r\n> #### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nSTEP [probabilistic forecasting API](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/13_proba_forecasting/step.md)\r\n\r\n> #### PR checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] add `_predict_var` and its corresponding tag to the forecasting extension template.\r\n- [x] add `NaiveVariance` composite class which implements the 'simple strategy' for variance prediction.\r\n- [x] implement `_predict_var` and its corresponding in `NaiveVariance`.\r\n- [x] implement `_predict_quantiles` in `NaiveVariance` where quantiles are inferred from a normal distribution. \r\n- [x] implement covariance prediction (`cov=True`)\r\n\r\n> ##### For all contributions\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1865/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1072247183","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2118#issuecomment-1072247183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2118","id":1072247183,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc4_6TGP","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-18T09:49:44Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T09:49:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@IlyasMoutawwakil,
