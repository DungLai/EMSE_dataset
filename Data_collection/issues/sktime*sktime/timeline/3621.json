Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nFixes #3621. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems why `EnsembleForecaster` failed when ensembling multivariate forecasting models:\r\n\r\n1. The tags were set to `\"scitype:y\": \"univariate\"` which meant that only series were passed to the underlying ensembling models.\r\n    * This was changed to `\"scitype:y\": \"both\"`\r\n2. The method in which aggregated the predictions assumed that the model predictions are univariate.\r\n    * This was also changed\r\n    \r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nOn the `_predict` method of the `EnsembleForecaster`. This is where the major changes took place.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.
