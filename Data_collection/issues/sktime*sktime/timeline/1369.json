is a draft PR with a skeleton base class in accordance with the proposed refactor in STEP 11 here: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/11_transformer_refactor/step.md\r\nFunctionality/logic is still missing, but this is for discussing the class design.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n* nested `_fit`/`fit` logic as in forecasting and classification\r\n* there is now just one base class; behaviour is controlled by the tags which indicate what input is converted in what output\r\n* all transformers functions now accept series and panels; for instance, if it's a series-to-sth transformer, the panel instances are looped over. If it's a panel-to-sth transformer, a series is interpreted as a one-instance-panel.\r\n* to enable this, the arguments need to change to be the same - `Z` will be deprecated in favour of `X` which anyway seems to be the key user expectation here; currently an input handler ensures that `Z` is treated as an alias for `X` in general\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains a first stab at:\r\n* checking and conversion logic\r\n* logic related to the panel/series treatment in one, single interface\r\n\r\nAs an example, I've also moved `BoxCoxTransformer` to the new interface:\r\n* all that had to be done was changing `fit` to `_fit` etc, and populate the `X_inner_mtype` tag correctly\r\n* due to the panel/series logic, this now also works out-of-the box for all the supported panel mtypes including `df-multiindex` which is used for hierarchical time series as well\r\n\r\nReviewers should focus on:\r\n* the new transformers base class in `base.py`, especially the input handling logic\r\n* the refactored `BoxCoxTransformer`, an example how a `SeriesToSeriesTransformer` looks after the refactor\r\n* the refactored `SignatureTransformer`, an example how a `PanelToTabularTransformer` looks after the refactor\r\n\r\nMinor changes needed to make the refactor work:\r\n* conversion functionality from `Series` to `Panel` (one-instance) in `datatypes._series_as_panel`\r\n* conversion from `Panel` mtype `nested_univ` from and to `df-list` (in `datatypes._panel._convert`), since the former is used a lot in tests\r\n* added check in `check_is` for `pd.Dataframe` mtype for `Series` scitype for columns not of `object` dtype, since current check could not distinguish that and the `Panel` mtype `nested_univ` (both were `pd.DataFrame` type)\r\n* PR #1368, which fixes an issue with `TrendForecaster` where it breaks if an `X` is passed. I've made a separate PR since it's a bug that's not related to transformers, just prevents proper fixing of another bug in the current transformer interface.\r\n* `fit_transform` is changed to `fit(X, y).transform(X, y)` from `fit(X, y).transform(X)` which I think was an oversight. Since many tests use `TrendForecaster`, the above change #1368 has to be done first.\r\n* changes to the signature transformers to address the interface inconsistency reported in #1369\r\n* relaxing `np.ndarray` mtype for `Series` so 1D numpy arrays are also allowed (and considered univariate series or vector). This is required since some tests use univariate numpy arrays as label vectors.\r\n* `ForecastingPipeline` was accidentally referring to `y` as `X` in one instance, this was fixed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1365/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/910046821","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1369#issuecomment-910046821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1369","id":910046821,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc42PjZl","user":{"login":"jambo6","id":32545677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTQ1Njc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32545677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6","html_url":"https://github.com/jambo6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jambo6/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T08:10:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T08:10:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I'm used to writing (data, labels) rather than (X, y) and evidently, I missed this. \r\n\r\nAre my tests supposed to have picked this up, or existing sktime tests?
