this. Road testing a number of classifiers that use the catch22 transform, they use a lot of memory even on relatively small datasets. Just calling the catch22 method from the C wrapper we use without storing anything rapidly increases memory used. Most likely a memory leak in the wrapper itself. Best option IMO would be to reimplement the catch22 features in Python for sktime using numba or something.\r\n\r\nI may do this myself at some point, but if anyone else would like to take it on I can lend a hand. There are implementations in C and Matlab by the author, and a Java implementation by myself to draw from if
