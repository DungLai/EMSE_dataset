@aiwalter I had one more follow up question. I could see that TBATS was taking about 14 seconds for fitting a model to a time series of length 24 datapoints, this is consistent with both the source TBATS and the sktime wrapper around TBATS. 14 seconds to fit a model for one time series seems a bit too long (compared to the R implementation). Let me know if there's anything we can do to improve the runtime. Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nP.S : I'm using a Windows 10 machine, using all my 8 cores to fit the model.
