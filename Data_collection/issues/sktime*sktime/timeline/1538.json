for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n #1538 #1547 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr takes all the current distance metrics in sktime and converts them to numba. The distances can be used in the exact same way they were before (params are consistent). Furthermore, a multitude of bugs/errors were found and fixed.\r\n\r\nIn addition there are 3 new features that come along with this. The first is pairwise distance. This allows you to perform a distance computation across a dataset of timeseries or between two timeseries with massive performance gains.\r\n\r\nThe second (a much demanded request) both distance and pairwise distance now support 1d and 2d arrays.\r\n\r\nThe third new feature is the ability to create a numba compiled function for your specific use case via a factory method. This then allows you to embed your created function directly into another numba function  (you can't call non numba compiled functions from inside another numba meaning you have to exit effectivly removing any potential performance gains). This will allow for many other modules to more easily be converted to numba (i.e. classification and clustering) and find massive performance gains.\r\n\r\nFinally there were no docstrings or tests for the previous distances and this pr adds a huge amount of testing and validation and well as docstrings to everything.\r\n\r\nThere is also custom logic to create LowerBounding matrices compatiable with the module.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nThere is a lot stuff here (sorry). Normally i'd split this up but the intention of the pr was to swap the old distances out all at the same time and so we never have to touch cython again. Most of the 'new' stuff is really docstrings and tests that the previous distances were severily lacking (there were no docstrings or tests at all).\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the code there are going to be a couple of things that will appear a 'weird' way of doing something. 90% of the time it's will have something to do with working around a restriction with numba so please ask about anything you see.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1574/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/957833347","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1538#issuecomment-957833347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1538","id":957833347,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc45F2CD","user":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T15:32:40Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T15:32:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"role
