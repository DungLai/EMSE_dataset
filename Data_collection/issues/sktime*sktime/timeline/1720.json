we are testing the user contracts pretty well, but, as far a I see, not the extension contracts.\r\nThat is, we don't test the functionality in the base classes in isolation, only together with concrete implementations.\r\n\r\nThe \"vanilla\" way to test the extension contracts would be to build testing mock concrete classes that sit \"inside\" the base classes and feed back test results.\r\n\r\nFor instance, one could imagine a positive mock whose `_fit` asserts that the arguments passed to it have the right mtype (e.g., `X_inner_mtype`), and which can be set up with different `X_inner_mtype` for testing purposes.\r\nOr, one could imagine a negative mock which fails to adhere to the extension contract, e.g., by having a wrong `_predict` return or a wrong tag, and which tests whether informative error messages are raised.\r\n\r\nWe should:\r\n- [ ] discuss what the test cases should be here - I'd say, at least positive tests on the input/output interfaces of the private methods\r\n- [x] #1720\r\n- [ ] plan and implement for all of
