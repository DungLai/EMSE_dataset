FYI @KishManani, @danbartl.\r\n\r\nCombining information from @danbartl and @KishManani, I understood where the issue must have been coming from - from a line of `np.diff` on the checked index, in `_index_equally_spaced`, but only in the case of `pd.PeriodIndex` (the latter condition I only understood from @KishManani's analysis).\r\n\r\nI have used this insight to replace the time and memory consuming check by a much quicker one, exploiting mathematical assumptions on the `pd.PeriodIndex` (unique and sorted index).\r\n\r\nWhile this PR seems to address the issue, some open questions remain:\r\n\r\n* do we want to test this fix, or in general, checks being fast and not memory intensive? If yes, how? Runtimes can vary even on VM.\r\n* is @danbartl's fix in https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3935 redundant or complementary?
