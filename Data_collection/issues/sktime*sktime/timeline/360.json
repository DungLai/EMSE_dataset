PS: you have to leave some time to find a consensus and call a vote before casting your vote ;-)\r\n\r\nWell, I interpreted this as discussing a concrete proposal for change, rather than \"let's review our GitFlow model, any suggestions?\" - also, was sticking by the voting process we wanted to introduce?\r\n\r\n>\"best practice\" is, many other packages seem to merge directly into master (I've checked SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow).\r\n\r\nIn the original GitFlow model\r\nhttps://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\r\n\r\nit is considered a good idea to separate things:\r\n* consolidation of multiple features - a slightly messy endeavour if multiple people are working on a project\r\n* updating the production release, triggering a build\r\n\r\nIt is also considered good that there is always a branch which only has stable and tested code.\r\n\r\nNow one could consider attachment of a tag as the operation that triggers a build, but in the \"reduced\" model there is no branch were you can be sure that it contains only stable code.\r\n\r\nBased on an assortment of situations in which I was tempted to send emails with subject line \"don't merge while drunk\", I strongly suggest to err on the side of caution here...\r\n\r\n>Not sure what \"best practice\" is, many other packages seem to merge directly into master (I've checked SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow).\r\n\r\nsklearn seems to adopt the master/dev/feature GitFlow models, in the form of a feature/dev/release model?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see:\r\n* vanilla Gitflow dev corresponds to master on sklearn\r\n* vanilla Gitflow master/release is the newest sklearn release branch - e.g., 0.23.0\r\n* feature branches go into sklearn master and live on forks\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't mind master/dev/feature or release/dev/feature, and I'm happy if we call dev master in the second. \r\n\r\nBut either is different from just attaching tags, no?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/667722497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/667727242","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/360#issuecomment-667727242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/360","id":667727242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzcyNzI0Mg==","user":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-02T21:31:49Z","updated_at":"2020-08-02T21:31:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"since

highly inlikely.\r\n\r\n*without* the release branches, you wouldn´t have any \"safe\" branches - that´s why I am ok with master/dev/features, or release/dev/features, but not with
