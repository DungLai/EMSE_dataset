after playing around with `pycaret` a bit, I would suggest we adopt an object oriented interface between the two packages. Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `pycaret` can use `sktime` estimators, but what would be really great if:\r\n\r\n* it can export fitted and \"blueprint\" estimators after the \"easy user workflow\" is run\r\n* it can reference \"stock\" estimators like detrend/deseaslonalize/something which is currently used as a list of defaults\r\n\r\nWhat I would find useful here is work on two things:\r\n\r\n- [ ] the described export functionality\r\n- [ ] a \"contraction\" operation: this is a function `contraction` where you pass a composite estimator, e.g., `Pipeline((\"step1\", Deseasonalize(sp=12)), (\"step2\", ARIMA(p=4, d=3, q=2)))`. The output is a class which behaves like an `sktime` forecaster (or estimator of the same type). Paramters of the contracted composite are mapped onto parameters of the class. In `contract` you can choose which parameters are visible/exposed, and which are not. Defaults are set to the settings of the argument.\r\n\r\nFor instance,\r\n```python\r\ncontraction(\r\n    Pipeline((\"step1\", Deseasonalize(sp=12)), (\"step2\", ARIMA(p=4, d=3, q=2))),\r\n    param_expose = [\"step2__p\", \"step2__d\"]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould give an estimator class which has parameters `sp` and `q`, their defaults being `12` and `2`. The parameters `p` and `d` are not visible in that class, but the internal behaviour has these set to `4` and `3`.\r\n \r\nThis way, you can define your `pycaret` default forecasters as shorthands `PycaretForecaster1`, `PycaretForecaster2` or whatever you like, and plugging them as defaults into the workflow should be much more convenient.\r\n\r\nWith the `sktime` machinery, we can also easily adopt this for `scikit-learn` native estimators, so it would not just be restricted to forecasting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-17T08:47:02Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T08:47:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1147","id":946770974,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NDY3NzA5NzQ=","number":1147,"title":"Good

number of good issues to start working on as a new contributor.\r\nContributions to documentation are especially appreciated.\r\n\r\n### getting started with contributions\r\n\r\n1. Say hello [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sktime-group/shared_invite/zt-62i7aejn-vXc3nOWF26S_P3VXFPWisQ) and get set up for development, see [instructions in the developer guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/developer_guide.html)\r\n2. Pick a “good first issue” to work on, see a collection [in this summary issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1147), or from [this list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue)\r\nsuggestion: pick something small with simple content to learn the “process”\r\n3. Feel free to attend the regular community collab sessions or one of the topic specific stand-ups and tech sessions (see schedule on slack)\r\n4. Once your first PR is merged and you’ve seen how things work, think about your regular time commitment. Optionally, continue attending the Friday community collaboration sessions and stand-ups; or, optionally, [apply for mentoring](https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/README.md)\r\n\r\n### introductory and user testing\r\n\r\n* work through the [sktime tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) and record feedback, you can post it in this issue #1447\r\n* work through user testing sheets for [forecasting](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_forecasting.ipynb) or [time series classification](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_TSC.ipynb), record feedback and send us your user testing sheet with code (e.g., attach to this issue)\r\n* open an issue with a time series related algorithm that you would like to see implemented or interfaced in `sktime`\r\n* work through the [installation instructions](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/installation.html) to install a development version of `sktime`. Record carefully things that are unclear or don't work as described, return the full feedback to us (e.g., in an issue).\r\n\r\n### contributors new to open source\r\n\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing module and class/function docstrings. Pick a file and start adding these. A good starting point are estimator algorithms, these should follow the general documentation style outlined in #1148 or the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). If you start, post the name of the estimator you are working on in #1148; when you open a PR, refer to the issue.\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing examples. Pick a file and start adding these. a good starting point are estimator algorithms, and time series classifiers, see #932 and #1148\r\n\r\nNOTE: #1148 and #932 are closed, but there are still modules without good docstrings. They are just no longer tracked by the issue, which covered the priority items only. So, feel free to go through the code base and help improve docstrings!\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium documentation and technical writing tasks\r\n\r\n* other smaller issues in the [documentation milestone](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/milestone/6)\r\n* the [user guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/user_guide.html) is incomplete. Help is appreciated - the best approach may be converting the [tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) in a well-written guide.\r\n* the [tutorial for time series classification](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) should be re-factored, in the style of the forecasting tutorial\r\n* extension templates for time series regression and time series annotation should be written. The current [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates) can be used as an extension template template.\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium python/coding tasks\r\n\r\n* current open small tasks with a \"recipe\": https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/3429\r\n* pick an unverified bug from the bugfixing board: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/18 and try to reproduce it. Post operating system, python version and (if relevant) package versions, and whether you can yes/no. Investigate further if the bug looks simple - but note that bugs can be anywhere between easy to very difficult to track down.\r\n* Pick an algorithm to implement or interface, according to the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). Possible choices are forecasters (univariate or multivariate), time series classifiers, time series regressors, annotators, distances, kernels - these can be existing feature requests, or new suggestions. We currently do not recommend transformers as they undergo refactoring.\r\n* implement `get_fitted_params` functionality in estimators where this is missing (currently most of them). Related issue for composite estimators: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1497\r\n\r\n### mid to longer term tasks\r\n\r\nFor contributing across a period of weeks or months, consider joining one of the major workstreams and weekly stand-ups on Fridays. Join the slack (see link in README) and say hello on the contributors channel.\r\n\r\nCurrent workstreams, overview here https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects?type=classic:\r\n* forecasting https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/3 and https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/25\r\n* deep learning, benchmarking https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/31\r\n* time series annotation, segmentation, change points https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/27\r\n* pipelines, pywatts integration https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/30\r\n* docs, maintenance, testing https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/26\r\n\r\n### challenging tasks\r\n\r\n✨ Your time to shine! ✨ \r\nTalk to a core dev before starting with these.\r\nAlso have a look at the roadmap #228\r\n\r\n* deep learning interfaces and models, see workstream above\r\n* `get_report` interface for model inspection #971\r\n* refactor/redesign: forecasting interface for stream update/prediction #982\r\n* help build/design new experimental module: distances/kernels\r\n* help build/design new experimental module: annotations (segmentation, change point detection, outlier detection)\r\n* help build/design new experimental module: sequence alignment\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/904645505","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1098#issuecomment-904645505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1098","id":904645505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc4168uB","user":{"login":"Aparna-Sakshi","id":44149689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTQ5Njg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44149689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi","html_url":"https://github.com/Aparna-Sakshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aparna-Sakshi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-24T13:31:29Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T13:31:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@fkiraly I want to work on this issue.

Default parameters would no longer have to be entered in _config but become part of the list of things to implement, in the extension template.\r\n\r\n### Related Issue\r\n#1098 \r\n\r\n### Step\r\n[link for step](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/12_estimator_test_instances/step.md)\r\nThis issue is associated with point 3 of the **suggested refactor sequence** given in the above step.\r\n\r\n### Contributing Guidelines\r\nIf you would like to work on this: please post here and which estimator you are taking on, to avoid duplication of work.\r\nA core dev will then add your name to the estimator under refactoring and/or link the PR.\r\n\r\nA general recipe for refactoring is as follows:\r\n- pick up an estimator class from the below checklist of estimators.\r\n- look for parameters of the estimator in `ESTIMATOR_TEST_PARAMS` (in the tests._config file)\r\n- add `get_test_params` method to the corresponding estimator class which returns a dictionary of the above parameters \r\n- refer to [extension template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates) to add get_test_params to the corresponding estimator class\r\n- For example, in case of `ColumnEnsembleForecaster` , dictionary of parameters which is `{\"forecasters\": FORECASTER} `, should be returned from `get_test_params` method.
