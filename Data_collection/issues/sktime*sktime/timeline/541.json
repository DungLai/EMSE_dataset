Explain your changes.\r\nAllows plot_series to take pred_int (2nd output of model.predict()) as an option variable. If present, plots lower and upper bound confidence intervals for prediction using plt.fill_between. The index of pred_int is also checked to make sure it fits within same axis as existing series. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

\r\n1. We would have to fit multiple models  because most models can only return CIs for a single alpha value. But actually it could work to accept also a list like `alpha = [0.95, 0.9, 0.5]` and loop 3 times over `_fit()` and `predict()`.\r\n2. I think this would change the API because currently `predict()` is returning a `pd.Series` and no `pd.DataFrame`. A better solution could be to return the prediction also when doing `predict(return_pred_int=True)`. Or you can just merge the results of `predict()` and `predict(return_pred_int=True)`? \r\n\r\n@fkiraly thanks for mentioning, I think for now I will rather continue with contributing to `sktime`
