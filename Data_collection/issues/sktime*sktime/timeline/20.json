1. General design.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe design supports a low-level interface which is a direct generalization of sklearn's supervised estimators, and a high-level interface which is more reminiscent of mlr's or openML's task/solution pattern. This allows two user interaction patterns:\r\n\r\nlow-level: data <--> estimator\r\nhigh-level: data <--> task <--> strategy <--> estimator\r\n\r\nThe \"strategy\" class is a visitor to the estimator class. It is similar to the mlaut estimator and visits the scikit-learn-like estimator to provide meta-data, parameter, and task abstraction functionality.\r\n\r\nThe low-level interface should be implemented first; the high-level interface seems necessary for benchmark orchestration.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment/criticize.

on Part 4: Strategy\r\n\r\nThe suggested design is a little bit different from `mlaut_estimator`.  The purpose of the `mlaut_estimator` class was to ensure a common behaviour across the different estimators and a common interface for benchmarking. To achieve this each estimator *inherited* from `mlaut_estimator`. Th\r\n\r\nI think the proposed design is more flexible than `mlaut_estimator`. One comment that I would make is that it seems that if the user wants to implement a new strategy he will need to re-write the entire `strategy` class. Maybe we should think about implementing a *generic strategy* class that a user can inherit from when creating new strategies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/462939053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ViktorKaz","id":33499138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33499138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz","html_url":"https://github.com/ViktorKaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/468343451","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/20#issuecomment-468343451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/20","id":468343451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODM0MzQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T16:39:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T16:39:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Some alternative designs we discussed today with @mloning who likes option 1 (and variations) most.\r\n\r\n\r\nOption 1:\r\nTask = learning metadata, no data, no splits/resampling\r\n\r\nXtrain, Xtest = split(data)\r\nModel.fit(task, Xtrain)\r\nModel.predict(task, Xtest) or Model.predict(Xtest)\r\n\r\nOrchestrator.setup(task, data, resampler)\r\n\r\n>Doesn’t seem to work in forecasting case?

thought a bit about the strategies.\r\n\r\nEventually, I think this should be the class for any Strategy, including unsupervised, time series, etc, so there should be a BaseStrategy, to inherit from.\r\n\r\nFrom these, strategies that solve a specific task type (e.g., TSC, TSR) should inherit. At that level, the task type variable gets specified, and becomes an immutable class variable.\r\n\r\nThe basic design of a *particular* strategy should inherit from the generic strategy for a specific task type, e.g., the mother TSC class. This should implement a *specific* strategy, similar to sklearn estimators. If it wraps a low-level strategy (in case exists for the task type), a *specific* estimator should be wrapped, e.g., called in the constructor.\r\n\r\nNow of course, it makes sense to have a factory for these specific strategies, such as the current design of strategy which can be provided a sklearn-like low-level estimator and meta-data, to make a strategy that is essentially a decorated piece of interface mutation.\r\n\r\nThe inheritence diagram I would hence draw as follows:\r\n\r\nBaseStrategy is the root of inheritance.\r\nTSsupStrategy inherits from
