This is unexpected, since the transformer ignores `y`.\r\n\r\nThis can be problematic in a `TransformedTargetPipeline` since there the forecaster's `X` - typically multivariate - is passed to the `y` of the transformers. (slightly surprising to me, but that's the status quo).\r\n\r\nThis implements a quick workaround, where the inner mtype for the `BoxCoxtransformer` is set to multivariate, that doesn't cause an error if a multivariate one is passed.\r\n\r\nNo other transformers are impacted currently, since `BoxCoxTransformer` is the only one refactored so far.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to think about how to fix this in the future. Options:\r\n* assume multivariate `y` by default, this will do a silent input conversion (which may be superfluous but won't cause an error)\r\n* introduce a tag on whether `y` is used internally, and in that case do not do a conversion at all (seems cleaner but introduces a new tag)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/989125290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5736068151,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc5ADj37zwAAAAFV5XQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5736068151","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-08T19:22:52Z","rename":{"from":"[BUG] BoxCoxTransformer does not ignore X, possible also other SeriesToSeriesTransformers affected?","to":"[BUG] BoxCoxTransformer does not ignore y, possible also other SeriesToSeriesTransformers affected?"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/989126113","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1725#issuecomment-989126113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1725","id":989126113,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc469N3h","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T19:23:38Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T19:23:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"PS: in the issue title, it should be `y`, not `X`, right?
