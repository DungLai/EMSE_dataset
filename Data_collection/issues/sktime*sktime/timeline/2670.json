As was mentioned in the community meeting however - it seems like the OptionalPassthrough transformer can already do most of what we would want to do with the MultiplexTransformer though performing a

(A solution which I was not aware of, thank you for bringing it up!)\r\n\r\nI was aware! I faintly remember that I may have said, written, or thought that `OptionalPassthrough` is, content-wise, equivalent to a `MultiplexTransformer` with the transformer that is the parameter, and an `IdentityTransformer`. So, the `OptionalPassthrough` would be the special case, the other way round I think it does not work.\r\n\r\nAlthough I´m not sure whether implementing it that way the best solution, it seems to me the two transformers - multiplexer, and `OptionalPassthrough` - are not obvious special cases of each other, interface-wise. It might still be good to have them implemented separately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1133173456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6652587510,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc5KHahCzwAAAAGMhm32","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6652587510","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T18:00:31Z","label":{"name":"API

(A solution which I was not aware of, thank you for bringing it up!)\r\n\r\n@miraep8, @aiwalter, can you explain how this would look like mathematically?\r\n\r\nThis claim does not seem correct to me. I do not think we can easily replace an instance of the `MultiplexTransformer` with `OptionalPassthrough`.\r\n\r\nHow would this work, formally? Can you give an example, let´s say, how we would replace a multiplexer over three transformers, A, B, C?\r\n\r\nWhat you say in your comment in question 1, @miraep8, sounds like a formal refutation of the claim, at least for a specific claimed equivalence, \"MultiplexTransformer(A, B, C) is equivalent to Pipeline(Opt(A), Opt(B), Opt(C))\" (I suspect @aiwalter said sth along these lines?)\r\n\r\nIt is a refutation due to your argument which I think is correct: we could end up having more than one transformer in the pipeline, e.g., a chain of A, B, as a realization, if we would approach this via a chain with each transformer wrapped in `OptionalPassthrough`. This cannot happen in a `MultiplexTransformer`, hence the two constructs cannot be equivalent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1133174512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6652593179,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5KHahCzwAAAAGMhoQb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6652593179","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T18:01:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6652593185,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5KHahCzwAAAAGMhoQh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6652593185","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T18:01:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6652593190,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5KHahCzwAAAAGMhoQm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6652593190","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T18:01:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6652593195,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5KHahCzwAAAAGMhoQr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6652593195","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com

It seems to me with the current system if we did something like this (borrowed from the docstring example for OptionalPassthrough)\r\n\r\n@miraep8 Actually this is currently not possible in sktime. Adding MultiplexTransformer will probably solve this, you are right.\r\n\r\n> Then we could actually end up with a situation where we either skip both deseasonalizer and scaler or include them both. One might imagine it could be nice in some situations to specify that we want exactly one transformer from a list of transformers. Having a MultiplexTransformer is one way to achieve this...\r\n\r\nGenerally when we are building forecasting applications, we expect GridSearchCV to find answers for us. So if the answer would be _deaseasonlizer_ true and _scaler_ false, then that would be detected through GSCV. But what if user just wants to pick only one transformer and not more? That's not possible to control as of current sktime classes. So MultiplexTransformer will be helpful there.\r\n\r\nAdditionally after reading through rapidfire comments from @fkiraly, I also agree with below - \r\n> This claim does not seem correct to me. I do not think we can easily replace an instance of the MultiplexTransformer with OptionalPassthrough.\r\n\r\nMultiplexTransformer will have more control over returned Transformers by controlling some parameter like return_n_best_transformers = 2. With OptionalPassthrough you can only benefit it when you wrap it in ForecastingGridSearchCV. So @fkiraly is right, actually. It seems it makes to add this in Sktime. So, the conceptual example I commented earlier, seems a bit out of context. \r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1133203685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"indinewton","id":25198189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk4MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25198189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton","html_url":"https://github.com/indinewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6652781175,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5KHahCzwAAAAGMiWJ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6652781175","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T18:41:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6652781182,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5KHahCzwAAAAGMiWJ-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6652781182","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T18:41:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
