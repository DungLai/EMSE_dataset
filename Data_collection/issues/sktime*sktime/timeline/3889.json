I have found the issue. \r\n\r\n@chillerobscuro `ConformalIntervals` works by constructing a `residuals_matrix` based on sliding window cross-validation of the training data. This means it splits the training data into further chunks while constructing the matrix.\r\n\r\n`ConformalIntervals` accepts an `initial_window` parameter which defines the size of the initial training set for the sliding window cross-validation. By default this is set as the larger of 0.1*len(y) and 10, which is smaller than your `AutoEnsembleForecaster` `test_size`, hence the error. \r\n\r\nThis is an imperfect default (as discussed in the above linked issue) but it is hard to cover every use case so we are planning to make better error messages to deal with this, which suggest setting your own `initial_window`.\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is to simply overwrite the default with something greater than your `AutoEnsembleForecaster` `test_size`. \r\n\r\nThis code snippet works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.conformal import

Am I composing the pipeline in an incompatible way or is this a further error worth investigating?\r\n\r\nCode with tree model included:\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.conformal import ConformalIntervals\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import AutoEnsembleForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.exp_smoothing import ExponentialSmoothing\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import ARIMA\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.detrend import Deseasonalizer, Detrender\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.trend import PolynomialTrendForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import make_reduction, TransformedTargetForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.regression.interval_based import TimeSeriesForestRegressor\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nytrain, ytest = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=24)\r\nprint(len(ytrain), len(ytest))\r\n\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(ytest.index, is_relative=False)\r\n\r\nes = ExponentialSmoothing(sp=12)\r\nar = ARIMA()\r\nregressor = TimeSeriesForestRegressor()\r\ntree_forecaster = TransformedTargetForecaster(\r\n    [\r\n        (\"deseasonalize\", Deseasonalizer(model=\"multiplicative\", sp=12)),\r\n        (\"detrend\", Detrender(forecaster=PolynomialTrendForecaster(degree=2))),\r\n        (\"forecast\", make_reduction(regressor, window_length=24, strategy=\"recursive\"),\r\n        ),\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n\r\nforecasters = [\r\n    (\"Tree\", tree_forecaster),\r\n    (\"AR\", ar),\r\n    (\"ES\", es)\r\n]\r\n\r\nae = AutoEnsembleForecaster(forecasters=forecasters, test_size=24, method='inverse-variance')\r\n\r\nconformal_forecaster = ConformalIntervals(ae, initial_window=48)\r\nconformal_forecaster.fit(ytrain, fh=fh)\r\n```\r\nOutput >\r\n```\r\n120 24\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nInput In [383], in <cell line: 40>()\r\n     37 ae = AutoEnsembleForecaster(forecasters=forecasters, test_size=24, method='inverse-variance')\r\n     39 conformal_forecaster = ConformalIntervals(ae, initial_window=48)\r\n---> 40 conformal_forecaster.fit(ytrain, fh=fh)\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/forecasting/base/_base.py:303, in BaseForecaster.fit(self, y, X, fh)\r\n    301 # we call the ordinary _fit if no looping/vectorization needed\r\n    302 if not vectorization_needed:\r\n--> 303     self._fit(y=y_inner, X=X_inner, fh=fh)\r\n    304 else:\r\n    305     # otherwise we call the vectorized version of fit\r\n    306     self._vectorize(\"fit\", y=y_inner, X=X_inner, fh=fh)\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/forecasting/conformal.py:150, in ConformalIntervals._fit(self, y, X, fh)\r\n    147 self.forecaster_.fit(y=y, X=X, fh=fh)\r\n    149 if self.fh_early_:\r\n--> 150     self.residuals_matrix_ = self._compute_sliding_residuals(\r\n    151         y=y,\r\n    152         X=X,\r\n    153         forecaster=self.forecaster,\r\n    154         initial_window=self.initial_window,\r\n    155         sample_frac=self.sample_frac,\r\n    156     )\r\n    158 return self\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/forecasting/conformal.py:411, in ConformalIntervals._compute_sliding_residuals(self, y, X, forecaster, initial_window, sample_frac, update)\r\n    405         warn(\r\n    406             f\"Couldn't predict after fitting on time series of length \\\r\n    407                          {len(y_train)}.\\n\"\r\n    408         )\r\n    409     return residuals\r\n--> 411 all_residuals = Parallel(n_jobs=self.n_jobs)(\r\n    412     delayed(_get_residuals_matrix_row)(forecaster.clone(), y, X, id)\r\n    413     for id in y_index\r\n    414 )\r\n    415 for idx, id in enumerate(y_index):\r\n    416     residuals_matrix.loc[id] = all_residuals[idx]\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/joblib/parallel.py:1043, in Parallel.__call__(self, iterable)\r\n   1034 try:\r\n   1035     # Only set self._iterating to True if at least a batch\r\n   1036     # was dispatched.

This is a tricky one but I think its due to `make_reduction` with `ConformalIntervals` when it is constructing the `residuals_matrix`. The `window_length` in `make_reduction` has to obey `window_length + max(fh) < len(y)`. \r\n\r\nWhen the `residuals_matrix` is being constructed its using a subset of `y_train`, where the smallest subset = the size of `initial_window`. With `initial_window = 48` this `= window_length + max(fh)`, so doesn't obey the `make_reduction` check where it needs to be more. So increase `initial_window` and it should work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1341345895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bethrice44","id":11226988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI2OTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11226988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44","html_url":"https://github.com/bethrice44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7980450724,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5YDFHgzwAAAAHbrAOk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7980450724","actor":{"login":"chillerobscuro","id":5232872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5232872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro","html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-07T17:51:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7980450732,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5YDFHgzwAAAAHbrAOs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7980450732","actor":{"login":"chillerobscuro","id":5232872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5232872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro","html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-07T17:51:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1341367599","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3889#issuecomment-1341367599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3889","id":1341367599,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5P86Uv","user":{"login":"chillerobscuro","id":5232872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5232872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro","html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T18:07:25Z","updated_

had a couple of cases where users reported unclear errors, coming from composites that broke due to a composite not satisfying implicit minimum length requirements (in data) of a component, e.g.:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3889\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3700\r\n\r\nI think we should take some space to think about whether there is a principled solution to this issue?\r\n\r\nA \"naive complete\" solution would be:\r\n\r\n* min length tag - this may depend on parameters, so may need to be set dynamically at the end of constructor, like other tags\r\n* \"implied min length for components\" tag, only for composites - can also depend on parameters\r\n\r\nIf the two are incompatible, informative error messages are raised.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that the implied min length tag can depend on parameters in quite a complex way, e.g., if a cross-validation constructor is also a parameter. In a case where there are many components (pipeline) it is possibly too complex to track even.\r\n\r\nA \"naive incomplete\" solution would be: min lenght tag only, but informative error is raised with the name of the component. That would at least allow the user a guess at what is happening where.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
