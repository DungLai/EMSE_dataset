2021-09-15 - re-opened since a recurring issue.\r\n\r\nNot a bug, but an interface convention - currently ARIMA, AutoARIMA and other learners fail when asked for a prediction that is undefined, e.g., difference parameter d=1 and first in-sample index (start=0).\r\n\r\nIt would be more sensible if `pandas.NA` is returned instead for such indices, perhaps a warning should be raised too that `pandas.NA` are produced.\r\n\r\nIn first instance, we should update ARIMA and AutoARIMA with this convention.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen using `Imputer` with `forecaster =

Reproduce**\r\n\r\nData:\r\n[df.csv](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/files/6426660/df.csv) \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.impute import Imputer\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import AutoARIMA\r\n\r\ndf = pd.read_csv('df.csv')  \r\ndf['timestamp'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['timestamp']).to_period('D')\r\ndf = df.set_index('timestamp')\r\n\r\ntransformer = Imputer(method=\"forecaster\", forecaster=AutoARIMA()).fit(Z=df.value)\r\ny_hat = transformer.transform(Z=df.value)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`transformer.transform(Z)` should return `Z` with NAn values replaced by AutoArima predictions.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI think the problem is in `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sktime/transformations/series/impute.py` in `transform(self, Z, X)`, line 100, because all the points are being passed to `fh_ins` instead of just the points with NaN.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n100             fh_ins = -np.arange(len(z))\r\n101             # fill NaN before fitting with ffill and backfill (heuristic)\r\n102             z_pred = forecaster.fit(\r\n103                 z.fillna(method=\"ffill\").fillna(method=\"backfill\")\r\n104             ).predict(fh=fh_ins)\r\n105             # fill with trend values\r\n106             z =

#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #859 and #1441 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nWhen training an AutoArima you don't know what differencing order it'll land at so if data changes at some point you won't be able to do in sample forecasts for some points (earlier to diff order). This implementation makes predictions possible (without errors) if they're ealier to differencing order.\r\nIt also fixes a small problem with appending out of sample to in sample predictions when intervals are to be returned.\r\n\r\n> #### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNope\r\n\r\n> #### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nif the code is clear enough, if the comments should be left.\r\n\r\n> #### PR checklist\r\n\r\n\r\n> ##### For all contributions\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n> ##### For new estimators\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/926021133","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1441#issuecomment-926021133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1441","id":926021133,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc43MfYN","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-23T17:40:09Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T17:40:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for raising the issue @IlyasMoutawwakil - we're currently working on refactoring the interface for probabilistic forecasting interval x(see #1421).
