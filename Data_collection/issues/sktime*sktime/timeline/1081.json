Most important is what is the difference between this and the EnsembleForecaster that already exists? Your design looks very similar to that.  Also, based on my understanding of AutoTheta, the current EnsembleForecaster does most of what we want. The only change is to create more aggfuncs:\r\n  * weighted mean, not just mean. this would involve adding some way for user to input the weights\r\n  * some kind of 'multiplicative' aggregation. This was in the AutoTheta paper. I do not know what it precisely means, but should not be too hard to find out.\r\n\r\n2. In my opinion, the PR #1082 is better for discussing code that is written and pushed, and this issue is better for discussing designs. If you agree, I suggest the following:\r\n  * Renaming this issue to something like 'Design and implementation of Col...Forecaster' to make it more distinct from the PR's name\r\n  * Move your class design from the PR as a comment in this issue)\r\n\r\n3.

Most important is what is the difference between this and the EnsembleForecaster that already exists?\r\n\r\nNever mind - I think I know the difference now. EnsembleForecaster is applying different forecasters to a *single* series, whereas ColumnEnsembleForecaster is applying different forecatsers to different series.\r\n\r\nHere are my further comments now that I understand the difference between the two:\r\n\r\n4. I think we want ColumnEnsembleForecaster to be a general multivariate-to-multivariate forecasting tool (not solely for ThetaForecasting): the user provides a list of forecasters which are applied to each column.\r\n    1. The specific use of trend and ses would be introduced inside ThetaForecaster, by doing something like `ColumnEnsembleForecaster(forecasters = [(\"trend\", PolynomialTrendForecaster(), [0]), (\"ses\", ExponentialSmoothing(), [1])]`\r\n5. If my thought in 4 is correct, then `predict` should return a multivariate output, i.e., the predictions for each of the series, without doing any means.\r\n    1. The calculation of the mean would happen inside the ThetaForecaster\r\n\r\n6. Jumping ahead, I envision the final ThetaForecaster being defined as some kind of *reduction from univariate to multivariate forecasting*:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nThetaForecaster = univariate_via_multivariate(\r\n    uni_to_multi_transformer = ThetaLinesTransformer([0,2]),\r\n    multi_forecaster = ColumnEnsembleForecaster(forecasters = [(\"trend\", PolynomialTrendForecaster(), [0]), (\"ses\", ExponentialSmoothing(), [1])],\r\n    multi_to_uni_transformer/aggfunc = 'mean')\r\n```\r\n@mloning @fkiraly @GuzalBulatova. Let me know which, if any, of my comments are sensible or not. I could easily be over-complicating things or misunderstood

I renamed the issue and moved class design into comment section here.\r\n\r\nRegarding comment nr 4: I should've been more verbose with the design suggestion. \r\n\r\n`ColumnEnsemble` is a part of `ThetaForecaster`. Theta itself would look like:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n# modular theta forecasting\r\nThetaForecaster = Pipeline(\r\n    Deseasonalizer()\r\n    ThetaLinesTransformer(theta=(0, 2, ...)), \r\n    ColumnEnsembleForecaster()\r\n)\r\npipe.fit(y)\r\npipe.predict(fh)\r\n```\r\nJust like you said, average will be **weighted,** not just mean, mean is the simple option to start (classic theta case).\r\nBut I think we should make `ColumnEnsemble` as multivariate-to-univariate, mixing in multivariate output will complicate it too much, but maybe I'm wrong. @mloning and @fkiraly what do you think? \r\n\r\nMaybe `ColumnEnsemble` should be a special case of multivariate-to-multivariate forecaster. Still I think combining the forecasts - returning univariate pd.Series should be separate class. Is averaging multiple forecasts is used somewhere else or is it just Theta method?\r\n\r\n`AutoTheta` would try different theta coefficients and pick the best one (based on MAE if I understand the paper correctly).\r\n```python\r\npipe = Pipeline(\r\n\r\n    ThetaLinesTransformer(theta=(0, 2, ...)), \r\n    ColumnEnsembleForecaster()\r\n)\r\n\r\nparam_grid = {\"theta\": [(0, 2), (0, 2.3),

I do like this idea.\r\n\r\nOne point I wanted to bring up is the handling of input and output types - the `ColumnEnsembleForecaster` takes a multivariate series and produces a univariate one. The theta transformer takes a univariate and produces a multivariate. I don't think we have agreed on conventions.\r\n\r\nAlso, you allude to the initial conversion series->frame being done in the base class.\r\n\r\nMy thought would be that after #980 this would be automatically taken care of (and input/output types do not matter in the implementation), but in any case we need to think carefully about the conversions and the types involved. There seem to be a lot of case distinctions if we want to have the logic in `_fit`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/873436510/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4974372574,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk3NDM3MjU3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4974372574","actor":{"login":"GuzalBulatova","id":73598322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTk4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73598322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova","html_url":"https://github.com/GuzalBulatova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-03T16:52:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4974372577,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5NzQzNzI1Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4974372577","actor":{"login":"GuzalBulatova","id":73598322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTk4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73598322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova","html_url":"https://github.com/GuzalBulatova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-03T16:52:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
