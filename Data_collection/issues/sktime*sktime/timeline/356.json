for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nIssue #356 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nAn example is given how to read DICOM waveform and bringing it quickly to a format where one can use sktime.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nIn order to to run the example (notebook) 'pydicom' is needed.\r\nAlso note that a .dcm file was introduced in the example directory (the file was taken from https://github.com/marcodebe/dicom-ecg-plot)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nThe original issue suggests to create a .ts file. This was not done. Only the minimum demonstration is included; a DICOM file is loaded and is used in memory quickly with sktime.\r\nThe issue also mentions a desire for classification / clustering demonstration, yet my understanding is that this would be unnecessary repeat of other sktime tutorials.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to create more relevant and complete code / utilities / examples, yet maybe above is just what needed, as the DICOM format is very flexible and one may be introduced with different settings.\r\n\r\nThis PR can be either merged as is, or can be considered a WIP. Happy for any guidance.\r\nMaybe makes sense to merge this PR and to open new relevant issue(s) to be implemented (by me) in additional increments.\r\n\r\nWKR, Oren.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/415/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4175625830,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE3NTYyNTgzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4175625830","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-06T15:06:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"shreshtha48","id":66861681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODYxNjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66861681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48","html_url":"https://github.com/shreshtha48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreshtha48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-08T16:00:06Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T16:00:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/785","id":852775208,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4NTI3NzUyMDg=","number":785,"title":"Loading

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI am not sure if this has been discussed or not, but I wanted to know if there is a way to load datasets with .fif, and .edf format? I have been drafting my gsoc proposal for the project and there is a high chance that I will come across these formats as I plan to use MNE library along with sktime for the EEG data analysis \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n What I'm trying to do here is write a function that converts .fif or .edf data into csv. I am looking for ways to interpret this solution. With the MNE library in python, csv is not a supported file format but in order to convert the  csv to the required format, we can read the csv with numpy and create a raw MNE object. I was wondering if something similar could be implemented here?\r\n  converting the .csv data into the required MNE data format looks something like this:\r\n```\r\nimport` numpy as np\r\nimport mne\r\n\r\n# Read the CSV file as a NumPy array\r\ndata = np.loadtxt('path/to/csv/file', delimiter=',')\r\n\r\n# Some information about the channels\r\nch_names = ['CH 1', 'CH 2', 'CH 3']  # TODO: finish this list\r\n\r\n# Sampling rate of the Nautilus machine\r\nsfreq = 500  # Hz\r\n\r\n# Create the info structure needed by MNE\r\ninfo = mne.create_info(ch_names, sfreq)\r\n\r\n# Finally, create the Raw object\r\nraw = mne.io.RawArray(data, info)\r\n\r\n# Plot it!\r\nraw.plot()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
