Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nSee #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAddresses a few bullet points in #2416\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Removed a restriction on the `Reconciler` which required the bottom level nodes to have unique names at that level by changing the `_get_s_matrix()` function\r\n- Added check for any difference between indexes used in `.fit()` and `.transform()`\r\n- Test the reconciled predictions actually sum appropriately\r\n- Test the index/columns on the summation (S) and G matrices match\r\n- Test the methods work equally for named and unnamed indexes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nThe added tests :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6600133835,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5HZon0zwAAAAGJZgzL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6600133835","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"117530d27c6f1e51b7516f1df6b4db2cc97cd5e5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/117530d27c6f1e51b7516f1df6b4db2cc97cd5e5","created_at":"2022-05-12T17:15:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
