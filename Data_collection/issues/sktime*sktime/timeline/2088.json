the bug**\r\nWhen using a `ForecastingPipeline`, the checks for prediction interval need to be based on the final forecaster in the pipeline but currently this does not seem to be the case.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import ForecastingPipeline\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.impute import Imputer\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\ny_train, _, X_train, X_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, X)\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(X_test.index, is_relative=False)\r\n\r\n# This works ----\r\nforecaster = ThetaForecaster()\r\nforecaster.fit(y_train, X_train, fh=fh)\r\nforecaster.predict_quantiles(X=X_test, alpha=[0.05, 0.5, 0.95])\r\n\r\n# But this does not ----\r\npipe = ForecastingPipeline(steps=[\r\n    (\"imputer\", Imputer()),\r\n    (\"forecaster\", ThetaForecaster())])\r\npipe.fit(y_train, X_train, fh=fh)\r\npipe.predict_quantiles(X=X_test, alpha=[0.05, 0.5, 0.95])\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nRuntimeError: ForecastingPipeline does not implement probabilistic forecasting, but \"capability:pred_int\" flag has been set to True incorrectly. This is likely a bug, please report, and/or set the flag to False.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWould have expected the `ForecastingPipeline` to look at the underlying `ThetaForcester` for capability and run to completion i.e. produce the same results as `forecaster.predict_quantiles(X=X_test, alpha=[0.05, 0.5, 0.95])`. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\nSystem:\r\n    python:

PR partially resolves #1364 and #2088, it enables `MultiplexForecaster` to work with multivariate, hierarchical, and/or probabilistic forecasters.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by replacing manual loopthrough with:\r\n\r\n* tag cloning\r\n* delegation via the general `_DelegatedForecaster` (which includes the probabilistic methods and will also pick up any future method that is added)\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains:\r\n* docstring improvements in the `_HeterogeneousMetaEstimator`\r\n* a docstring fix, added missing default value for parameter `deep` in `get_params` throughout the code base\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on:\r\n* refactor and fixes to `update_predict` in
