While we're at it, why not consider [`joblib`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html#model-persistence) as the third contender?\n\nI believe joblib \"loky\" uses cloudpickle under the hood as default. https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/serialization_and_wrappers.html\n\nMy vote is for cloudpickle. 1. It's been heavily battle rested for ETL and data science workflows as Dask's default serialiser; 2. Quite a few of sktime's estimators store \"state\" in internal memory that probably won't be bundled in a pickle pickle; 3. Cloudpickle serialisation can be slower (though note that it's fast enough for Dask) but nothing is worse than the developer time required to debug a pickled object that fails to deserialise

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nFixes #3022\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThe Save/Load function for classical estimators is from #3336 and has been expanded for DL models along the same design. Keras is known to be problematic for certain kinds of (de)serialization, so this uses `model.save()` from `keras` along with `pickle.dump()`. The estimators are saved as `.zip` files.\r\n\r\nComponents of this directory include:\r\n1. Metadata\r\n2. Object\r\n3. Keras History\r\n4. Keras Model subdirectory\r\n\r\nThe first two components are the same as previously mentioned PR, stored differently to [avoid](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3336#issuecomment-1242013162) this problem.\r\n\r\nAll the attributes are saved and restored (optimizers/history etc.) appropriately.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nOne thing in `__getstate__()` and `__setstate__()` might be a source of contention, I've explained why it was necessary and I believe it is the simplest solution.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1303090504","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3672#issuecomment-1303090504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3672","id":1303090504,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Nq5VI","user":{"login":"achieveordie","id":54197164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTk3MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54197164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie","html_url":"https://github.com/achieveordie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-04T08:00:41Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T08:00:41Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I must say that I can't find any faults/cons in using `cloudpickle` than what you've already mentioned.
