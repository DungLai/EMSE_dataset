I'll like to know how to handle forecasting in multivariate time series with sktime.\r\nLet's say I have two time series variables energy load and temperature (or even including 3rd variable, var3) at hourly intervals and I'm interested in forecasting the load demand only  for the next 48hrs.\r\n1- Would it suffice to treat this as a univariate time series forcasting by discarding the other variables (temperature and var3)?\r\n2- If i want to keep both variables but forecast on energy load, how would this be treated with sktime?\r\n\r\n**Update to this question:**\r\n**@mloning** , you responded earlier that this could be treated as a univariate time series with exogenous variables.\r\nPls I'll like to know how I can implement this (with **multiple exogenous variables**) in sktime by reduction to tabularized features and using ML algorithms like decision tree , KNN regression etc.\r\nI would like to compare the result with the statistical method like SARIMAX which I read (though not yet confirmed) that sktime also interfaces
