Discussed in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/discussions/2451\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **anthonygiorgio97** April 13, 2022</sup>\r\nI was trying to do a Pipeline with transformers for both exogenous X (4 features) and endogenous y variable with a FeatureSelection(), a LogTransformer() and a Differencer() combined with a cross validation to tune Prophet (but the same happen with other algorithms). The difference operator must exclude the first index from both exogenous and endogenous variable (because I have specified this transformation both in ForecastingPipeline and TransformedTargetForecaster), but when I call the fit method this error raise: \r\n\r\n(time) indices of series 0 are not contained in index of series 0, extra indices are: DatetimeIndex(['2016-01-31'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n\r\nwhere 2016-01-31 is the first index. If I use a classic Detrender() the code work, but I want to try with the Differencer() operator.\r\n\r\nI am using sktime 0.11.0. This is the code I am using:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npipe_prophet = ForecastingPipeline(steps=[\r\n        (\"selection\", FeatureSelection(method = 'columns')),\r\n        (\"logX\",

OptionalPassthrough(LogTransformer())),\r\n            (\"differencer\", Differencer()),\r\n            (\"prophet\", Prophet(yearly_seasonality='auto'))\r\n        ]))  \r\n])\r\n\r\ncv = ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_window = len(train_model) - (N_cv_fold - 1) * step_cv - len(fh),\r\n                            start_with_window = True,\r\n                            step_length =

Cause of the bug: \r\n\r\nI have found the cause of this bug.  It is coming from the use of `Differencer` with `drop_na = True`. \r\n\r\nThis setup means that `X` ends up being shortened by `sum(lags)` (`lags` is a variable in `Differencer`, ie to see an example with lags = [1], you run into the issue where [a, b, c, d] gives [?, b-a, c-b, d-c], and with these params `?` just gets dropped).   But by being shortened `X` causes some issues downstream. \r\n\r\nTo see this, neither of these versions of the pipeline raise the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\npipe = TransformedTargetForecaster(steps = [\r\n            (\"log\", OptionalPassthrough(LogTransformer())),\r\n            (\"differencer\", Differencer(na_handling = \"fill_zero\")),\r\n            (\"scaler\", TabularToSeriesAdaptor(StandardScaler())),\r\n            (\"myforecasterpipe\", ForecastingPipeline(steps = [\r\n                (\"logX\", OptionalPassthrough(LogTransformer())),\r\n                (\"differencerX\", Differencer(na_handling = \"fill_zero\")),\r\n                (\"scalerX\", TabularToSeriesAdaptor(StandardScaler())),\r\n                (\"myforecaster\", make_reduction(SVR()))\r\n        ]))  \r\n])\r\n```\r\n```\r\npipe = TransformedTargetForecaster(steps = [\r\n            (\"log\", OptionalPassthrough(LogTransformer())),\r\n            (\"scaler\", TabularToSeriesAdaptor(StandardScaler())),\r\n            (\"myforecasterpipe\", ForecastingPipeline(steps = [\r\n                (\"logX\", OptionalPassthrough(LogTransformer())),\r\n                (\"scalerX\", TabularToSeriesAdaptor(StandardScaler())),\r\n                (\"myforecaster\", make_reduction(SVR()))\r\n        ]))  \r\n])\r\n```\r\nFun side note - the error isn't raised in the case `fh = [1,2]` because in this case `X` ends up being a 1D array, and python allows you to use it to overwrite 2 columns simultaneously, ie we are in the case where we are trying to set `(1,5,2) = (5,1)`.  So I would say that it is still broken in this case even though we don't get the error. \r\n\r\n### What to do next:\r\n\r\nOne idea I had, was that if `Differencer` (or another transformer that shortens `X` is in a pipeline) then the shape of `X` should be increased prior to running predict to account for the columns that will be lost. (ie, I think the way it works now is that `X` is based on `fh`, but maybe we could try to change it so that it is `fh + num cols lost` or something similar.  That would help ensure that `X` ends up being the correct length at the end of the pipeline for the final prediction.   Open to other suggestions as well though!

Contextual awareness of estimators is imo one of many pathways to hell, can you think of a way that would not require it?\r\n\r\nI totally agree! I think my plan was not to make `Differencer` contextually away but pipelines!  ie - pipelines are aware of all the steps and *in theory* should be able to count the number of lost columns and adjust the input accordingly.  To me this seems like it could be an appropriate place to do so, then we could encourage anyone chaining together transformers/forecasters to use the pipelining features.

(even if just one step?)\r\n\r\n> Re this very bug: do you think it's solved by the changes to Differencer parameters, or is more action needed?\r\n\r\nI think it is \"solved\" by no longer raising errors, but I suspect statistically it might not be doing what the original author intended... (due to the issues above) so I would potentially be hesitant to mark it as fully solved.  I have a potential workaround in mind that might not require changing the code base (but is in-elegant) by just splitting the pipeline into 2 parts - a transformer-style pipeline that reduces the dimension by 1 (ie starts out with fh one larger) and then feeding the output of that pipeline into a `TransformedTargetForecaster` which has the remainder of the original steps.

PR loosens checks related to index equality related tags:\r\n\r\n* if a forecaster has `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` and `\"ignores-exogeneous-X\"` tag both set to True, this will no longer result in an exception if `X` is passed and is not index compliant with `y`. Why: if `X` is ignored, then `X.index` should also not matter for anything, including checks.\r\n* In transformer and forecaster pipelines, the `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` tag is no longer copied from forecaster or conjunction-inferred from transformers. This was logically incorrect, as there are transformers that can add or remove indices. There have been actual instances of unexpected behaviour around this in pipelines. Example 1: `Aggregator` which adds indices https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2711; example 2: `Differencer` which removes indices https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2807, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2452\r\n(FYI @ngupta23, @anthonygiorgio97)\r\n* if a forecaster has `\"ignores-exogeneous-X\"`, then `X=None` is passed to the inner methods, instead of performing unnecessary conversions on `X` and passing the result to the inner methods. This is done after performing input checks on `X`, to let the user know early of non-conformant `X` - even if `X` is never used.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds two tests that ensure that the ablated examples from https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2711 run.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-27T13:24:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T13:24:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2880","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2880/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2880/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2880/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2880","id":1285805532,"node_id":"I_kwDOCVKAsc5Mo9Xc","number":2880,"title":"[ENH] Design Discussion around pipelines and transformers which change element size.

Essentially one can pre-transform the data for all the steps up to and including the one which changes size.  Then you can continue with the rest of the pipeline as before.  One disadvantage of this solution is that it makes it harder to automate either including or not including the `Log-Transformer` with `OptionalPassthrough`  In the meantime I suggest the original user who raised this issue compare the best solutions available both with and without that transformer manually.  (and hopefully we will arrive at a cleaner solution soon)\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import make_reduction, ForecastingPipeline, TransformedTargetForecaster\r\nfrom

one reasonable solution may be that even though we are using these pipelines as forecasters, we might not actually need to trim X for the actual forecasting step until the final step which actually performs the forecasting?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1167350732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1167428642","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2807#issuecomment-1167428642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2807","id":1167428642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5FlYwi","user":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-27T14:30:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T14:30:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@fkiraly,
