See also https://github.com/intive-DataScience/tbats/issues/35 for discussion. \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nImplements update method for tbats, which allows users to update state fo the model with new observations (fast) without refitting model parameters (slow). Particualrly, useful for walk-forward prediction and validation.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo new dependencies were introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nThere are a number of potential places I could implement this change. I thought the _tbats.py file with the adapter class was the most natural but let me know if this was not the intended design / pattern. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nThis is my first contribution to a public code base.
