Where to put the rotation forest and the continue interval tree classifiers. These are standard vector classifiers, not time series classifiers, used within time series classifiers. I think we should just locate them within the file containing the time series classifier of interest.\r\n\r\nThese are `sklearn` compatible classifiers, correct?\r\nSo, I would put them into a `classification_sklearn` dir, and ensure we have tests in there which run the `sklearn` `check_estimator` on the classifiers.\r\n\r\n> 2. clustering_experiments and classification_experiments are central to how we run experiments. These are moving to an sktime-estimator-evaluation sub package (still private at the moment).\r\n\r\nInstead of doing that, please make sure you align with the benchmarking workstream. You have committed to write benchmarking code for classifiers in 2019 https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/12, which you haven't done.\r\n\r\nThere is a current benchmarking workstream via GSoC, an now I'm hearing this for the first time, you are again cooking your own things and trying to move things out of the `sktime` package.\r\n\r\nPlease work with the rest of the community, `sktime` is not just your own research group, and benchmarking time series classifiers is not just your turf.\r\n\r\n> My goal is to have this done by the time the grant starts.\r\n\r\nAs [per the CC decision on May 31](https://github.com/sktime/community-org/blob/main/community_council/previous_meetings/20220531-meeting.md), you are not going to split `sktime` into multiple packages, or work on benchmarking in separation from community led workstreams, since this does not have express approval by the sktime community.

first issue, most of these seem like smaller refactor tasks. If taking, please say which of the sub-tasks you would like to work on.\r\n\r\nSuggested actions:\r\n\r\n- [ ] `clustering` - plotting functionality for clustering. Move to `sktime.clustering` module.\r\n- [ ] `datasets` - duplication of `sktime.datasets`. https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3518\r\n- [ ] `diagram_code` - critical difference diagrams. https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3519\r\n- [ ] `distance_based` looks like a time series classifier. Move to `classification`.\r\n- [ ] `windows_installation` - install instructions. Move to docs, sub-page of install instructions.\r\n- [ ] `_classification_test_reproduction` - tests, should move to `TestAllClassifiers` or `TestAllEarlyClassifiers`, duplications removed\r\n- [ ] `_plot_path` - plotting functionality for alignment. Move to `sktime.alignment` module.\r\n- [ ] `classifier_capabilities_table` - could go in the docs, next to the estimator table\r\n- [ ] `set_classifier`, `set_clusterer`. Not sure why needed, but if needed should be refactored so there is not a million if/else but refs are by class name string. Parameter settings could to into `get_test_params`.\r\n- [x] `ShapeletTransform` - transformer, move to `sktime.transformations`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1177577612","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2947#issuecomment-1177577612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2947","id":1177577612,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5GMGiM","user":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-07T13:01:40Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T14:50:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fkiraly clustering_experiments and classification_experiments use the benchmarking package.

And, that you are trying to move it out, now of all times, where we have summer projects that mean to make benchmarking easy to use.\r\n\r\nBenchmarking classifiers and forecasters is a functionality that I'm sure a lot of users would want to see.\r\nIt is something I have also repeatedly suggested you make available to general users of `sktime`.\r\n\r\nWhy are you not moving it into a form so everyone can use it easily? Not just Tony's research team?\r\n\r\nWhy are you now, that we have people working on benchmarking, trying to move it out of `sktime` into some private location in Tony's research group?
