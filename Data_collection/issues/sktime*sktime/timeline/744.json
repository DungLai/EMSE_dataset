I have just seen that my previous statement partially incorrect:\r\n\r\n> I have checked the` sklearn.Imputer` and they also dont have an `inverse_tranform`\r\n\r\nThis statement was correct, but `sklearn.Imputer` is depreciated and was replaced with `sklearn.SimpleImputer`, which now has an `inverse_transform` method. So my idea is to copy it ideally for `sktime.Imputer`. Also this might then work for `HampelFilter` as well.\r\n\r\n> how you would like Imputer and HampelFilter to behave, specifically?\r\n\r\nSo the main purpose is to use the `fit_transform` method and to ideally tune the hyperparameters together with a forecaster and other transformers inside a `TransformedTargetForecaster`. Regarding `inverse_transform` I have only one requirement, which is to enhance tuning. The way we implement `inverse_transform` is for me thus not a particular requirement, but as stated I will try to copy the approach from `sklearn`, maybe I can even inherit sth.\r\n\r\n___\r\nMartin

`inverse_transform`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/810033180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-08T12:32:25Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T12:32:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/788","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/788/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/788/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/788/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/788","id":853424217,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjExNTE2NDQ4","number":788,"title":"Added
