Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n- [ ] Moving the `convert_y_to_keras` function in `BaseDeepClassifier` into a utils function\r\n- [x] Enable returning the `label_encoder` and `one hot encoder` to the user from `convert_y_to_keras` (it can be useful for the users in case they want to use it to encode other data / or to decode data later on)\r\n- [x] Add option to have multiple linear layers in output layer / different activation function. Also add the `use_bias` parameter to output layer. (simply as a customisation option to users, multiple linear layers are useful to create deeper networks depending on dataset / choice of activation function)\r\n- [x] option to choose optimiser (usually its Adam but just for customisation's sake we can give this as option as well). Also should allow specifying `lr` either within the optimiser or as parameter to the class itself.\r\n- [x] Accept parameter as input in `CNNClassifier` to specify `random seed`\r\n- [ ] Train/fit the model on GPU depending on users choice (maybe take an input parameter for this as well)\r\n- [x] Option to view / return the loss of fit (either as a graph or simply as a list / array )\r\n\r\n#####

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThe Save/Load function for classical estimators is from #3336 and has been expanded for DL models along the same design. Keras is known to be problematic for certain kinds of (de)serialization, so this uses `model.save()` from `keras` along with `pickle.dump()`. The estimators are saved as `.zip` files.\r\n\r\nComponents of this directory include:\r\n1. Metadata\r\n2. Object\r\n3. Keras History\r\n4. Keras Model subdirectory\r\n\r\nThe first two components are the same as previously mentioned PR, stored differently to [avoid](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3336#issuecomment-1242013162) this problem.\r\n\r\nAll the attributes are saved and restored (optimizers/history etc.) appropriately.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
