is broken for all composite forecasters in the following way:\r\n\r\nIf it is run once for a composite with a component, the `cutoff` of the composite is reset, but not that of the component. This leads to unexpected behaviour and non-compliant predictions when `update_predict` is called a second time.\r\n\r\nThis is due to a fundamental bug in the design of the `detached_cutoff` that is used internally.\r\n\r\nAn example is the test failure in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2248, in combination with #2555.\r\n\r\nAnother minimal example of this behaviour is this, in #2248:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing.series import _make_series\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import BaggingForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import SlidingWindowSplitter\r\n\r\nX = _make_series()\r\nX1 = X[:24]\r\nX2 = X[24:36]\r\nf = BaggingForecaster.create_test_instance()\r\nf.fit(X1, fh=[1, 2])\r\n\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(start_with_window=False)\r\nf.update_predict(X2, cv=cv)\r\nf.update_predict(X2, cv=cv)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is that returns of both `update_predict` are identical, and that the `cutoff` of the internal estimator does not change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-26T23:00:30Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T23:00:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2248","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2248/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2248/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2248/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/2248","id":1173982611,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc40rTFQ","number":2248,"title":"[ENH]

PR fixes within-test side effects discovered by https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2555.\r\n\r\nHigh-level, the changes ensure that clones and copies are made by test *run*, as opposed to by *test* but not by *test run* (a test could have multiple test runs).\r\n\r\nFollowing changes are made to address and solve #2555:\r\n* new tests in `TestAllEstimators` that test if estimator instance state is preserved across tests or test instances, for a given estimator. Without any additional changes, the \"within test\" variant fails, i.e., the `estimator_instance` fixture retains state changes across runs of the same test. This needed to be addressed in `TestAllEstimator` and `check_estimator`, which had similar but slightly different logic to pass fixtures to the tests.\r\n* the issue is addressed in `TestAllEstimator` by making the `estimator_instance` fixture indirect, and creating a new instance of `estimator_instance` (via `clone`) via the `pytest.fixture` and \"indirect fixture\" formalism. A class variable is added to `TestAllEstimator`, usable by descendants, to indicate which fixtures are indirect.\r\n* the issue is addressed in `check_estimator` by making a `deepcopy` before arguments are passed on to tests. This also seems to speed up the `check_estimator` runtime and tests considerably.\r\n\r\nFurther changes:\r\n* docstring changes to uniformize occurrences of \"parametrize\" and \"parameterize\"\r\n* a `deepcopy_fixtuers` argument in `create_conditional_fixtures_and_names` which allows finer control on whether returned fixtures are reference identical or not. The default is set to `False`, i.e., fixtures are returned reference identical, since now the testing machinery makes the clones/copies, per test run.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6526009690,"node_id":"ATPE_lADOCVKAsc5IgzyIzwAAAAGE-wFa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6526009690","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-29T20:05:55Z","project_card":{"id":81317002,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/81317002","project_id":14035628,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/14035628","column_name":"Should

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe forecasting test [`test_update_predict_predicted_index`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/df683766f4af7fd7fbe339fbf306d7a560827574/sktime/forecasting/tests/test_all_forecasters.py#L520) does the following:\r\n1. splits a time series y in `y_train` and `y_test`. \r\n2. fits a forecasting algorithm using `y_train`\r\n3. calls `update_predict` on the fitted forecaster using `y_test` and a `SlidingWindowSplitter`. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the test is that the first non-trivial update call uses data that are more than one time step ahead than the data passed in fit. As a result when we try to reconcile `y_train` and the subset of `y_test` from the splitter the resulting time series has gaps and frequency None. For some reason this was not causing any forecasting algorithm to break apart from `BaggingForecaster` in #2248 and in only 2 test cases ([see CI log](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/runs/6397105019?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:47103)).\r\n\r\nThe following code reproduces the behaviour of the test:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing.series import _make_series\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import (\r\n    SlidingWindowSplitter,\r\n    temporal_train_test_split,\r\n)\r\n\r\nn_columns = 1\r\nfh_int_oos = [2, 5]\r\nwindow_length = 1\r\nstep_length = 5\r\n\r\ny = _make_series(n_columns=n_columns, all_positive=True, index_type=\"datetime\")\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    fh_int_oos,\r\n    window_length=window_length,\r\n    step_length=step_length,\r\n    start_with_window=False,\r\n)\r\n\r\nprint(f\"max date seen during fit: {y_train.index.max()}\")\r\ncounter = 0\r\nfor train_idx, test_idx in cv.split(y_test):\r\n    print(f\"split {counter} min date seen during update: {y_test.iloc[train_idx].index.min()}\")\r\n    counter += 1\r\n\r\n# Prints:\r\n# max date seen during fit: 2000-02-06 00:00:00\r\n# split 0 min date seen during update: NaT\r\n# split 1 min date seen during update: 2000-02-11 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHaving a complete time series is a fair requirement from a forecasting algorithm, the test should reflect this.\r\nUsing the `ExpandingWindowSlicer` instead of the `SlidingWindowSplitter` will fix this.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNot implementing BaggingForecaster\r\n\r\n⚠️ **Disclaimer** ⚠️\r\nThere's a good chance that my conclusion that the test needs some changes is wrong and there's a valid reason for it being that way.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2700/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6743221650,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5IgzyIzwAAAAGR7WWS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6743221650","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-05T06:42:27Z","project_card":{"id":81317002,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/81317002","project_id":14035628,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/14035628","column_name":"Done","previous_column_name":"Should have"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7503733595,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5IgzyIzwAAAAG_QeNb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7503733595","actor":{"login":"mukul-kr","id":74813712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODEzNzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74813712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr","html_url":"https://github.com/mukul-kr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mukul-kr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-03T04:53:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
