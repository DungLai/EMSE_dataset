I guess I was just unsure of how (or if even) to allow the forecasters to refit when data comes in. I think I'll first consider the simpler case where no refit is needed for the forecaster and rather the ensemble will fit itself during a validation stretch of data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/650506120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"magittan","id":14024202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI0MjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14024202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan","html_url":"https://github.com/magittan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"magittan","id":14024202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI0MjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14024202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan","html_url":"https://github.com/magittan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magittan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T03:27:44Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T03:27:44Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/333","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/333/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/333/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/333/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/333","id":651220815,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDQ0NTE2NDI1","number":333,"title":"New

Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe extension guidelines: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nRefers to #271 for implementing New Online Ensemble Forecasting Methods\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nThis implements hedge based DTOL for choosing how to weight different forecasters in an online format, I included some implementations of these algorithms with more to come:\r\n- NormalHedge\r\n- Hedge (Incremental/Doubling)\r\n\r\nI also included one that is very similar to stacking that performs a non-negative least squares fit from the forecasters to the output.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\nCurrently, the online experts algorithms are included as a script, but as more are added, it would be good to include more in a dedicated repository for online experts.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\nFor the 'OnlineEnsembleForecaster' I have:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n- [x] I have updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my algorithm works.\r\n- [x] I have updated sktime's [estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nI also added a cv method called 'OnlineSplitter' which helps me control the behavior of update_predict for forecasting in an online fashion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/333/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/804756979","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/271#issuecomment-804756979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/271","id":804756979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDc1Njk3OQ==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T09:36:00Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T09:36:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closed
