so for the .ts format, the idea is to read the data type from the file header, removing the need to explicitly check or convert. We are starting to look at larger problems (EEG are often 10-100 GB), so we need to minimize unnecessary checking. If the file does not match the header (e.g. unequal length data registered as equal in header) it will throw an exception. For other formats, the idea is to load into dataframe as we always have done, then use check and convert it get it into the best format.
