few useful change to improve our release/distribution cycle:\r\n\r\n- [x] compile manylinux wheels (see #188)\r\n- [x] set up CI to directly upload wheels to PyPI\r\n- [x] include Makefile to automise release workflow (see this [intro](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/make/make.html), also see e.g. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CleverCSV/blob/master/make_release.py)\r\n- [x] enforce code formatting in released code (see #208, #256)\r\n- [x] add coverage for unit tests (see #394)\r\n- [ ] add code quality/climate checks (see https://lgtm.com, https://www.codacy.com, https://github.com/marketplace/code-climate, etc)\r\n- [ ] consider [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/tree/master/cibuildwheel) package to simplify wheel building across platforms\r\n- [ ] improve packaging for macOS wheels with [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate), also included in cibuildwheel, also see https://iscinumpy.gitlab.io/post/azure-devops-python-wheels/ \r\n- [x] distribute sktime via conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/#contribute (see #326)\r\n- [x] set up [pre-commit config](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/) (see #394)\r\n- [x] add Black for code formatting (see #394)\r\n- [x] add [check-manifest](https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/) (see #394)\r\n- [x] add [bugbear](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-bugbear/) to flake8 (see #394)\r\n- [x] update setup.cfg, see e.g. https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram/blob/develop/setup.cfg (see #394)\r\n- [ ] check out other [flake8 extensions](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions)\r\n- [ ] add checks for broken website links: https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastlinkcheck/\r\n- [ ] use GitHub Action to check if Binder works and pre-build Docker images for quicker launch: https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action#use-github-actions-to-cache-the-build-for-binderhub \r\n- [ ] explore [pre-commit-ci](https://pre-commit.ci) as suggested in #794 \r\n\r\n#### Extra resources\r\n* For building/distribution on GitHub Actions checkout: https://scikit-hep.org/developer/gha_wheels\r\n* Useful links from [reproducible research lunch](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/746)  \r\n* scikit-learn's [release process](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/maintainer.html) \r\n* Check out https://python-poetry.org thanks to @hiqbal2\r\n* Consider [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) for versioning (software configuration management)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/580725600","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/223#issuecomment-580725600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/223","id":580725600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDcyNTYwMA==","user":{"login":"mcsage","id":6553776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTM3NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6553776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage","html_url":"https://github.com/mcsage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcsage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-31T13:05:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T13:05:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We
