a bit debatable where the bug is in this case. The `?utf-8` for non-latin characters is generally a valid way of representing utf-8 data. The issue here is that PyPI doesn't parse it and just shows it verbatim.\r\n\r\nThe big question is... why is setuptools sending it as `?utf-8` anyhow as the http request already uses utf-8 and it can send utf-8 natively.\r\n\r\nI should note that using the `setup.cfg` instead of the `pyproject.toml` results in the same broken data.\r\nI'm pretty sure it's a setuptools bug in conjunction with non-latin characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case...
