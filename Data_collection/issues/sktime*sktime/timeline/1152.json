My forthcoming PR will handle that as well. \r\n\r\nIt also updates the templates for documenting classes (shows methods as mentioned above and also generates auto-summary table of methods). \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm just trying to sort through an issue where tweaks I make to the docstrings help to make docs render better and get rid of some warnings/errors when I run `make html` allow the docs to render like I expect but aren't making the underlying warning going away. For example, we have cases where we've left the 's' of the end of a docstring section (e.g. Return not Returns, Example not Examples). I've correct and docstrings are rendering but I'm still getting a warning that the class contains unknown section `Example` or `Return`. Something must be caching or something. \r\n\r\n@astrojuanlu any ideas on the caching thing and my inability to get rid of a warning that is no longer true?

See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPartially fixes #1152\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThe PR will:\r\n\r\n- Switch from using the `napoleon` Sphinx extension for NumPy docstring parsing to `numpydoc`\r\n- Switch documentation theme to `pydata-sphinx-theme` used by pandas and others\r\n- Include updates to docstrings in numerous files to fix errors in NumPy docstring formatting (e.g. section labeled Return not Returns, ext). Note that I have to also pass pydocstyle checks for all files I touch!\r\n- Include updates to doc .rst files\r\n    - Includes changes to .rst files for API reference\r\n    - Changes to .rst files for new condensed layout on landing page and title bar\r\n- Update templates for classes so methods are shown (and reported in summary table + description below)\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nIt will create a dependency on the `pydata-sphinx-theme` package. It will also update the sphinx version. \r\n\r\nNote that it switches to using `numpydoc` to parse NumPy docstrings, but this was already in the doc requirements, we just had not enabled it in our `conf.py`. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1199/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-28T22:25:22Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T22:25:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1205","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1205/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1205/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1205/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/1205","id":952331905,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njk2NTQ2MTU0","number":1205,"title":"Update
