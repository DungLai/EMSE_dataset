Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nAs the issue points out, the x-axis labels don't match with the data points plotted. It turns out that mathplotlib recommends  [a different solution](https://matplotlib.org/examples/ticks_and_spines/tick_labels_from_values.html) for dynamically assigning tick labels from a list. I tweaked this code a bit to accommodate multiple series, which gives this result:\r\n\r\n```\r\ny = load_airline()\r\ny = y[:48]\r\nfh=np.arange(1, 13)\r\n\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=len(fh))\r\nplot_series(y_train, y_test, labels=[\"y_train\", \"y_test\"]);\r\nprint(y.shape, y_train.shape[0], y_test.shape[0])\r\nprint(y.index)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> (48,) 36 12\r\n> PeriodIndex(['1949-01', '1949-02', '1949-03', '1949-04', '1949-05', '1949-06',\r\n> '1949-07', '1949-08', '1949-09', '1949-10', '1949-11', '1949-12',\r\n> '1950-01', '1950-02', '1950-03', '1950-04', '1950-05', '1950-06',\r\n> '1950-07', '1950-08', '1950-09', '1950-10', '1950-11', '1950-12',\r\n> '1951-01', '1951-02', '1951-03', '1951-04', '1951-05', '1951-06',\r\n> '1951-07', '1951-08', '1951-09', '1951-10', '1951-11', '1951-12',\r\n> '1952-01', '1952-02', '1952-03', '1952-04', '1952-05', '1952-06',\r\n> '1952-07', '1952-08', '1952-09', '1952-10', '1952-11', '1952-12'],\r\n> dtype='period[M]', name='Period', freq='M')\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38268331/101943620-68e8ae00-3bb9-11eb-85f3-1232c0918d34.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo, I just imported some new functions from mathplotlib.ticker and mathplotlib.cbook.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\nI'm not too sure what parts of the PR checklist are relevant - feel free to let me

It seems that something is going wrong when importing the function from the conda install. This does not appear to be the case with a local import of the file or an inline paste of the code.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first is imported as `from sktime.utils.plotting  import plot_series` whereas the second (`plot_series_local`) is a local copy of the `plotting.py` file within the utils folder which has been placed within my project folder. The third (`plot_series_github`) is an inline paste of the same fine). All files are identical per verbatim. \r\n\r\n- very peculiar.  \r\n\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-15 at 16 37
