If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n* There is an open question about how to handle exogenous data (`X_test`) with incomplete forecasting horizons (e.g. `fh=[2, 5]`). Many models need the complete range of exogenous data, but it's not obvious how to best provide this. Should we always return the complete range and let forecasters and scoring methods pick what they need?\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4532609819,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDUzMjYwOTgxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4532609819","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-31T07:20:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
