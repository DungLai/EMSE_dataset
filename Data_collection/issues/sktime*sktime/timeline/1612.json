just noticed sth: if `X` is by default used, then `transformers_X` is not needed - we can just use the `ForecastingPipeline`.\r\nI.e., we could have lags in `X` via sth like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nforecaster = ForecastingPipeline(steps=[\r\n        (\"X_lags\", my_lagged_window_summarizer),\r\n        (\"lagged_reducer\", LaggedReducer(\r\n            regressor =

the transformers in the `LaggedReducer` behave as \"featureizers\".\r\nThis solves the \"empty input\" issue in the calendar features, since the input is `y`.\r\n\r\nThe \"lags in `X`\" are applied in the `ForecastingPipeline`, by

It is probably not great, but it's the user who should choose in the end...\r\n\r\n> Is there any way to provide `window_length` (lags) in the `ForecastingPipeline`?\r\n\r\nPartially answered above - the pipeline has no lags, you have to provide it in the transformer component which does the lagging, see examples above.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/968338983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5614567914,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc4-s6P6zwAAAAFOp4Hq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5614567914","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-14T18:11:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5614567917,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc4-s6P6zwAAAAFOp4Ht","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5614567917","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-14T18:11:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5614567919,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc4-s6P6zwAAAAFOp4Hv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5614567919","actor":{"login":"Dwarak-PCI","id":83296198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjk2MTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83296198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI","html_url":"https://github.com/Dwarak-PCI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-14T18:11:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5614567920,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc4-s6P6zwAAAAFOp4Hw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5614567920","actor":{"login":"Dwarak-PCI","id":83296198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjk2MTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83296198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url"
