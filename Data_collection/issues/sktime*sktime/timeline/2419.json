PR adds tests to test that tests conducted by the `check_estimator` utlity are passing, on three example estimators that are known to pass all tests in the full test suite.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that future tests catch unintentional side effects to changes in the test module that cause a `check_estimator` test to fail, such as the problem addressed recently in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2405\r\n\r\nAlso turns some instances of `pytest.skip` inside tests into `return None`, as that currently breaks `check_estimator`.
