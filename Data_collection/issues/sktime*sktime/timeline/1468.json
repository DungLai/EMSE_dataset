In effect, this PR adds more keys and values that are retrieved to the return of `get_fitted_params`, from crawling the fitted steps.\r\n\r\nFurther updates the `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator` with a relaxed interface assumption: the `_steps_attr` now only needs to be an iterable of tuples of which the 0-th element is the name, 1-st element is an estimator. This covers, for instance, the `ColumnEnsembleForecaster` and the `ColumnEnsembleClassifier` natively, for both `get_params` (existing feature) and the new `get_fitted_params` functionality.\r\n\r\nFYI @RNKuhns as this concerns an `skbase` object, would be keen to hear your opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
