loops.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1255737350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"topher-lo","id":46541035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46541035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/topher-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7444048655,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5Sb4kbzwAAAAG7sysP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7444048655","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-23T02:26:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7444048661,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5Sb4kbzwAAAAG7sysV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7444048661","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-23T02:26:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7444222233,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5Sb4kbzwAAAAG7tdEZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7444222233","actor":{"login":"jasmineliaw","id":93530957,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZMrTQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93530957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw","html_url":"https://github.com/jasmineliaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasmineliaw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-23T03:30:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7444222237,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5Sb4kbzwAAAAG7tdEd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7444222237","actor":{"login":"jasmineliaw","id":93530957,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZMrTQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93530957?v=4","grava

Write $r_h(t) := s(t) - \\widehat{s}_h(t)$ for the forecast residuals at horizon $h$.\r\n\r\nNote these are all residuals *at* a forecast horizon $h$. Often it is assumed (and let's do that for simplicity) that $r_h(t)$ is variance stationary, so $\\mbox{Var } r_h(t)$ does not depend on $t$, but it depends on $h$, so let's call this $\\sigma_h^2$.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have these residuals at time stamps $t\\in R$. The typical estimate for $\\sigma_h^2$ would be $\\frac{1}{ | R | \\cdot \\rho_h } \\sum_{t \\in R} (r_h(t) - \\bar{r}_h)^2$, where $\\bar{r}_h$ is the sample mean of the $r_h(t)$, ranging over $t\\in R$, and $\\rho_h$ is effective sample size correction coefficient of $r_h$ (this can be estimated in various ways).\r\n\r\nWhat is important is not how we compute $\\rho_h$ (there are different ways), but the sum we need to compute (which does not depend on $\\rho_h$).\r\n\r\nFor the naive forecaster, the sum would be computed from `y - y.shift(h)` for \"last value carry forward\" (in the non-seasonal case), and we get one $\\sigma_h^2$ per $h$ in the `sktime` forecasting horizon vector `fh`. Similar for rolling mean etc.\r\n\r\nWhich is not what the current code does: it does not loop over $h$-es, and it does not look at the right residuals.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1255862674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1255864184","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3469#issuecomment-1255864184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3469","id":1255864184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5K2vd4","user":{"login":"topher-lo","id":46541035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46541035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/topher-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-23T07:06:09Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T07:06:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fkiraly I just started a long writeup on this issue.
