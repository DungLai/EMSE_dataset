Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nReviewed and added missing statsmodel's parameters to non-constructor or fit functions\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nFour statsmodel-based files were reviewed/worked on. These are: \r\n\r\n* var.py - added `freq`, `dates` and `ic` parameters\r\n* trend.py - no change, all parameters matched with statsmodel\r\n* theta.py - no change needed\r\n* structural.py - no change needed\r\n* ets.py - no change needed\r\n\r\nRefer to docstrings in the constructors for their uses.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nIt does not introduce a new dependency\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nIn ets.py, `method` is called in the `super().fit()` method of class `ETSModel`.
