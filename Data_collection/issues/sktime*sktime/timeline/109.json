We also frequently extract cases from a dataframe to put them in, for example, a list for better processing where there are no rows. Also, for equivilancy between other machine learning packages on a semantic level, many implementations have no notions of tables, rows, columns, etc (e.g. Weka) so it would be better to keep it more conceptual in my opinion\r\n\r\n\r\n**Dimensionality**\r\n\r\nI again would agree with Tony (surprise surprise!) and vote for **dimensions** as that is transferable between different tools and interpretations when talking about multi-dimensional data BUT with the caveat that I've only ever used or cared about multidimensional data previously in the situation where all channels/columns/dimensions are time series. In sktime, perhaps columns is more general here for our implementation as we may want to store more complex data in the same container along with the time series, e.g. scaler columns for age, or name, and so on. With that in mind I'm not sold either way\r\n\r\n**Series length**\r\n\r\nI personally think **length** is fine here and am a bit weary of observation as the terminology. For example, if we want to pad data or interpolate to make unequal length -> equal length, then some of the values are not _observations_ in a sense. In those cases (in my mind at least) the series would be of the same length but not necessarily contain the same number of observations.

Some classifiers can be adapted to do regression, but that would be enhancing the capabilities of the classifier. In  regressors package I'd expect to see specific regression algorithms such as GLIM, GaussianProcesses etc. Its very hard to be consistent with MyThngClassifier. for example, what would you call CART?
