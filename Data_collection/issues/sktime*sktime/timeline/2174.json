PR is an attempt to address the doc build fails that @aiwalter had reported, i.e., empty/missing pages for estimators with soft dependencies. This was also reported earlier as #2013.\r\n\r\nThe way this is done is via a minor change to `_check_soft_dependencies`, which gets an additional argument `severity` that controls whether a warning is raised, or an exception.\r\nThe extended utility is then used as follows:\r\n* called on module import, but raises only a warning, so execution does not terminate\r\n* called additionally on class construction, with an exception.\r\n\r\nThat way, users as well as the doc build process can import classes, read docstrings, and will get an error only when the class is constructed. The informative error message is still raised at the earliest possible point in time.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue for (hopefully) all instances of `_check_soft_dependencies` preventing doc build previously.\r\nIt also contains changes to make the error message more informative.\r\n\r\nChanges still need to be made to dependent docs that outline how implementers/developer should deal with soft dependencies: the developer documentation, and the extension templates.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the following bug:\r\n* (T)BATS models behaving as a singleton, i.e., one call to `fit` overwrites all models in all instances,

it).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6191145525,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc5FL0zqzwAAAAFxBWI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6191145525","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-06T22:07:16Z","rename":{"from":"[BUG]
