@eenticott-shell, looks neat!\r\nI think the general ideas make all sense, I have some detail comments.\r\n\r\ncomments in general:\r\n* you didn't specify the format of `y_pred`. I assume that is the output of `predict_proba`? Or of `predict_quantiles`? You need to be more specific here. One or the other? Are there perhaps different kinds of metrics, depending on which input they take?\r\n* per design, the metric wouldn't call the estimator directly, but take an output. There are multiple options here, `predict_proba`, `predict_var`, `predict_interval`. How do we know which output the metric takes?\r\n* the pinball loss you have is for a single quantile prediction, but the output of `predict_quantiles` and `predict_interval` returns multiple quantiles. The usual loss here (see Gneiting paper) is the sum, or mean, over all quantiles appearing in the prediction.\r\n* further, there is a special multi-index format that `predict_quantiles` gives you if you have a multivariate forecast. How should the output of the metric look like in this case? I think there are two options, take the average over variables, or don't (keep multi-index). In `scikit-learn`, whether it's one or the other is controlled by the `multioutput` argument.\r\n\r\nFor the class:\r\n* most importantly: I'd put parameters like the `alpha` for the pinball loss in the constructor (object parameter). All methods, including `__call__`, should expose the same signature `(y_true, y_pred)`, in line with the base class pattern.\r\n* Style-wise I'd not put logic in `__call__` but have it call an `evaluate` method. In case we need checks etc, one might consider `evaluate`/`_evaluate` split (like `fit`/`_fit`), but that may be overkill.\r\n* often, it is very useful to have not just the aggregate score (over multiple test samples), but a per-sample function, i.e., if you have `n` test points, you get a vector of `n` loss values. This could be `evaluate_sample`. Not all metrics will have this (although you can always provide jackknife pseudo-samples).\r\n* tags make sense, good idea. Perhaps separate with colon, not with hyphen (to be in line with `capability` tags)\r\n* should `multioutput` be an arg of the init, or an arg of the call resp `evaluate`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/995801709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5778242214,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5Ab3-qzwAAAAFYaPqm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5778242214","actor":{"login":"eenticott-shell","id":93924843,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZkt6w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93924843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell","html_url":"https://github.com/eenticott-shell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T13:10:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5778242225,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5Ab3-qzwAAAAFYaPqx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5778242225","actor":{"login":"eenticott-shell","id":93924843,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZkt6w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93924843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell","html_url":"https://github.com/eenticott-shell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T13:10:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"eenticott-shell","id":93924843,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZkt6w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93924843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell","html_url":"https://github.com/eenticott-shell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eenticott-shell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-26T14:31:08Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T14:31:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1936","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1936/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https

Reference Issues/PRs\r\nAddresses #1763 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nA prototype of a new metric class designed for probabilistic or quantile inputs. The specific implementation is for the pinball loss.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThe overall structure of the class, public and private method specification, defaults and handling of input types. Some of this remains to be properly implemented. \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of
