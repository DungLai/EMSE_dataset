Since with the time series classification use case, `RandomizedSearchCV` should work without problems.\r\n\r\nCurrently, tuning methods for forecasting are still under development (and/or not available), since as you say you need temporal splits and you need to apply them to series.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you use a supervised learner to forecast, you can apply tabular re-sampling schemes from sklearn by using, say time series splits and `RandomizedSearchCV` *inside* the `ReducedRegressionForecaster` that reduces forecasting to supervised regression, i.e., your model specification code would look like \r\n`ReducedRegressionForecaster(RandomizedSearchCV(myFavouriteSupervisedLearner()))` plus parameter settings. The temporal re-sampling strategy would be an argument to `RandomizedSearchCV` in this composite.\r\n\r\nIf this is not wha you are looking for, would you mind explaining what you would like to do?
