PR makes minor changes to `ForecastingHorizon` construction behaviour, to address the user frustration highlighted by @Flix6x in #1167. It also fixes all the docstrings.\r\n\r\nPreviously, regarding `ForecastingHorizon` construction behaviour:\r\n* the default `is_relative` in construction of `ForecastingHorizon` was `True`, which caused an error to be thrown when constructing a `ForecastingHorizon` with supported absolute index types that were not also relative types, like `pd.DatetimeIndex`.\r\n* when an index of such a type was passed to the `fh` argument of `fit` or `predict`, the same error would be thrown, since all indices were converted to `ForeceastingHorizon` with the default setting `is_relative=True`.\r\n\r\nThe new construction behaviour is as follows:\r\n* the constructor allows the `is_relative` argument to be `None` - in this case the value of the `is_relative` argument is inferred: if the index is a supported relative index, it's `is_relative=True`. Otherwise, if it's a supported absolute index, it's `is_relative=False`.\r\n* This covers the case of `pd.DatetimeIndex`, which now can be passed to `fit` and `predict` without the estimator complaining.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5040402069,"node_id":"MDE0OkNvbm5lY3RlZEV2ZW50NTA0MDQwMjA2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5040402069","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-19T19:39:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/882809064","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1167#issuecomment-882809064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1167","id":882809064,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc40npjo","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-19T19:41:34Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T19:41:34Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I

am trying to follow the first example notebook but with my own dataset:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/01_forecasting.ipynb\r\n\r\nI have two pandas series, train and test that have the schema:\r\n\r\nindex of type: `pandas.core.indexes.datetimes.DatetimeIndex`\r\nseries of type: `int64`\r\n\r\nThe series in train covers `2013-08-01` daily through to `2014-06-30`\r\nThe series in test covers `2014-07-01` daily through to `2016-06-30`\r\n\r\nIn order to generate predictions, I see that I need to create a _ForecastingHorizon_\r\n\r\nso I create one as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(\r\n    pd.PeriodIndex(pd.date_range(test.index[0], \r\n                                 periods=len(ttest.index), \r\n                                 freq=\"D\")), is_relative=False\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nas it seems like I can't just enter in the index of the testset.\r\n\r\nI setup a _NaiveForecaster_ as described:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.naive import NaiveForecaster\r\n\r\nbasic_forecaster =  NaiveForecaster(strategy=\"last\")\r\nforecaster = NaiveForecaster(strategy=\"last\")\r\nforecaster.fit(train)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut when I enter in the forecasting horizon to produce my predictions:\r\n`forecaster.predict(fh)`\r\n\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call
