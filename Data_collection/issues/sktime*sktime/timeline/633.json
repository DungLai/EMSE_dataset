Thanks for getting back. The basic idea is to have a reference score across a realistic forecast window and multiple folds so that multiple models can be compared and stability of the algorithm can also be tested.

folds). \r\n\r\nUsing this information, the user (or the library itself) could provide some utilities to plot this such as the examples [shown

@fkiraly \r\n\r\n> First, are you proposing:\r\n\r\n> a tuning method (compositor)\r\n> an evaluation workflow?\r\n\r\nIf I understand your question correctly, I am not proposing anything different from what is already there in the flow today. Based on my understanding, the workflow for `ForecastingGridSearchCV` is doing both today - running the model for multiple hyperparameters (tuning) and then selecting the best set of hyperparameters based on the evaluation in the validation period. \r\n\r\nAll I am asking is if the forecast horizon can be extended to support a realistic horizon based on end user's forecast horizon instead of a \"one step ahead\" (or a single point) validation. If I try to put in a forecast horizon of 12 periods in the code, it gives an error that this is not supported yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Second, the devil is in the detail when you talk about error estimation using re-sample estimates - and it's easy to get confused too.\r\n\r\nMaybe the images complicated the discussion :). So let me rephrase \r\n\r\nLets say my forecast horizon is 12 periods (1 year with monthly data). So for fold 1, I will get 12 forecast values. This can be compared with the actual values for these 12 periods and sMAPE can be calculated for this fold (let's call this sMAPE_fold1).\r\n\r\nThe same process can then be repeated for all the folds. If there are 50 folds, then we will end up with 50 sMAPE values (sMAPE_fold1 to sMAPE_fold50).\r\n\r\nThe best hyperparameter selection can then be based on the average (or another statistic) value across these 50 values. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be nice to have the raw values available to the user for all 50 folds and for each candidate hyperparameter. These can be used by the user to do further analysis if needed (and make any plots that they want), so the plotting can be outside the scope of `sktime`).

@mloning @fkiraly @aiwalter @ngupta23\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm trying to migrate my codebase from `statsmodels` and `pmdarima` to `sktime`. There are some nuances that I have noticed:\r\n\r\n1. There is absolutely no difference between using `SlidingWindowSplitter` and `ExpandingWindowSplitter` when pass them to `ForecastingGridSearchCV`. New data is appended to `self._y` and `self._X` according to the selected splitter strategy (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/552#issuecomment-748685565, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/520#issuecomment-737325145), but: \r\n    - Training folds are still the same for both splitters.\r\n    - Training folds become larger and larger. It's OK for `ExpandingWindowSplitter`, but not for `SlidingWindowSplitter`. For `SlidingWindowSplitter`'s training folds should have the same length and move forward step by step and forget the earliest data points.\r\n\r\n2. I believe that `initial_window` and `start_with_window` parameters can be avoided in splitter classes to make them easier to understand (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/521, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/518). For example, I suggest the following signatures:\r\n    - `SlidingWindowSplitter(window_length, fh, step_length)`: fixed size training windows\r\n    - `ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_window_length, fh, step_length)`: expanding training windows\r\n\r\n    As you can see I was inspired by `pmdarima.model_selection`'s classes `SlidingWindowForecastCV` and `RollingForecastCV`.\r\n\r\n3. `ForecastingGridSearchCV` doesn't support a multi-step forecasting horizon (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/633).\r\n\r\n4. Also, it's good to add `cross_val_score` function in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection` that returns scores for each train/test folds. I found @aiwalter's evaluate function very similar to what I mean (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/657).\r\n\r\n5. The final suggestion is about update vs refit trade-off.\r\n    - For sliding window setting when the training fold has a fixed length there is only one option - call refit.\r\n    - For expanding window setting, from my point of view, the better approach is to use update functionality and refit as a fall-back option.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any of my suggestions sound interesting to you.
