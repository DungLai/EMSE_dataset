[adtk](https://adtk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) where we have operators for estimators (e.g. an aggregator).

for the pointers! A few questions:\r\n\r\n- The classes in `_update.py` don't seem to be covered by any tests, would it be worth it to add some?\r\n- Should `UpdateRefitsEvery` be refactored to use the new `ConditionalRefitForecaster` (or `ConditionalRefitter`)?\r\n- Should `ConditionalRefitForecaster` be public and usable by the users of just internal and used for subclassing? If it is the former we probably need some kind of API, maybe letting users pass in a few functions for 1) setting the state in `_fit`, 2) deciding whether to refit in `_update`, and 3) update the state before `_update` is finished? We'll need something similar if it's just internal as well, of course, but having this as a public API might be a bit too complex? Added #3144 so we can discuss the API design with something concrete.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1200247799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ZiyaoWei","id":940823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDgyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/940823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyaoWei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ZiyaoWei","id":940823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDgyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/940823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyaoWei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyaoWei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-30T20:54:45Z","updated_at":"2022-07-30T20:54:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3144","id":1323295289,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc48X43N","number":3144,"title":"[ENH]

These are generic tests ensuring interface conformance with `sklearn` and `sktime`. But, they do not test functionality specific to a forecaster.\r\n(to see which tests, run `check_estimator` on the estimator)\r\n\r\nSo, tests for interface conformance (e.g., output has the right type) would be redundant, but checking whether the models really update at the right time, or other tests specific to the forecasters, would be useful, e.g,. for refactor.\r\n\r\n> Should `UpdateRefitsEvery` be refactored to use the new `ConditionalRefitForecaster` (or `ConditionalRefitter`)?\r\n\r\nThat may be a good idea. Although I think there is a trade-off to strike between simplicity and uniformity. I'm very open for you to make suggestions.\r\n\r\nFrom a deprecation perspective, we need to keep `UpdateRefitsEvery` as a class with its current functionality, at least for a deprecation cycle. Personally, I would not want to remove it, since it is simple to understand.\r\n\r\n> Should `ConditionalRefitForecaster` be public and usable by the users of just internal and used for subclassing? If it is the former we probably need some kind of API, maybe letting users pass in a few functions for 1) setting the state in `_fit`, 2) deciding whether to refit in `_update`, and 3) update the state before `_update` is finished? We'll need something similar if it's just internal as well, of course, but having this as a public API might be a bit too complex? Added #3144 so we can discuss the API design with something concrete.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful with a public interface, although there may be a case for or against having a joint parent class.\r\n\r\nIf public, the condition would probably need to take the form of a function on the data? Or, some hard-coded conditions might also be useful (could be strings). Not entirely sure, keen to see your suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1200299347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
