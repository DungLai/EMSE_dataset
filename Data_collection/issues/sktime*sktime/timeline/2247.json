If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.

[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe forecasting test [`test_update_predict_predicted_index`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/df683766f4af7fd7fbe339fbf306d7a560827574/sktime/forecasting/tests/test_all_forecasters.py#L520) does the following:\r\n1. splits a time series y in `y_train` and `y_test`. \r\n2. fits a forecasting algorithm using `y_train`\r\n3. calls `update_predict` on the fitted forecaster using `y_test` and a `SlidingWindowSplitter`. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the test is that the first non-trivial update call uses data that are more than one time step ahead than the data passed in fit. As a result when we try to reconcile `y_train` and the subset of `y_test` from the splitter the resulting time series has gaps and frequency None. For some reason this was not causing any forecasting algorithm to break apart from `BaggingForecaster` in #2248 and in only 2 test cases ([see CI log](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/runs/6397105019?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:47103)).\r\n\r\nThe following code reproduces the behaviour of the test:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing.series import _make_series\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import (\r\n    SlidingWindowSplitter,\r\n    temporal_train_test_split,\r\n)\r\n\r\nn_columns = 1\r\nfh_int_oos = [2, 5]\r\nwindow_length = 1\r\nstep_length = 5\r\n\r\ny = _make_series(n_columns=n_columns, all_positive=True, index_type=\"datetime\")\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    fh_int_oos,\r\n    window_length=window_length,\r\n    step_length=step_length,\r\n    start_with_window=False,\r\n)\r\n\r\nprint(f\"max date seen during fit: {y_train.index.max()}\")\r\ncounter = 0\r\nfor train_idx, test_idx in cv.split(y_test):\r\n    print(f\"split {counter} min date seen during update: {y_test.iloc[train_idx].index.min()}\")\r\n    counter += 1\r\n\r\n# Prints:\r\n# max date seen during fit: 2000-02-06 00:00:00\r\n# split 0 min date seen during update: NaT\r\n# split 1 min date seen during update: 2000-02-11 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHaving a complete time series is a fair requirement from a forecasting algorithm, the test should reflect this.\r\nUsing the `ExpandingWindowSlicer` instead of the `SlidingWindowSplitter` will fix this.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNot implementing BaggingForecaster\r\n\r\n⚠️ **Disclaimer** ⚠️\r\nThere's a good chance that my conclusion that the test needs some changes is wrong and there's a valid reason for it being that way.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2700/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6925656148,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5F-X0UzwAAAAGczSBU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6925656148","actor":{"login":"ltsaprounis","id":64217214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE3MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64217214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis","html_url":"https://github.com/ltsaprounis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-04T07:44:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6925656237,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5F-X0UzwAAAAGczSCt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6925656237","actor":{"login":"ltsaprounis","id":64217214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE3MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64217214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis","html_url":"https://github.com/ltsaprounis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-04T07:44:53Z","project_card":{"id":79349952,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/79349952","project_id":2386754,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/2386754","column_name":"Done","previous_column_name":"To
