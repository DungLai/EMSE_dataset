the problem with that is that if people specify a different horizon in `_fit` for the forecasters that need the horizon, having a default in `_predict` which may be different from what was passed in `_fit` may lead to errors and more confusion. \r\n\r\nIf we just want to provide a default for the forecasters that do not require `fh` in `fit`, it needs to happen in `_set_fh` I think. Alternatively, we can set the default in `fit` for all forecasters, but then users may be confused if they want to pass it `predict`. This turns out to be a bit trickier than I thought

Inside `_set_fh` there is a decision tree which raises an error \"`fh` must have been passed\", and this is raised whenever the latest point is at which the `fh` must be passed, and if at that point the `fh` has not been passed.\r\n\r\nIf you set the default at the point where this error would be raised (which is what I am suggesting), then the behaviour that you describe would not occur. Because in the forecasters that do not require `fh` in `fit`, the default would only be set if no `fh` is passed in `predict`, at that very point, and not in `fit`.\r\n\r\nHappy to spell this out in
