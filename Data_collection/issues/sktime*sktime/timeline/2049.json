Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nIn this fix, I:\r\n- Removed all references of `pd.Int64Index` across all files.\r\n- Updated the tests so verify against `pd.Index` and `dtype=='int64'`.\r\n- Fixed all instantiations from `pd.Int64Index(...)` to `pd.Index(..., dtype='int64')`.\r\n \r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNA\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n- Whether the fix looks okay.\r\n- If there are any missing entries that should be changed.\r\n- If there are other places where the change affects the code-base.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n- There were two places where docstrings were missing because of which `pre-commit` was failing. I have added the docstrings as well. If it needs to be added in a separate PR, please let me know.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of
