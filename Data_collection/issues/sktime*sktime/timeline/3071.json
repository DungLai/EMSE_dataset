Actually, I wouldn't say this is a bug, but rather a badly documented feature. Test window will include only those observations that are explicitly listed in the forecasting horizon. The desired result is achieved by providing `np.arange(1, 6)` to the `fh` argument:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import SlidingWindowSplitter, ExpandingWindowSplitter\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(list(range(0, 50)))\r\n\r\nsliding_splitter = SlidingWindowSplitter(fh=np.arange(1, 6), window_length=10, step_length=1)\r\ns = list(sliding_splitter.split(df))\r\nprint(f\"First split of SlidingWindowSplitter: {s[0]}\")\r\n\r\nexpanding_splitter = ExpandingWindowSplitter(fh=np.arange(1, 6), initial_window=5, step_length=2)\r\nss = list(expanding_splitter.split(df))\r\nprint(f\"First split of ExpandingWindowSplitter: {ss[0]}\")\r\n```\r\nI will try to add a few lines to the docstring of the splitters in the coming days. I hope this would be sufficient. Changing splitters behaviour to expand test window up to the maximum forecasting horizon is less explicit and therefore not a very good idea.

think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1192349426/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7044873692,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5OU-eVzwAAAAGj6D3c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7044873692","actor":{"login":"e-alizadeh","id":30320825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzIwODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30320825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/e-alizadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T09:02:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7044873699,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5OU-eVzwAAAAGj6D3j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7044873699","actor":{"login":"e-alizadeh","id":30320825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzIwODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30320825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/e-alizadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e-alizadeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T09:02:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1192384458","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3071#issuecomment-1192384458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3071","id":1192384458,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HElfK","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T09:41:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T09:41:21Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Possible

when exogenous variables are present. A fix is proposed above (basically `splits()` should return the test indices for all future values including gaps in the Forecast Horizon).\r\n\r\nOne thing to note would be to have another method that only returns the points in the Forecast Horizon only (essentially what `splits()` does currently) as this would be useful for creating visualizations for the cross-validation as [shown here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/v0.11.3/examples/window_splitters.ipynb).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.7.13 (default, Apr 24 2022, 01:04:09)  [GCC 7.5.0]\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\r\n   machine: Linux-5.4.188+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 21.1.3\r\n   setuptools: 57.4.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.2\r\n       sktime: 0.11.3\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.21.6\r\n        scipy: 1.4.1\r\n       pandas: 1.3.5\r\n   matplotlib: 3.2.2\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.1\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.5\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7098615927,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5OU-eVzwAAAAGnHEh3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7098615927","actor":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-01T06:57:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
