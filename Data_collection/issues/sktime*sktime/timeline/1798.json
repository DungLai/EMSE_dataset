One could now argue whether the \"more methods\" in the extender contract make it easier to understand, or more complex to comply with. I'd be on the side that, in the balance of things, it makes it easire and more intuitive to extend, but I see why one could be of the opposite opinion.\r\n* we're doing it differently from `sklearn`, effectively committing heresy.

a pair programming session with @lbventur (at the community meetup).\r\n\r\nThis PR solves #2478, it upgrades `Differencer` with NA handling parameter `na_handling`, which allows, besides the two current behaviours, a third behaviour `fill_zero` that fills zero.\r\n\r\nThis parameter replaces the boolean `drop_na` parameter, and adds deprecation with replacement at 0.13.0, and move to a `fill_zero` default.\r\n\r\nWhy is the `fill_zero` parameter a better default? It results in a \"same index\" and \"no NA\" condition at the end, which is the most compatible out of the alternatives when used in a pipeline.

need to have a design decision on conflicting elements of our current interface specification.\r\n\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\n1. `__init__` should contain no logic for input checking, and optimally no other logic. Such logic should be placed at the start of `_fit`\r\n2. dynamic tags need to be set in the `__init__`, since tags are read at the start of the `fit` call which precedes the `_fit` call\r\n3. we have the `fit_is_empty` tag, which can mean that `_fit` is never called for a given estimator, as well as estimators/object types that have no `fit` (such as distances)\r\n\r\nHere, 1. conflucts with 2. and with 3., but 2. and 3. do not conflict with each other (I think).\r\n\r\nI feel we need to think about potential ways to resolve this situation.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1798","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
