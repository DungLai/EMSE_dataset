PR introduces a pipeline object for time series classification where the last object is an `sklearn` classifier.\r\n\r\nDifferently from current pipeline constructs involving sklearn classifiers, this (a) inherits from `BaseClassifier` and hence also performs all the input checks and conversions, or can be used in further composition, and (b) also allows for both series-to-primitives and series-to-series transformers to be chained.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the tests are still failing due to use of `SummaryTransformer` as series-to-primitives, and its issue with output signature in case of a

PR adds tests for series-to-primitives output in `test_fit_transform_output`, and ensures the `SummaryTransformer` is compliant with that output.\r\nThis fixes #2717.\r\n\r\nFurther changes:\r\n* functionality of flattening hierarchical column indices, which is now used in two estimators, is moved to the `sktime.utils` module. This hence affects `FeatureUnion` through refactoring of the common functionality.\r\n* the type check for `Table` is modified to return a `n_instances` (number of rows/instances) metadata field, for all `Table` mtypes. This is used in the return type check, e.g., to check that `SummaryTransformer.fit_transform` returns the correct number of rows for multivariate input.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6749240458,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5KngVQzwAAAAGSSTyK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6749240458","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-05T21:00:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6749240495,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5KngVQzwAAAAGSSTyv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6749240495","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a761368f32b12913f2d7c22d87776e6112cc785d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/a761368f32b12913f2d7c22d87776e6112cc785d","created_at":"2022-06-05T21:00:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
