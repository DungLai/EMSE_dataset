The question that comes here is which index has the first prediction e.g. when doing `model.predict(1)`. From my understanding, this has index 1 and not 0? So just did `pred.index = pd.RangeIndex(start=pred.index.start + 1, stop = pred.index.stop + 1)\r\n`. Is this ok for you?\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Question 2:**\r\nI haave seen that when I do e.g. `model.predict(5)`, the fh is set to `ForecastingHorizon([5], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)` automatically. Is this a design pupose? As a user I would expect to get all 5 steps predicted, so `fh` could be set to `ForecastingHorizon([1,2,3,4,5], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)` instead. What do you think?\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Question 3:**\r\nThis PR yet contains only BATS. To add TBATS there are two options. Both, BATS and TBATS have the same args and fit/predict function. Options:\r\n1. Adding an arg like `type=BATS` \r\n2. Creating a new file `tbats.py` and inherit from `bats.py`. This is my preffered option :) Because then the user will not have to deal with a new arg that is unknown from original `tbats` packe interface.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/527/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/748580377","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/342#issuecomment-748580377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/342","id":748580377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODU4MDM3Nw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-20T08:50:58Z","updated_at":"2020-12-20T08:50:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closed
