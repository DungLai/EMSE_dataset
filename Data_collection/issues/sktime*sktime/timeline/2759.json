the community meetup today @aiwalter and @indinewton suggested it would be useful to create this issue to discuss the implementation of a  `MultiplexTransformer`.  After getting a chance to check out `OptionalPassthrough` I think we might not need build this thing at all (I agree it could be a bad idea to have multiple areas of the code base with such overlapping/similar functionality).  But - it did leave me with some questions/ideas about some potential use cases that might be worth expanding the current model to support: \r\n\r\n#### Some Background:\r\n\r\n- The original idea  to make a `MultiplexTransformer` came from a suggestion in #2459 that it would be nice to create a `MultiplexTransformer` to complement the `MultiplexForecaster`.\r\n- As of #2612 we have implemented a `_DelegatedTransformer` to facilitate implementation of `MultiplexTransformer` in a similar way to how `MultiplexForecaster` has been written. \r\n- As was mentioned in the community meeting however - it seems like the `OptionalPassthrough` transformer can already do most of what we would want to do with the `MultiplexTransformer` though performing a grid search over its `passthrough` variable.  (A solution which I was not aware of, thank you for bringing it up!)\r\n\r\n#### Some remaining questions/ideas I had:\r\n\r\n-  **Question 1 - What if we want to use exactly 1 Transformer from a list of `n` transformers?**.  It seems to me with the current system if we did something like this (borrowed from the docstring example for `OptionalPassthrough`):\r\n\r\n```\r\npipe = TransformedTargetForecaster(steps=[\r\n    (\"deseasonalizer\", OptionalPassthrough(Deseasonalizer())),\r\n    (\"scaler\", OptionalPassthrough(TabularToSeriesAdaptor(StandardScaler()))),\r\n    (\"forecaster\", NaiveForecaster())])\r\n# putting it all together in a grid search\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    initial_window=60,\r\n    window_length=24,\r\n    start_with_window=True,\r\n    step_length=48)\r\nparam_grid = {\r\n    \"deseasonalizer__passthrough\" : [True, False],\r\n    \"scaler__transformer__transformer__with_mean\": [True, False],\r\n    \"scaler__passthrough\" : [True, False],\r\n    \"forecaster__strategy\": [\"drift\", \"mean\", \"last\"]}\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(\r\n    forecaster=pipe,\r\n    param_grid=param_grid,\r\n    cv=cv,\r\n    n_jobs=-1)\r\ngscv_fitted = gscv.fit(load_airline())\r\n```\r\nThen we could actually end up with a situation where we either skip both `deseasonalizer` and `scaler` or include them both.  One might imagine it *could* be nice in some situations to specify that we want exactly one transformer from a list of transformers. Having a `MultiplexTransformer` is one way to achieve this (I didn't see a good way to do this with the current system), though I imagine it could also be supported by making some modifications to `param_grid` (ie could we specify pairs of variables simultaneously).  Personally I like the second idea, but I am not sure that it is the \"best solution\"\r\n\r\n- **Question 2: What is the best way to support \"multiplexing\" over pairs of transformers/forecasters simultaneously?**  (eg, maybe some transformations are needed for certain forecasters).  The way that springs to mind would be to create a separate `ForecastingPipeline` or a `TransformedTargetForecaster` for each pair, and then put all the pairs into a `MultiplexForecaster`?   Would it be worth building a cleaner work around? (a similar question/solution springs to mind in the case where we had a list of known transformations to use but we wanted to select the optimal ordering ie `trans_a` -> `trans_b` vs `trans_b` -> `trans_a`) \r\n \r\n\r\n#### What should be resolved:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Identify any meaningful use cases that either a) something like a `MultiplexTransformer` could uniquely support or b) that are worth expanding the current `OptionalPassthrough` approach to support as well?\r\n- [ ] Should we clean up (ie delete) the `DelegatedTransformer` code if we don't need it? \r\n\r\nLastly - I wonder if there is some way we can more easily inform people of the existence of `OptionalPassthrough`?  (Clearly people know about it!!  But I had missed it (which may of course just be on me)!  Thoughts on a Documentation page which has all the various Pipeline/model selection components? (and related dunders?))
