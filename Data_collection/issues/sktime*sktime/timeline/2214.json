your feature request related to a problem?

Use a.any() or a.all()\r\n# Expected Output: True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need to add an additional `if` block for `ForecastingHorizon` equality, similar to `numpy.ndarray`, `pandas.Series` etc. \r\ne.g. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/6cc0d41e778f9ed61a5cd8b24a21be680e23dd6f/sktime/utils/_testing/deep_equals.py#L108\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOne alternative fix would be changing `__eq__` in `ForecastingHorizon`. \r\nThis feels a bit more risky.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nDiscovered this while writing the tests for #2197.\r\nRelated to #2214.

It works for relative values but that seems to be just a coincidence where Pandas decides that relative `ForecastingHorizon`s looks like arrays so just does an array comparison.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I'm
