related to #1884.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good idea to extend `ScipyDist` with an optional parameter `weights` (1D iterable of float) which multiples the i-th column of `X`, `X2` with the i-the element in `weights` before applying the distance. If weights are passed, there should be a check in `_transform` for `weights` having length equal to number of columns of `X`, `X2`.\r\n\r\nNote: this should be done manually in `sktime`, since weighting is deprecated in `scipy`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1887/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1014904995","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1884#issuecomment-1014904995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1884","id":1014904995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc48fjij","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-17T21:40:12Z","updated_at":"2022-01-17T21:45:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I've opened three issues, #1886, #1887, and #1888.\r\n\r\nIf #1887 is done, you could use the weighted `ScipyDist` inside `AlignerDTW` inside `DistFromAligner` to get a DTW distance based on weighted variables, that's option 1. Alternatively, you can simply use your own distance function already, in `AlignerDTW`, in `DistFromAligner`.\r\n\r\nWith #1886 or #1888, you could specify a weight mixture of DTW
