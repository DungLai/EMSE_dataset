your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nSome forecasting performance metrics require `y_train`, e.g. [MASE](https://robjhyndman.com/papers/mase.pdf). This adds some complication to higher-level functionality that expects a common interface for metrics, like the `evaluate` function or `ForecastingGridSearchCV`, and in unit testing (see #672).\r\n\r\n**Current problem**\r\nThis currently fails because `y_train` is not passed internally when calling `scoring`. \r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.all import *\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_evaluation import evaluate\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nf = NaiveForecaster()\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter()\r\nscoring = MASE()\r\nout = evaluate(f, cv, y, scoring=scoring)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Possible solutions**\r\n1. Change interface for all performance metrics to optionally accept `y_train`, but only those that require it use it. This requires wrapping metrics from scikit-learn.  \r\n2. Add case distinctions in higher-level functionality to separately handle those metrics that require `y_train` and those that do not. This requires adding a `requires_y_train` attribute to metric classes.\r\n3. Adapt metrics interface at run time to, making case distinctions inside adapter, exposing uniform interface to higher-order functionality (suggested by @fkiraly). This also requires adding a `requires_y_train` attribute to metric classes.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.all import *\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_evaluation import evaluate\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nfh = np.arange(1, 10)\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, fh=fh)\r\nf = NaiveForecaster()\r\nf.fit(y_train)\r\ny_pred = f.predict(fh)\r\n\r\n# uniform interface\r\nscoring = MASE()\r\nscoring.requires_y_train = True\r\nscoring = check_scoring(scoring)\r\nscoring(y_test, y_pred, y_train)\r\n>>> 3.577770878609128\r\n\r\nscoring = sMAPE()\r\nscoring.requires_y_train = False\r\nscoring = check_scoring(scoring)\r\nscoring(y_test, y_pred, y_train)\r\n>>> 0.1780237534499896\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a rough implementation of the adapter-based solution:\r\n```python\r\nclass _MetricAdapter:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Adapter for performance metrics to uniformly handle \r\n    y_train requirement of some metrics.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, metric):\r\n        #
