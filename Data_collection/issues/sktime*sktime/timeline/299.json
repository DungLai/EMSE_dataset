tried to write this function but ran into an issue. Here's the replication code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.utils.data_container import from_nested_to_long\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing import generate_df_from_array, _assert_almost_equal\r\n\r\n# Create a nested array\r\nn_obs_X = 20\r\nn_cols_X = 3\r\nX = generate_df_from_array(np.random.normal(size=n_obs_X), n_rows=10,n_cols=n_cols_X)\r\n\r\n# Turn it into long format\r\nY = from_nested_to_long(X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue that I face is that the index dtype does not match for X and Y. That is:\r\n\r\n`X.iloc[0,0].index.dtype` => `dtype('int64')`\r\n\r\n`Y.time_index.dtype` => `dtype('O')`\r\n\r\nI use the following script to convert `Y` back to nested format:\r\n```python\r\ndef squish(y):\r\n    x=pd.pivot(y, index=\"time_index\", columns=\"column\", values=\"value\").sort_index()\r\n    x.index.name = None\r\n    d = pd.Series({idx: x.loc[:,idx] for idx in x.columns})\r\n    return d\r\n\r\nX_renest = Y.groupby([\"index\"]).apply(lambda x: squish(x))\r\n\r\nX_renest.iloc[0,0].index.dtype\r\n# dtype('O')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if this dtype change is expected out of `from_nested_to_long`. \r\n\r\nAdditional side effects I noticed:\r\n`type(Y.time_index.iloc[0])` => `str`\r\n`Y.index.is_unique` => `False`\r\n\r\nThe time index in X is a `RangeIndex` dtype. When we convert to long format, we lose the dtype information from X. Since RangeIndex is an object dtype, the conversion to long gets the correct time values but converts it into a string object. We can turn the string object to an int, but not sure how one could ensure exact replication from long to nested\r\n\r\nSince we start with 3 nested columns in X, Y get 3 duplicate index values (20 time points * 10 rows).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/647007709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hamzahiqb","id":10302415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzAyNDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10302415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb","html_url":"https://github.com/hamzahiqb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamzahiqb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/647025643","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/299#issuecomment-647025643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/299","id":647025643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzAyNTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-20T17:42:40Z","updated_at":"2020-06-20T17:42:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sorry, I don't fully understand what you mean. \r\n\r\n* I think the index dtype shouldn't change when going from one format to another.
