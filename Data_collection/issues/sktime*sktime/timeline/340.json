I found this old issue while looking for alignment & kernel related content.\r\n\r\nYour contribution could be quite timely if you are interested to get back to this now!\r\n\r\nIt took a while, but we now have:\r\n* base class and extension template for distances/kernels\r\n* base class and extension template for aligners, e.g., GA or dtw\r\n\r\nFor extension templates, see the `extension_templates` folder in the root dir.\r\n\r\nYou can find details in [STEP 10](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/10_alignment_warping_knn/step.md) of how things fit together.\r\n\r\nAn implementation or interface for the GA kernel as a kernel/distance, and/or an aligner would be greatly appreciated.\r\nAny other sequence kernels and aligners too!\r\n\r\nWhat would also be appreciated is an implementation of PCA that takes as component a kernel/distance following the new base class. This might be a little challenge, since we don't have a base class for unsupervised algorithms other than clustering currently, but you could take the clustering template.\r\n\r\nFeel free to join us on slack or discord to coordinate.\r\nWe also have regular community collaboration sessions on Friday (1pm UTC, discord) if you would like an intro to contributing.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/968342451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5614592565,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc4nJn7bzwAAAAFOp-I1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5614592565","actor":{"login":"techtide","id":8594707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTQ3MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8594707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide","html_url":"https://github.com/techtide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-14T18:38:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5614592566,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc4nJn7bzwAAAAFOp-I2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5614592566","actor":{"login":"techtide","id":8594707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTQ3MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8594707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide","html_url":"https://github.com/techtide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtide/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-14T18:38:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5614599039,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc4nJn7bzwAAAAFOp_t_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5614599039","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-14T18:46:09Z","label":{"name":"module:distances","color":"FD4F8F"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
