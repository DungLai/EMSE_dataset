sktime community has matured over the last years, and is now counting low-level active members in the hundreds, core contributors in the dozens, and passive members in the thousands.\r\nMembers of the community also administer resource in the order of a 100.000s - million GBP, on behalf of sktime.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this must be accompanied by a code of conduct that also comments explicitly on the management of resources, accountability, and balance of powers between decision makers and less influential community members.\r\n\r\nI have therefore made some suggestions on how to update the code of conduct.\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n* replace me, as a person, by the sktime code of conduct committee or community council (as appropriate by function), throughout the document. This is a change that should have been made a while ago, but apparently did not propagate from the governance document to the CoC.\r\n* introducese additional ideals: creation of fair opportunities for all, and free speech, while commenting trade-off cases. Why: fair opportunities refers to how resources are distributed - they must be distributed fairly and without discrimination. Free speech is important so the community can criticize and question decision making without leaders invoking \"discomfort\" to silence moments of accountability.\r\n\r\nMinor/secondary changes:\r\n* factors out the list mentioned as part of a sentence into a paragraph of \"protected characteristics\" which are then referred to in multiple locations.\r\n* adds some common characteristics to the list that I think just were unintentionally missing, e.g., national origin.\r\n* removes \"technical choices\" from protected characteristics. I don't think that's a protected characteristic.\r\n* adds explicit examples of unacceptable behaviour around resource allocation, aimed at community leaders who make decisions about money and resource. Also adds guidance on how the CoC is to be applied in such cases.\r\n* adds NumFOCUS as alternative entry point","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1295158775","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3664#issuecomment-1295158775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3664","id":1295158775,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5NMo33","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-28T15:48:00Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T15:48:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@miraep8  on #3095:\r\n\r\n> From a technical perspective I agree the best way to do it could be to have a shared mailing list (gmail based) that is for the CoC committee.
