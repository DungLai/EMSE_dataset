Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with [this issue ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2702), a function called `get_slice` has been created [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2706) so slicing objects is always inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAs in `get_window` ([link](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/a761368f32b12913f2d7c22d87776e6112cc785d/sktime/datatypes/_utilities.py#L222)) we need to add some additional conditional logic to deal with multi-index and hierarchical data structures. \r\n\r\nWe should also expand the tests in [datatypes/tests/test_utils.py](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/datatypes/tests/test_utils.py) to cover these cases.
