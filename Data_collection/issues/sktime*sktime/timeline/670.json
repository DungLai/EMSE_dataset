did not have time to look into this yet... \r\n\r\nFor now, let me just share with you a temporary patch that I have used in the past.

The default is `\"T\"` (minute) but it doesn't matter what frequency you use since the only thing that matters for the sktime internals is that freq is unitary. This transformer can be used as the first step in a pipeline. The end results will then be transformed back to the original freq. **Unfortunately, this approach only works when using relative forecasting horizons.**

while using a dataset that has a datetime index with a frequency of 10T (separated by 10 minutes), the ForecastingHorizon is setting the relative values to increments of 100. This leads to `n_periods` being set as 100 times the actual length `X.shape[0]` of the exogenous variable used in `predict`. This causes a `ValueError` to be raised by the Arima package `X array dims (n_rows) != n_periods`.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Download the dataset `energy_data.csv` from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00374/).\r\n2. Set the index as `date`.\r\n3. Separate X and y.\r\n4. Set `dates` as the index of `X` convert as a `datetime`.\r\n5. Convert `dates` to PeriodIndex with the appropriate frequency.\r\n6. Initialize `ForecastingHorizon`, followed by fitting and predicting with `AutoArima`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../energydata_complete.csv\")\r\ndata = data[:200]\r\ndata.set_index(\"date\", drop=True, inplace=True)\r\nX = data.copy()\r\ny = X.pop(\"Appliances\")\r\n\r\ndates = pd.to_datetime(X.index)\r\nfreq = pd.infer_freq(dates)\r\ndates = dates.to_period(freq=freq)\r\n\r\nX.index = dates\r\ny.index = dates\r\n\r\nfh_ = ForecastingHorizon(y.index[150:200], is_relative=False)\r\n\r\na_clf = sktime_arima.AutoARIMA(start_p=2, start_q=2, max_p=5, max_q=5)\r\nclf = a_clf.fit(X=X[:150], y=y[:150])\r\ny_pred_sk = clf.predict(fh=fh_, X=X[150:200])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that `n_periods = int(fh.to_relative(self.cutoff)[-1])` would set `n_periods` to 50 as there are 50 increments of datetime instances separated by 10 minutes being passed to `predict`. However `fh.to_relative(self.cutoff)` ends up producing this:\r\n\r\n`Int64Index([ 100,  200,  300,  400,  500,  600,  700,  800,  900, 1000, 1100,\r\n            1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700,

the bug**\r\n\r\nI happen to have a time series with a frequency of 30 minutes. Attempting to use this during forecasting triggers a `KeyError` in pandas.\r\n\r\nThis is because the datetime module assumes that the frequency is always 1 of some unit, ie `(1, freq)`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/4be4866ac50f0c6ce422716d529e95bfbf25411d/sktime/utils/datetime.py#L41-L44\r\n\r\nHowever, the frequency in my case in `30T`, which is called as `pd.Timedelta(1, \"30T\")`, which triggers the `KeyError`. Instead, The expected call is `pd.Timedelta(30, \"T\")`.\r\n\r\nThe `freqstr` returned by pandas seems to be parsed into a compact one-letter representation. At least, when I manually specified a frequency of `30mins`, reading the frequency returned `30T`. If this is generally true, then a `freqstr` of length > 1 implies that `freqstr[:-1]` hold the number of actual units.\r\n\r\nHowever, a cleaner solution might be to fix this in `_get_freq`:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/4be4866ac50f0c6ce422716d529e95bfbf25411d/sktime/utils/datetime.py#L53-L58\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy
