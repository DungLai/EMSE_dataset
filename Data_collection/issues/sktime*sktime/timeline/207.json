\"why would anyone use this library\": from a philosophical perspective, you should only board a train to Liverpool if you want to go to Liverpool. Less metaphorically, one should use sktime exactly when one finds at least one of its unique features useful (and useable).\r\n\r\nML/AI toolboxes such as sklearn (or sktime) provide more than just a bunch of standards (which is already useful btw!). The most important kinds of features are:\r\n- uniform interface to methods of the same kind (same statistical learning task)\r\n- method composition functionality, e.g., pipelines, composites, reduction\r\n- meta-methodology to fairly evaluate and compare competing methods - how do you know the expensive neural network outperforms ARIMA (or not?)\r\n\r\nTo go back to one of my favourite metaphors, a train is more than just an amalgamation of industry standards for wheels, coal burners, pipes, and other individual mechanical parts.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there's more to time series than forecasting (e.g., time series classification, segmentation, other annotation, panel models), so the picture for time series related learnin tasks is especially interesting. Distinguishing of the different learning tasks, and reduction methodology is an interesting research feature of this area.\r\n\r\nAlso see our recent paper\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07872\r\nfor more explanation.
