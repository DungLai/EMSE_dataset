Does this work?\r\n\r\nAs shown in the sample code, the error raised when you try to pass `fh=y.index` to get in-sample forecasts for all observations, which are usually unexpected for the user, because  the **optimal** ARIMA model found by `AutoARIMA()` may have `d=0 or 1 or 2 ...`. Thus, if user want to get all in-sample forecasts, they would pass `fh=y.index`, and this error would raise.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/873609228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AngelPone","id":32930283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTMwMjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32930283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone","html_url":"https://github.com/AngelPone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelPone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-04T18:50:04Z","updated_at":"2021-07-04T18:50:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1076","id":932304990,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MzIzMDQ5OTA=","number":1076,"title":"Forecasters
