Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1371\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR wraps the [UnobservedComponents](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.structural.UnobservedComponents.html) from statsmodels. We follow closely the existing implementation [sktime/forecasting/ets.py](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/ets.py) using the [` _StatsModelsAdapter`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_statsmodels.py) class (a minor change was added in order to support `exog` variables).\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nIn this initial PR I provide a basic implementation of the wrapper. Still, I wanna make sure I understand what are the requirements the code needs in order to merge to `main`. Concretely here are my questions:\r\n\r\n**Main Questions:**\r\n\r\n- The docstrings of the original statsmodels class [UnobservedComponents](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.structural.UnobservedComponents.html) is very complete and gives a clear description of the model and the `level` variable which determines the structure of the state space model. How much should I add to the doctrings on the `sktime` implementation?\r\n\r\n- Which kind of  test should I write? Probably a couple of test ensuring the statsmodels implementation agrees with this one.\r\n\r\n- Should I add this model to the [`examples/01_forecasting.ipynb`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/01_forecasting.ipynb) notebook? Any other place where I should add more examples on this new estimator?\r\n\r\n- Any other feedback or suggestion?\r\n\r\n**Minor Questions**\r\n\r\n- I wanted to add some useful plotting functions to this wrapper. Unfortunately the simple method `plot_components` fils because a `TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'Period'`. Have you encounter this type of error in the past? It seems the internal plotting functions do not handle `Period` types.\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added complete doc-strings.\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1394/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5319107845,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc46vkT8zwAAAAE9CyUF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5319107845","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-17T12:37:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
