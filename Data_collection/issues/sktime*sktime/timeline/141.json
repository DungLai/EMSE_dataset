was working with the [Orchestrator module](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/autogen/sktime.experiments.orchestrator.html) and I've noticed that the method `run()` needs list of datasets that has the `load()` method implemented. As you can see in the snippet below:\r\n\r\n```    \r\ndef run(self, predict_on_runtime=True, save_strategies=True):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Method for running the orchestrator\r\n        \r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        predict_on_runtime : bool, optional (default=True)\r\n            If True makes predictions after the estimator is trained\r\n        save_strategies : bool, optional (default=True)\r\n            If True saves the trained strategies on the disk\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n\r\n        for task, data in zip(self._tasks, self._datasets):\r\n            dts_loaded = data.load()\r\n```\r\nBut on the documentation we assume that is a list of `DataFrame` pandas. Which doesn't have the `load()` method ([DataFrame documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)). What is being used is a `DatasetHDD` list.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7353520/66721744-07be2280-eddc-11e9-95f8-71ee3d07736e.png)\r\nMinor issue: typo on `skitme`->`sktime`.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n**1. Easiest Solution**\r\nChange the documentation. \r\n`datasets (pandas dataframe) – datasets in pandas skitme format` -> `datasets (list of DatasetHDD) – datasets in DatasetHDD format`\r\n\r\n**2. Accept a DataFrame pandas as parameter to create a DatasetHDD**\r\n\r\n**3. Create a method that converts DataFrame pandas to DatasetHDD**\r\n\r\n**4. Create a .ts file from DataFrame pandas**\r\nI haven't found this option on the code base. I mean, even if this exists, it should be easily to find on the documentation, we should have an update on the [loading data tutorial](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/examples/loading_data.html) if that's the case. If we don't have a `create_tsfile_from_dataframe()`, this can solve the problem creating the tsfile and using it as parameter to the `DatasetHDD`. \r\n\r\n**5. DatasetRAM should be analogous to DatasetHDD**\r\nThe `load()` method on both classes are different. `DatasetHDD` splits the dataset, though the `DatasetRAM` doesn't. Maybe we could create a `Dataset` class and make that the parent class for both `DatasetRAM` and `DatasetHDD`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?
