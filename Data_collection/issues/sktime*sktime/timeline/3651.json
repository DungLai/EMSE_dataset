like an useful feature!\r\nSimilar to functionality in estimators, e.g., `ConformalIntervals`, that allow you to pass a sampling frequency rather than an absolute number.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend:\r\n* check how `sklearn` does it, esp for the temporal splitters, and possibly try to be consistent\r\n* spell out how the different sets of arguments would interact, since we have two potentially contradicting sets of arguments now\r\n\r\nWe may also want to fix #2678 first, to avoid complexity in combinations of potentially mutually contradictory arguments being
