Also, how are we going to handle the various parameters that are specific to the simulation interfaces?\r\n\r\nWe'll treat it in the same way as `predict` and `predict_quantiles`! \r\nFor example, I think `n_simulations` should be passed in the method and not as a class attribute in `__init__`. \r\nOther parameters that are specific to an estimator and will just add noise in the signature of the public method for others should go in the constructor. I also think the inevitable parameter `n_jobs` should also be passed as a class attribute.\r\n\r\n> One more question: is there a sensible default? E.g., sampling from `predict_var` s.t. normal sampling?\r\n\r\nThe **sensible default** is to sample recursively from the `predict_proba` distribution for the 1 step horizon. \r\nThere's some details around what you keep fixed and when to refit. In particular, I'm not sure how this automatic model selection type of forecasters deal with this e.g. does auto.arima keep the p, d, q fixed and refits the parameters, or does it go through model selection again to find new optimal p, d, q after the recursive update, or does it not even refit the parameters.
