interact with how we implement or formalise annotator scitypes?

Reference Issues/PRs\r\nAimed at addressing [Forecasting Pipelining enhancement proposal.](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/01_forecasting_api/forecasting-with-exogenous-variables.md#forecasting-pipelining)\r\n\r\nThis is also with reference to Issue #763 and Issue #844.\r\n\r\n### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a draft PR proposing a design for a more flexible \"network\" pipeline. The general idea of this network pipeline is that the steps comprising the pipeline are not chained, i.e. the output of a step is not necessarily the input for the next step. Instead, the output of any step can serve as input to any other step in the pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe steps of the pipeline are specified as tuple following the convention below:\r\n```python\r\n('step_name', Algorithm, arguments)\r\n```\r\n`step_name` is a string with the name of the step\r\n`Algorithm` can be `sktime.transformations.base.BaseTransformer` or `sktime.base.BaseEstimator`.\r\n`arguments` is a dictionary that is substituted in the `fit`, `fit_transform` or `predict` method of the step.\r\n\r\nThe `arguments` dictionary can use the following key words: `original_X` and `original_y` which refer to the `X` and `y` arguments of  `NetworkPipeline.fit` and `NetworkPipeline.predcit` methods.\r\n\r\nThe `arguments` dictionary can refer to the output of any step of the pipeline by the name of the step.\r\n\r\nThe `arguments` dictionary can specify different arguments for `NetworkPipeline.fit` or `NetworkPipeline.predict`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Forecasting example. Note convention for specifying different arguments \r\n# depending on whether NetworkPipeline.fit or  NetworkPipeline.predict is called.\r\n\r\npipe = NetworkPipeline(\r\n    steps=[\r\n        (\"imputer\", Imputer(method=\"drift\"), {\"fit\": {\"Z\": \"original_y\"}, \"predict\": None}),\r\n        (\"forecaster\", NaiveForecaster(strategy=\"last\", sp=12), {\"fit\": {\"y\": \"imputer\"}, \"predict\": {\"fh\": \"original_y\"}})\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Classification example\r\npipe = NetworkPipeline(\r\n        steps=[\r\n            (\"tabularizer\", Tabularizer(), {\"X\": \"original_X\"}),\r\n            ( \"classifier\", DummyClassifier(strategy=\"prior\"), {\r\n                         fit\": {\"X\": \"tabularizer\", \"y\": \"original_y\"},\r\n                         \"predict\": {\"X\": \"tabularizer\"} })\r\n        ]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n- Is proposed interface intuitive?\r\n- Should the steps be executed sequentially or in any order defined by the user? This would be achieved if the `arguments` dictionary can refer to future steps.

Describe the issue linked to the documentation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTell us about the confusion introduced in the documentation.\r\n-->\r\nHey, first of all , i'd like to thank you guys for the contribution made to time series analyze. If you want to make sktime more popular, the documentation's readability&understand-ability is so important, especially the topic like data preparation. Since most of us are  familiar with the pandas and scikit, the transition is quit important for us. \r\n \r\nI have a multi-variate classification task.\r\nMy dataframe like below:\r\n![panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41810121/180977283-adca0d25-4e7a-4b6b-8aa9-5b34c34369eb.JPG)\r\nDue to some reason,some symbol lost some days records, like  #1 symblol has 1000 dates rows while #2 symblol only has 500 dates rows. I want use last 11 lags to classify current label's value. For example, for the first row, I will take the OHLC from the date 2014-10-30 to  2014-10-19, to predict the date of 2014-10-30's label. \r\nFirst of all, I convert the pandas(multi-index) to sktime's mtype(pd-multiindex)\r\ndata=pd.read_csv('etf_labels.csv',encoding='utf-8',parse_dates=[1])\r\ndata.sort_values(by=['symbol','date'], ascending=[True,True],inplace=True)\r\ndata.set_index(['symbol','date'],drop=True,inplace=True)\r\ny_train, y_test, X_train, X_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, X, test_size=30)\r\n# fit\r\nhc2.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\r\nValueError: y must be a np.array or a pd.Series, but found type: <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\r\n\r\nif change y_train to y_train.values\r\nhc2.fit(X_train, y_train.values)\r\nthen\r\nValueError: Mismatch in number of cases. Number in X = 1 nos in y = 2424\r\n\r\nfinally, i have read more than 2 days for the section of the data preparation, but still confused.\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTo enhance the document's readability and understand-ability, the detailed and complete example is preferable. \r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
