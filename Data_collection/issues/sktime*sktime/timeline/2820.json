\r\nNoa Ben Ami\r\n\r\n\r\n**Mentors:**\r\n@fkiraly, @lmmentel, @Lovkush-A \r\n  \r\n\r\n**Why did you join sktime's mentorship program?**\r\nI joined the mentorship program as part of a final seminar for my B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering.\r\nMy goals for the Seminar -\r\n\r\n- Contributing several algorithms to sktime\r\n- Understand the design and architecture of sktime \r\n- Taking part in a CI/CD open-source community\r\n\r\nThe mentoring program is a great way to achieve all of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What topics are you working on?**\r\n**Kalman Filter**\r\nThe Kalman Filter is an unsupervised algorithm consisting of several mathematical equations which are used to create an estimate of the state of a process.\r\nKalman Filter can be used as a Transformer or a Forecaster, and I’ve been working on integrating both estimators into sktime. \r\nTransformer -\r\n[issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1011), [PR](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/2611), [merged code](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/sktime/transformations/series/kalman_filter.py). \r\nForecaster -\r\n[issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2819), [draft PR](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/2853) \r\n**Semantic Segmentation algorithms** \r\nFLUSS (Fast Low-cost Unipotent Semantic Segmentation) and FLOSS (Fast Low-cost Online Semantic Segmentation) are “semantic segmentation” algorithms that divide a time series into internally consistent homogenous regions called regimes.\r\n[FLUSS issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2868), [FLOSS issue](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2820).\r\n\r\n\r\n**What are your learning goals?**\r\n- Learning about collaborative coding practices\r\n- Deepen my knowledge in machine learning algorithms for time series\r\n- Improve my coding skills by using aspects of software engineering.\r\n\r\n**What's next for you after the mentorship program?**\r\n<!-- Thanks for participating!
