option 2 would indeed be a kind of `GridSearch` imo, applied to a parameter `k`, subject to a metric for changepoint, segmentation or the like. This is probably easier in the supervised case.\r\n\r\nOption 1, I feel, would require some sort of logic that allows an estimator to produce a *parameter* rather than other predictions. I.e., an estimator that has only `fit`, and `get_fitted_params`? And then a kind of pipeline `FittedParamSetter`, with code like this?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nkfitter = KFitterSpecial(params)\r\nsegmenter = MySegmenter(more_params)\r\n\r\nsegmenter_with_ktuning = FittedParamSetter(\"k\", kfitter, segmenter)\r\n\r\n# or via dunder :-)\r\nsegmenter_with_ktuning = kfitter * segmenter\r\n# although how do we pass the information that the parameter passed is k? maybe like this\r\nkfitter * \"k\" * segmenter\r\n# or\r\nkfitter * \"k\" >> segmenter\r\n```\r\ndunder could be realized by giving every \"parameter estimator\" a multiply with string, which wraps it in a curried `FittedParamSetter`, and then plugs in the estimator where it deposits the fitted parameter.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1171251599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1171252128","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2901#issuecomment-1171252128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2901","id":1171252128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Fz-Og","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-30T13:56:18Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T13:56:18Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"re

I think this is related to the design question which came up in the annotation data generation discussion as well of whether or not everything needs to be an estimator.  Obviously there can be advantages to doing so (may help with composition for example), but we could also imagine writing our estimators so they accept functions as an argument (like sklearn's silhouette analysis for example) as well, which could also has its advantages in that we can use some of the great functionality in sklearn and other libraries (or leave it up to the user to define their own function!) while providing a sensible default! \r\n\r\nI am not necessarily coming down on either side strongly, and I am sure there are more advantages to the estimator route that I have not fully considered either!  Just wanted to point out that the question of this particular design choice has come up in a few places now!  Since it seems relevant to annotation stuff I wonder if we should discuss as a group at some point?
