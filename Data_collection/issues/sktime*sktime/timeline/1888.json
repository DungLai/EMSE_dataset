0.76\r\n2  0.25  0.25  0.12\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor distances, I'll be given something like \"SquaredDistance\" and \"EuclideanDistance\".\r\n\r\nAssume\r\n```\r\ndistances = [\"SquaredDistance\",

We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n@fkiraly:\r\n \r\nI'm a bit confused about how I should organise the code for this. There are two scenarios I can think of:\r\n \r\n1. I thought we had to do something like this:\r\nMake a class `CompositeDistance`, subclass of `NumbaDistance`. However, since `NumbaDistance` is an abstract class, I will have to implement `_distance_factory(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, ...)`. The issue with this is that I won't be passing numpy arrays, I will pass a dictionary (for example, `{\"x1\": np.array([1,2,3]), \"x2\": np.array([4,5,6]}`). So, I'm not sure if I should inherit from `NumbaDistance`. I can change the definition for `_distance_factory` in `NumbaDistance` to `_distance_factory(x: Union[np.ndarray, Dict[str, np.ndarray]], y: Union[np.ndarray, Dict[str, np.ndarray]])` and proceed, but not sure if I should do this. \r\n2. This is what I've done:\r\n    Make a class `Composite Distance`, with `__call__`. Example usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np \r\n>>> from sktime.distances.composite import CompositeDistance\r\n>>> cd = CompositeDistance(metrics=[\"euclidean\", \"squared\"], weights=[0.4,0.6], variables=[[\"x1\", \"x2\"], [\"x3\"]])\r\n>>> d1 = {\"x1\": np.array([1,2]), \"x2\": np.array([3,4]), \"x3\": np.array([5,6])} \r\n>>> d2 = {\"x1\": np.array([2,3]), \"x2\": np.array([4,5]), \"x3\": np.array([6,7])} \r\n>>> cd(d1, d2)\r\n2.331370849898476\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nI haven't added doc-strings and unit tests yet. Let me know if what I've done is the correct way, and I'll add doc-strings and UTs.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
