Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather substantial effort involving changes to how `sktime` is build and distributed. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n-  Add [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) (see [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) and [PEP 633](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0633/)]. The intention behind is to collect all package matadata and dependencies in one place.\r\n- Add sets of optional dependencies:\r\n    - `all_extras` all \"soft\" dependencies\r\n    - `dev` packages useful for development and testing\r\n    - `binder` packages required for binder and running notebook examples\r\n    - `docs` packages required to build the documentation\r\n- Add section to build time dependencies.\r\n- Refactor existing CI/CD pipelines to use the new build configuration.\r\n- Introduced a new CI/CD pipelines for running tests across win, mac, linux and py37, py38, py39 with github actions.\r\n- Removed the obsolete requirements files.\r\n- Include wheels build for macosx on arm64.\r\n\r\n**Removed**\r\n\r\n- ❌ Drop support for python3.6\r\n- ❌ Drop appveyor and azure pipelines\r\n\r\n**High level diagram for the CI/CD workflows**\r\n\r\n![sktime-cicd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989838/149678967-309054eb-e91e-4988-a6cf-321de0108eb8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nIt does not introduce any new runtime/install dependencies but it could introduce an optional development depencency/build system such as [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to simplify development/build/distribution.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changed to the CI/CD pipelines that would hopefully allow to drop ``appveyor`` and ``azure pipelines`` in favor of ``github actions`` which would simplify the current build and maintenance process.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5819282087,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc5A7iiizwAAAAFa2zKn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5819282087","actor":{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-27T22:30:46Z","rename":{"from":"[BUG] multiple tests related to `FRESH` fail on win and python 3.8.5 and 3.7.9","to":"[BUG] multiple tests related to `FRESH` fail on all platforms and python versions"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1002299585","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1803#issuecomment-1002299585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1803","id":1002299585,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc47veDB","user":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-28T22:04:49Z","updated_at":"2021-12-28T22:04:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"These tests compare the current outputs from the classifier to a set of saved results.
