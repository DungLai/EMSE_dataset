your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWhen doing feature engineering, we want to calculate new features by means of any transformer and add them to existing ones. For this there is a need for a new transformer composition called `Featurizer` which gets any `_SeriesToSeriesTransformer` and appends the transformed data as new columns instead of overwriting the input data. `Featurizer` could either get a single transformer or a list of transformers (advanced implementation), this two cases look as follows.\r\n\r\nRelated: #1174\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen, ideally taking into consideration the existing toolbox design, classes and methods.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUse case when getting a single transformer:\r\n```python\r\npipe = ForecastingPipeline(steps=[\r\n    (\"imputer\", Imputer(method=\"mean\")),\r\n    (\"minmaxscaler\", Featurizer(TabularToSeriesAdaptor(MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(1,2))))),\r\n    (\"boxcox\", Featurizer(TabularToSeriesAdaptor(PowerTransformer(method=\"box-cox\")))),\r\n    (\"forecaster\", AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True))])\r\npipe.fit(y=y_train, X=X_train)\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the `boxcox` gets also the newly added features from `minmaxscaler`, whereas below the features are appended in parallel and not in sequence.\r\nUse case when getting a list of transformers:\r\n```python\r\npipe = ForecastingPipeline(steps=[\r\n    (\"imputer\", Imputer(method=\"mean\")),\r\n    (\"featurizer\", Featurizer(\r\n        (\"minmaxscaler\", TabularToSeriesAdaptor(MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(1,2)))),\r\n        (\"boxcox\", TabularToSeriesAdaptor(PowerTransformer(method=\"box-cox\"))),\r\n    )),\r\n    (\"forecaster\", AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True))])\r\npipe.fit(y=y_train, X=X_train)\r\n```\r\nThe `Featurizer` would by default add the new columns by means of a suffix which is derived from the name of the transformer. Otherwise there could be a praram `suffix` and `prefix` so that user can also define this optionally.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nPipelining\r\n\r\nAny opinions @RNKuhns @mloning @fkiraly

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\n\r\nI have a very specific forecasting use case that I solved elsewhere on my own. But only recently I discovered this fantastic library and obviously regret that it did not happen much earlier. I think that my use case could be a nice contribution.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the following. Suppose I have disaggregated data `y` and `X`. \"Disaggregated\" means that the forecasting frequency is, say, weekly, but the raw data is daily. My model extracts exogenous features from the past daily data (`X_train`) and uses an \"auxiliary\" model to forecast those features (`X_test`) which are in turn used in `.predict` method of the main forecaster. The current limitation of the library is that all the splitters and evaluation function assume that the data is already \"regular\", in my case weekly. This of course is not a problem if I only want to forecast once. But evaluation with `sktime.forecasting.model_evaluation._functions.evaluate` is impossible.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen, ideally taking into consideration the existing toolbox design, classes and methods.\r\n\r\nI see two alternative solutions. Either a couple of new splitters alternative to existing ones, or a generalization of existing ones. The core change I need is replacing `np.arange` (e.g. in `train = np.arange(start - window_length, split_point)`) by pandas Series or DataFrame indices that are not directly linked to a regular grid. Function `sktime.forecasting.model_evaluation._functions._split` will have to be changed as well by rewriting this arithmetic: `test = np.arange(test[0] - fh.min(), test[-1]) + 1`. At the first glance it seems enough.\r\n\r\nGiven these changes I can easily imagine a forecasting pipeline where one of the steps would be an auxiliary model forecaster that would generate `X` on-the-fly. Next step would be data aggregation into, say, weekly frequency. And finally a main usual time series model for a regular frequency data.\r\n\r\nI would love to contribute the solution myself. But I write this issue first in order to prevent unnecessary work if my solution violates some high level vision of the core developers. Please, let me know how do I proceed.

implement some dunder methods for forecaster and transformer composites (and, possibly, discuss design):\r\n\r\n- [ ] `**` for applying a transformer to `X` into a forecaster, via `ForecastingPipeline`\r\n- [ ]  `-` for `OptionalPassthrough` applied to a transformer\r\n- [x] `|` for `MultiplexForecaster`\r\n- [x] implement `MultiplexTransformer`\r\n- [x] `|` for `MultiplexTransformer`\r\n\r\nI should also mention existing constructs of the same kind, where we can look at (and possibly modify) existing design, and where we need to think about interactions:\r\n\r\n* `*` tor chaining transformers, in a `TransformerPipeline`\r\n* `+` for parallel application and output concatenation of transformers, in `FeatureUnion`\r\n* `*` for chaining transformers to a classifier, in `ClassifierPipeline`\r\n* `*` for applying transformers to input `y` and forecasting output of a forecaster, via `TransformedTargetForecaster`\r\n\r\nOne of the core design ideas for the dunders is to avoid having users search for the \"right class\", instead we want to use the parsing design pattern to create the right compositor class (or nested structure thereof).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
