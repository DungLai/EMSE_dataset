thought about this before, but I wasn't sure why the Tabularizer should be a transformer or a meta-estimator (wrapper), here's one reason why it should be a meta-estimator and not a transformer as it currently is: \r\n\r\nThe Tabularizer reduces the series-as-features setting to the tabular setting. It takes in a nested data frame (or whatever data format we use for the series-as-feature setting) and returns a tabular array (2d pd.DataFrame or np.array) which is compatible with the tabular setting of scikit-learn. This breaks the transformer scitype, which should have the same type for input and output, which is undesirable and already causes some problems in unit testing. \r\n\r\nBut note that there are other transformers that behave similarly, e.g. feature extractors which also return tabular data types. So \r\n\r\n* perhaps we need to separate scitypes more clearly. \r\n* perhaps we should also refactor the `Tabularizer` into a meta-estimator which wraps tabular estimators and applies them to series-as-features data, perhaps: `BinnedClassifier` or `TabularizedClassifier` with regressor counterparts?\r\n\r\nFYI @fkiraly based on our conversation of transformer scitypes.

of our most requested/used time series classifiers is the pipeline of `tsfresh` feature extraction and then an `sklearn` classifier. \r\n- [x] There should be a shorthand `TsfreshClassifier` for that.\r\n\r\nWe should create a module with simple  \"feature extraction based\" TSC strategies like this, e.g., `feature_extr_based`.\r\n\r\nOther shorthands that would be great to have:\r\n- [ ]  `TabularizerClassifier`, using the tabluarizer; a bonus feature would be using its potential \"good first issue\" extension to be created, the binner #242\r\n- [x] `MatrixProfileClassifier` using the matrix profile\r\n- [x] `SignatureClassifier` - using signature - this already exists in @jambo6's work, so just needs to be moved into the same \"TSC type\" sub-folder\r\n- [ ] `SevenNumberClassifier` - using the seven-number-summary of the series (quartiles, mean, variance). A nice feature would be the ability to specify which of these to use, or more \"sample summaries\" like kurtosis or other percentiles; this should not use any sequential features, only features where the order does not matter.\r\n\r\nAll of these will have parameters: `estimator` - a `sklearn` classifier; and any parameters that come from the feature extractor, without additional nesting level (that you would get from `Pipeline`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5830555539,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc4je-qzzwAAAAFbhzeT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5830555539","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-31T14:00:08Z","rename":{"from":"Extend

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nImplements `TimeBinner` transformer as requested in #242 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nAdds the option to specify custom intervals which to use for aggregating time series/panel data. In that sense, it generalizes `Tabularizer`\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n- [ ] Check for functionality on panel data other than `basic_motions` dataset\r\n- [ ] Implement alternatives to passing a `pd.IntervalIndex`\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
