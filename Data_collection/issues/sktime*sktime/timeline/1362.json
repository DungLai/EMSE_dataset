This is consistent with the literature (checked [Hyndman et al. (2008)](http://www.exponentialsmoothing.net/))\r\n\r\n- The function that calculates the forecast variance using the available analytical formulas is [_relative_forecast_variance](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/493ef60cbda3f3146b7430150b4fea0d31f05fda/statsmodels/tsa/exponential_smoothing/ets.py#L1501)\r\n- The function that calculates the prediction intervals is [pred_int](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/493ef60cbda3f3146b7430150b4fea0d31f05fda/statsmodels/tsa/exponential_smoothing/ets.py#L2323) (formulas or simulations)\r\n\r\n@fkiraly - slightly off-topic but I think adding a `simulate` method for forecasters that support generating simulated forecasts will be a good feature and we can then have have a single function that generates the prediction intervals using simulations. Example from statsmodels -> [simulate](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/493ef60cbda3f3146b7430150b4fea0d31f05fda/statsmodels/tsa/exponential_smoothing/ets.py#L1582)\r\n\r\nThe benefits of using simulations for prediction intervals as well as all the available theoretical formulas for ETS models are in Chapter 6 of [Hyndman et al.
