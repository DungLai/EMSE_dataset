For example, below code is working fine for me but I think one can use the above code to accomplish the same job (if the bug fixed ofc).  I am using `ColumnwiseTransformer` instead of `ColumnTransformer` in the below code and it works perfectly for `predict` and `update`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.boxcox import LogTransformer\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.exponent import ExponentTransformer\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.sarimax import SARIMAX\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.compose import OptionalPassthrough, ColumnwiseTransformer\r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\ny_train, y_test, X_train, X_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, X)\r\n\r\nselected_columns_1 = [\"GNP\", \"UNEMP\"]\r\nselected_columns_2 = [\"GNPDEFL\"]\r\n\r\n\r\ntransformer1 = ColumnwiseTransformer(LogTransformer(), columns=selected_columns_1)\r\ntransformer2 = ColumnwiseTransformer(ExponentTransformer(), columns=selected_columns_2)\r\n\r\npipe = transformer1 * transformer2\r\nmodel = pipe ** SARIMAX()\r\nmodel.fit(y_train, X_train)\r\n\r\n# Gives ValueError if OptionalPassthrough is not used\r\nmodel.predict(fh=[1, 2, 3, 4], X=X_test)\r\n\r\n# Gives TypeError either way\r\nmodel.update(y=y_test.iloc[:2], X=X_test.iloc[:2, :])\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Moreover, I have tried to use `ColumnSelect` to do the same job but it only transformed selected columns and drop the rest. Hence, I can't use it in the transformer pipeline.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntransformer1 = LogTransformer()[[\"GNP\", \"UNEMP\"]]\r\ntransformer2 = ExponentTransformer()[\"GNPDEFL\"]\r\n\r\npipe = transformer1 * transformer2\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1370310608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilkersigirci","id":39417966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDE3OTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39417966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci","html_url":"https://github.com/ilkersigirci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1372702835","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/4056#issuecomment-1372702835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4056","id":1372702835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5R0chz","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T20:23:19Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T20:27:18Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@ilkersigirci,

If you want to pass through columns unchanged, you can use the `Id` transformer.\r\n\r\nThank you for the code example but as I said in the last paragraph of my first message in the issue,  I don't want to drop untransformed columns, instead  I want to give them to the model. I think I can't use `ColumnSelect` for this and it seems the only option is using `ColumnwiseTransformer`.

think it would be a better approach  if `ColumnSelect` has a `passthrough` parameter (or similar functionality) when using in the pipeline. This enables us to make the transformation to some columns in one pipeline step but also allow other columns to be used with transformers in the next steps.

   You may like something like `ColumnSelect` that _keeps_ the other columns instead of discarding them? E.g., a `keep_other_columns` parameter or similar (default=`False`\r\n> \r\n\r\nMy preferred way is exactly this @fkiraly. Although this transformer isn't hard to implement, I haven't figured out how it can be used with dunders. Actually, at first look, I thought `ColumnSelect` works as you described above. It seems more intuitive for me.\r\n\r\nAnother approach that come to my mind would be adding `selected_columns:Optional[List[str]] = None` parameter to `BaseTransformer`. By default it is `None` and this would mean that the transformer will be applied to all columns. But if `selected_columns` is other than `None`, the transformer only transform those columns and passthrough rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample code.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.boxcox import LogTransformer\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\n\r\n_, X = load_longley()\r\ntransformer = Log(offset=1, selected_columns=[\"GNPDEFL\"])\r\n\r\n# Should only transform `GNPDEFL` and passthrough other columns.\r\ntransformer.fit_transform(X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach is already implemented in some transformers like `WindowSummarizer`. It has `target_cols` parameter for example. My suggestion is to unify this with all transformers by implementing in `BaseTransformer`\r\n\r\nBtw, the reason I don't like about `FeatureUnion` approach for `selected columns` is that it could easily become a nested monster pipeline. This is hard to see, debug and would lead to  more nested param set for operations like CV.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1377333909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilkersigirci","id":39417966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDE3OTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39417966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci","html_url":"https://github.com/ilkersigirci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkersigirci/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8192340373,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5aeynczwAAAAHoTTGV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8192340373","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-10T14:06:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
