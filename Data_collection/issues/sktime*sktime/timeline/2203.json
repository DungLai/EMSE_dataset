PR adds compatibility of `ForecastingPipeline` and `TransformedTargetForecaster` with:\r\n* the probabilistic forecasting interface points `predict_interval` etc\r\n* hierarchical and panel inputs for hierarchical, panel, global forecasting\r\n\r\nThis PR alsp:\r\n* fixes `_has_capability` for the case where tags can be dynamic (such as here)\r\n* adds test parameters to `ForecastingPipeline` and `TransformedTargetForecaster` that cover the probabilistic case\r\n* fixes one missing argument of `_predict_proba` in the extension template.\r\n* adds a `_transform` to the `ForecastingPipeline`.\r\n* fixes a broken error message in the `test_pred_int_tag` test\r\n* fixes `BaseForecaster` which was missing the `marginal` arg in `predict_proba`.\r\n\r\nAddresses parts of #2088, #2243, #2313.\r\n\r\nContains the fixes in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2322 which are necessary for tests not to break, since `_has_capability` has changed and that
