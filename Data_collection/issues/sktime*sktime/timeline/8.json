There is an \"obvious\" way to store the data in xpandas given the specifications, which is why I can image what a direct loading to xpandas would do. \r\n\r\nHow would you suggest the load-to-pandas and convert-pandas-to-xpandas would work? I.e., can you specify a suggested format? If there were a \"natural\" way, wouldn't it show directly that xpandas is unnecessary?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/451664489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/451682167","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/8#issuecomment-451682167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/8","id":451682167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTY4MjE2Nw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-05T19:03:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-05T19:03:18Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"There isn't one standard way, but a long-table format should work as a starting point, i.e. the output from `pandas.melt()`. Unless we want to re-implement most of pandas functionalities, xpandas will need some I/O methods from/to pandas at some point, e.g. for any other task like loading, cleaning, preprocessing, visualisation, etc. of data in Python. As I understand it, the purpose of xpandas is not to replace pandas, but rather to serve as an underlying data container in sktime which (hopefully) makes the entire workflow of modelling and evaluating supervised learning strategies with time-series/event-sequence/panel data much easier.

Given the wide range of data formats and tasks we are envisaging (univariate/multivariate, equi-spaced/time stamped, equal length/unequal, missing/no missing, timeseries only, timeseries+other variables, supervised/unsupervised) I think an interface from input data to xpandas (or pandas) makes sense. For example, in TSC, I know of many different formats people store data in (matlab, csv, arff etc etc). Its particularly relevant for multivariate TSC, where there is not obvious way (different file for each dimension, different block, delimited etc). I think faciliating the easy loading of data from everyones favourite file format into our data structures will make the code more appealing to the user. We dont have to implement all loaders, just make it clear how to write a bespoke one. \r\n\r\nedit: and I think we can knock together a prototype format reader quickly, then test if by writing an ARFF reader for univariate and multivariate TSC.
