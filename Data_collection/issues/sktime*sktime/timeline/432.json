Feel free to open a PR there and link it here! \r\n\r\nIt's important to think about classical forecasting (currently implemented), vector forecasting (predict multiple related series) and supervised forecasting (predict multiple independent series) and how we want to distinguish them. I'd start by taking a look at the [previous proposal for forecasting](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/master/steps/01_forecasting_api/01_forecasting_api.md) and some existing APIs (e.g. [gluon-ts](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts), [pyflux](https://pyflux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pysf](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/pysf)).

discussed in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/432 I would like an extension of the package to deal with multivariate data.\r\nThis pull requests adds a description of two possible containers for multivariate data.\r\n\r\nI like more the idea to store the data as pd.DataFrame object in the case of multivariate timeseries and it could be a sensible way to set a distinction in the fit/predict methods \r\n\r\n- isinstance(input, pd.Series)         -> Univariate case\r\n- isinstance(input, pd.DataFrame) -> Multivariate case\r\n\r\nIf anyone could give a hand I would like to adapt for example the NaiveForecaster to deal with multivariate data. From there adding other methods should be straightforward. Nevertheless, I don't want to spend much time adapting a model that ends up using an API that does not reach  a good consensus between users/developers of sktime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/enhancement-proposals/issues/4/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/enhancement-proposals/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/944395051","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/432#issuecomment-944395051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/432","id":944395051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc44SlMr","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T15:30:48Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T15:30:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thank
