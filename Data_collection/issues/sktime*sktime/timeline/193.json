This particular error is by design and not a bug - it would deviate from our original tsml implementation (e.g. [mirroring line 502 here](https://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/blob/master/src/main/java/timeseriesweka/filters/shapelet_transforms/ShapeletTransform.java) but raising the exception since fit/transform are disjoint in the sklearn pattern). \r\n\r\nI'll change the flair on this one as it's not a bug as-is but if you let me know a bit about the behaviour that you're after here then I'll certainly consider how I can work that in if it's appropriate\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJason","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/552378004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2787371851,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50Mjc4NzM3MTg1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2787371851","actor":{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T10:10:25Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2787371852,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3ODczNzE4NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2787371852","actor":{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T10:10:25Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/552380736","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/193#issuecomment-552380736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/193","id":552380736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjM4MDczNg==","user":{"login":"prockenschaub","id":15381732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgxNzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15381732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub","html_url":"https://github.com/prockenschaub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"cre

I would have expected a loocv to build new transforms rather than reusing the same transform (to avoid any potential cross-contamination). However, if that's not the default in sklean then it should be able to handle that.\r\n\r\nFor context, the issue in TSML is that `fit`/`transform` are not separate methods, so calling `process` does that shapelet extraction _and_ transforms the input data, or calling it a second time just does the transform and ignores the extraction step. This informed my decision to just raise an error if sktime's `fit` is called twice. However, in light of your observations then I think it would make more sense to allow fit to be called a second time and overwrite the original transform (perhaps providing a mutable warning to the user that the shapelets are being overwritten)\r\n\r\nI'll have a think but thanks for the
