Sorry for the duplicated issue, I was filtering by the keyword `SlidingWindowSplitter`. \r\n\r\nIn addition to @aiwalter 's input in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/520 (thanks for that!) I have some additional comment: In many practical situations I need the expanded-folds themselves. For example, when doing back testing: Suppose I need to run a forecast model on a daily basis (we train and predict on a daily basis) and I want to study the performance of an already selected model (let us say ARIMA(p=1, i=0, q=1), i.e. I do not need to select any parameters). Then I would like to train and predict on the expanded-folds to do an error analysis and understand what to expect of the model when deployed to production. \r\nDoes it make sense? üò¨ Is there a way of doing this with sktime 0.5.0?\r\n\r\nScikit-Learn has already something similar: [TimeSeriesSplit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html#sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit), but id does not offer as many options as `SlidingWindowSplitter`.

The sliding window splitter predicts only from some recent part of the available training data - this can make sense if there is non-stationarity or concept drift and you do not want to \"contaminate\" the forecaster with older data.\r\n@mloning, the additional point you raise is \"what the method does\" vs \"what the method has access to, given its template\". I think the template is designed to have access to all past data, but we can of course make specific methods which don't use it, e.g., due to the non-stationarity issue above.\r\n\r\nRegarding @aiwalter's suggestion, i.e., whether the expanding window should be a modification of `SlidingWindowSplitter`, I'm not sure.\r\nFor one, it makes sense, since you could simply re-train and forget the oldest data, or not, and that can be part of the same reduction strategy.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a more general wrapper strategy, which forces the wrapped forecaster to forget the oldest data. The wrapped forecaster would not have to be a strategy that reduces to supervised prediction, but could be any forecaster. Not sure whether it is useful or too general though?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/749100106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4136962669,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEzNjk2MjY2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4136962669","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-21T17:31:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4136962674,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMzY5NjI2NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4136962674","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-21T17:31:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4136962680,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEzNjk2MjY4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4136962680","actor":{"login":"juanitorduz","id":22996444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTk2NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22996444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz","html_url":"https://github.com/juanitorduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-21T17:31:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4136962685,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMzY5NjI2ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4136962685","actor":{"login":"juanitorduz","id":22996444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTk2NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserconten

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI would like to add a backtesting class. We should ideally then also implement an expanding window splitter functionality as discussed in #552 . But the `Backtest` would just receive a splitter as an argument.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA class like `Backtest` (naming to be discussed) with a signature like this:\r\n```python\r\nclass Backtest(object):\r\n    \"\"\"Backtest forecasters\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    forecaster: estimator object\r\n    splitter: splitter object\r\n        e.g. SlidingWindowSplitter\r\n    score: function\r\n        A function like smape_loss that has y_pred, y_test as arguments and returns a float\r\n\r\n    Returns\r\n    ----------\r\n    error: float\r\n        Average error of fitted estimators calculated by means of the score function\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe class should have a `fit()` function like a regular estimator object. I guess a `predict()` function does not make sense here. The class will be able to also take a `forecaster` of type `ForecastingGridSearchCV`, as in production people might refit and tune the model by progress in time.\r\n\r\nOptionally, the class can print the number of fits, like in `ForecastingGridSearchCV` when fitting.\r\n\r\nI am not sure on how to structure the return and what else should be returned, I guess just return `self` and have the rest as class variables? We could do sth like in `ForecastingGridSearchCV` with the `cv_results_` variable, so we could also store there the errors, predictions  and also the params of each iteration (because params might differ when using a grid search as forecaster).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29627036/104709492-4ea57100-571f-11eb-9311-bf3920db1bcf.png)\r\n\r\nWhere should a class `Backtest` be placed in the `sktime` class structure? I propose `sktime/sktime/forecasting/model_backtest/_backtest.py`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
