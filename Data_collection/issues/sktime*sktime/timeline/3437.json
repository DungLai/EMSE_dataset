your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n- `EnsembleForecaster` does not have`_predict_interval capabilities\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- Add a check that all underlying forecasters have  `predict_var` or `predict_quantile` capabilities\r\n- To actually implement `_predict_interva`. Two possible solutions (inspired by discussion in a [Hyndman blog post](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-combinations/#forecasthybrid)):\r\n   - (Easy way) Take the widest possible intervals that includes all the intervals produced by the individual models. This is the method that the R library [ForecastHybrid](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecast-combinations/#forecasthybrid) uses. However, the prediction interval will likely be too conversative (i.e. wide). You only need one bad model and the interval coverage will seem terrible.\r\n   - (Hard way) \"Estimate the covariances between the different forecast errors, and then find the resulting variance expression for the linear combination of methods.\" -- this Rob Hyndman's suggestion (see ForecastHybrid link above). Further research is needed to find the appropriate algorithm for this.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3438/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
