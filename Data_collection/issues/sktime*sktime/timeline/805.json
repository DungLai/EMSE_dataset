intervals.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/896922312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ParthivNaresh","id":29577911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc3OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29577911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh","html_url":"https://github.com/ParthivNaresh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthivNaresh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5143037478,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE0MzAzNzQ3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5143037478","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T15:25:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5143037486,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNDMwMzc0ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5143037486","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T15:25:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/899418201","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/805#issuecomment-899418201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/805","id":899418201,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc41nAhZ","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T10:58:55Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T10:58:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks

the bug**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n-->\r\n`ForecastHorizon.to_relative` is wrong when using pandas date ranges with frequencies that are multiples of base frequencies (e.g \"2H\", \"30T\", \"10D\").\r\nI believe the cause is the function `_coerce_duration_to_int`.\r\n\r\nSeems to be related to #1435 and #1876 (sorry if this is a duplicate)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon\r\n\r\nfreq = '2H'\r\nt = pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', freq=freq, periods=5)\r\nfh_abs = ForecastingHorizon(t, is_relative=False)\r\nfh_rel = fh_abs.to_relative(cutoff=t.min())\r\nprint(fh_rel)\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nForecastingHorizon([0, 4, 8, 12, 16], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nOutput should be:\r\n```\r\nForecastingHorizon([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)\r\n```\r\nno matter what `freq` is.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see this bug in action, consider the following example of using a NaiveForecaster to predict a perfectly periodic time series:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.naive import NaiveForecaster\r\n\r\nsp = 5  # period\r\nn = sp * 2  # number of samples\r\n\r\ny = pd.Series(\r\n    index=pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', freq='2H', periods=n),\r\n    data=np.mod(np.arange(n), sp),\r\n)\r\n\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=sp)\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)\r\nforecaster = NaiveForecaster(strategy=\"last\", sp=sp)\r\nforecaster.fit(y_train)\r\ny_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)\r\nprint(y_test, y_pred, np.abs(y_pred - y_test).max(), sep='\\n\\n')\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n2021-01-01 10:00:00

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nConvert `PeriodIndex` `absolute` to `DatetimeIndex`, as well as `cutoff` and `start` `Period` to `Timestamp` before taking the difference between the two.\r\n\r\nThis circumvents the following bug in pandas:\r\n```\r\nperiods = pd.period_range(start=\"2021-01-01\", periods=3, freq=\"2H\")\r\nperiods - periods[0]\r\nOut: Index([<0 * Hours>, <4 * Hours>, <8 * Hours>], dtype = 'object')\r\n[v - periods[0] for v in periods]\r\nOut: Index([<0 * Hours>, <2 * Hours>, <4 * Hours>], dtype='object')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBug report scripts were added as explicit test cases and should be replaced later with lightweight unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1981/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1029062043","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/805#issuecomment-1029062043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/805","id":1029062043,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc49Vj2b","user":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-03T14:45:24Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T14:45:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"With
