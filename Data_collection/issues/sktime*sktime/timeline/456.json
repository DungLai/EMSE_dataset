PR #317 for previous catch22 discussion)\r\n\r\nSeparate cBOSS from BOSS. Small clean-up of BOSS, TDE and related documentation/examples/tests.\r\n\r\nImplementation of the catch22 transformer and Canonical Interval Forest classifier.  ~~The Windows OS issue from PR #317 has still not been resolved, as such both will raise an OSError if called in Windows. Tests for both will be skipped on Windows also, though im unsure if more will be needed for the general estimator tests.~~ \r\nEdit: I think Linux may be the broken one with Windows being more faithful actually. The original was tested on MacOS, with neither of the other OS fully replicating it. Putting all this stuff in contrib for now with disclaimers, very messy.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the above and interval based classifiers.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/453/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3940124282,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk0MDEyNDI4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3940124282","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-30T08:48:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3940124417,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5NDAxMjQ0MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3940124417","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8ba064b57b2ed30671a28b73c6a10a79c7169e5a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/8ba064b57b2ed30671a28b73c6a10a79c7169e5a","created_at":"2020-10-30T08:48:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
