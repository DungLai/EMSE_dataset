@fkiraly, I agree, we need better extension guidelines. I think we should write a \"developer guide\" in addition to the planned \"user guide\" and the scitype template should be part of that.\r\n\r\nIt should live in the docs. The wiki isn't very good for suggesting and reviewing changes collaboratively. I'm trying to slowly move away from the wiki for most things. \r\n\r\nWe should merge in the user guide (#377) first though, even with only some basic information and place holders, that way other people can see it and may be interested in contributing. Having a work-in-progress warning at the top of the page should be fine. Similarly, I'm happy to merge in a basic structure of the developer guide. I believe some sections from CONTRIBUTING.md should eventually also be moved into the developer guide.

working on the extension guidelines.\r\n\r\nQuick question on forecasting extension pattern.\r\nCan you confirm the following:\r\n\r\nTo implement a new forecaster, one should inherit from `_SktimeForecaster` and precisely one of the two `[...]ForecastingHorizonMixin`-s.\r\n\r\nThe extender needs to implement:\r\n* `fit`, writing to `self`\r\n* `_predict` (not `predict`!), reading from `self`\r\n* `update` (if the model can be run in update mode)\r\n* `update_predict` (if the model can be run in update mode)\r\n\r\nOptional implements:\r\n* `compute_pred_int` for prediction intervals\r\n* `_update_predict_single` for single-step update/predict\r\n* `get_fitted_params` for fitted parameter inspection\r\n\r\nnoting that some of these methods are implemented in `_SktimeForecaster` and will hence not raise the `BaseForecaster`'s

@big-o (creditef as contributor in the base classes):\r\n\r\nI wanted to work on #464 and looked at the base classes in forecasting, amongst others.\r\nI looked at the base classes and feel there is some unnecessary proliferation of classes going on.\r\n\r\nWhy: we seem to have two nested template base classes, `BaseForecaster` and `_SktimeForecaster`. \r\n\r\nThe (undocumented) extension pattern seems unnecessarily complicated.\r\nTo give one example, implementation of prediction (can you confirm that this is the intended pattern, see new post in #464):\r\n\r\nThe `BaseForecaster` expects from extender to inherit and implement `predict`. \r\nHowever, if you implement a sktime native forecaster (which most extenders will be concerned with), you have to inherit from `_SktimeForecaster`, which inherits `BaseForecaster` and implements `predict`, but now you have to implement `_predict`.\r\n\r\nI would strongly favour there being only one base class - with all private functions - and a clean docstring that states what to implement.\r\nOnly vendor adaptors and similar overrides should have nested template schemes.\r\nMixins (like for the forecasting horizon) are ok i.m.o.\r\nThat way, for example, one wouldn't have to track overrides through two parent classes...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, @mloning, @big-o? Next major version to refactor this?\r\nConsidering use of `abc` since it's getting a little complex?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/737155174","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/464#issuecomment-737155174","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/464","id":737155174,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNzE1NTE3NA==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-02T10:56:48Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T10:56:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@mloning,

Describe the issue linked to the documentation\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is documentation on how `sktime` could be linked to other time series libraries. From the code, it seems that the preferred method is to [use adapters](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/v0.5.1/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters), but I could not make out what the requirements are for the adpater. Something similar to [this](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html) would be helpful which will help guide what needs to be added to the adapter.\r\n\r\nIt looks like at least the `fit` method needs to be implemented, but [some adapters](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/v0.5.1/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_pmdarima.py) implement the `_predict` method while [others](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/v0.5.1/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_fbprophet.py) implement the `predict` method. I would greatly appreciate it if someone provide an overview of the requirements for these adapters?\r\n\r\nOne application could be to integrate some of the deep learning algorithms found in `darts` such as [this one](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/darts/models/nbeats.py), but I am sure there could be others that could be added as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/586/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/803318091","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/464#issuecomment-803318091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/464","id":803318091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzMxODA5MQ==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-20T13:21:27Z","updated_at":"2021-03-20T13:21:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@mloning, forgot to ping the draft here:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Scitype-interface-specification:-forecaster\r\n\r\nYou gave me feedback earlier and said that conceptual model & specs should be preceded by a quick overview.\r\nI've added that now - have a look.
