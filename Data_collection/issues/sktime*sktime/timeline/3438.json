easiest. It also follows the current API which takes a string alias (\"mean\", \"median\", \"min\", \"max\") for `aggfunc`.\r\n- IMO a general aggregation function is non-trivial (and could be a smell code) for one key reason: unlike point forecasts, ensembling forecast intervals requires either:\r\n   1. The underyling forecaster's \"metadata\" (e.g. the name of the forecaster)\r\n   2. Or estimates of the **pairwise covariance of forecast residuals** across all ensembled forecasters\r\n- To cover both cases, the input signature for a user provided Callable \"aggfunc_interval\" will likely be too broad with lots of optional / unused combinations of inputs.\r\n- I would like to stress the point about the \"covariances\". Unlike #3437, we really should not assume uncorrelated forecast residuals for `EnsembleForecaster`. This means that any linear combination of the variances (without covariance) will give very biased estimates.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion: we should be opinionated and just support a few \"methods\" (see next comment for breakdown) for aggregating prediction intervals / variances.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1250216991/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"topher-lo","id":46541035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46541035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/topher-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1250217792","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3438#issuecomment-1250217792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3438","id":1250217792,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5KhM9A","user":{"login":"topher-lo","id":46541035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46541035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/topher-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topher-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-18T08:13:15Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T08:13:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There seems to be two families of \"methods\" for aggregating prediction intervals:\r\n1.
