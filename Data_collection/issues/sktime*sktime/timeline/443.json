yeah dangerous might have been a bit of an extreme way to describe it!\n\nI know fastai does this but sklearn (where this package is inspired from)\nis always very direct in where the imports come

people get a good\nunderstanding of the underlying modules behind the package. And at the\nworst case they can always import * if they really want to.\n\nFor instance in one of my projects I just read in smape_loss but since the\nforecasting notebook just read imported * from sktime I had to look on\nGitHub to understand the package structure to be able to find where\nsmape_loss was and read that in\n\n\nOn Fri, Oct 23, 2020, 21:13 Markus Löning <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Thanks @evanmiller29 <https://github.com/evanmiller29>, good catch, added\n> it in #444 <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/444>!
