PR makes the following changes:\r\n* reactivates the `check_constructor` test, which was not executed since the test refactor since we forgot to rename it to start with `test`\r\n*  adds a test to `TestAllEstimators` which checks for interface non-compliance along the lines of the bug #2730, i.e., presence of a `**kwarg` signature element in `Class.__init__`.\r\n\r\nWhy does having `kwargs` signature elements mean interface non-compliance? `sktime` aims to be compliant with `scikit-learn`, and in particular the nested parameter interface of `scikit-learn`. That assumes that all parameters in the class constructors are explicitly named keyword arguments, and parameters exposed by the `scikit-learn` parameter interface are precisely the named keyword arguments. Passing parameters via unnamed keyword arguments is not caught by the parameter inspection and setter interface of `scikit-learn` or `sktime`. So far, this has been possible without setting off a test, and could lead to unexpected and buggy behaviour, as #2730 shows.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix #2731 for #2730 is merged, this correctly catches out `ARIMA` as non-compliant.\r\n\r\nRelies on the fixes in #2773, of #2733, to test that these are indeed fixes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2732/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6722893716,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCVKAsc5K3qbnzwAAAAGQtzeU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6722893716","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-01T20:37:28Z","project_card":{"id":82671689,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/82671689","project_id":5198515,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/5198515","column_name":"fixing","previous_column_name":"Needs

default) when the implementation is fixed to match the docstring.\r\n\r\nSo, either, the docstring should be corrected and refrain from claiming that more than one algorithm can be used internally;
