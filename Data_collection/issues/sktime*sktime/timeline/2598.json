pycaret version checks\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported [here](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues).\n\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/releases) of pycaret.\n\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the develop branch of pycaret (pip install -U git+https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret.git@develop).\n\n\n### Issue Description\n\nWhenever I try any values larger than 1 for the start of the forecast horizon I can't train any models with exogenous variables.\n\n### Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom pycaret.time_series import TSForecastingExperiment\r\n\r\ndates = pd.date_range('2019-01-1', '2022-04-15')\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0, 4000, size=len(dates)), index=dates, columns=['qtde'])\r\n\r\ndf = df.assign(exoge_1=lambda x: x.qtde*np.random.randint(0, 10))\r\n\r\nexp = TSForecastingExperiment()\r\n\r\nexp.setup(\r\n    data=df,\r\n    fh=np.arange(1, 4),\r\n    session_id=5005,\r\n    seasonal_period=['Y'],\r\n    fold=5,\r\n    enforce_exogenous=True,\r\n    target='qtde',\r\n)\r\n#this works\r\nbest = exp.compare_models(errors='raise', include=['knn_cds_dt'])\r\n\r\nexp.setup(\r\n    data=df,\r\n    fh=np.arange(2, 4),\r\n    session_id=5005,\r\n    seasonal_period=['Y'],\r\n    fold=5,\r\n    enforce_exogenous=True,\r\n    target='qtde',\r\n)\r\n\r\nexp.plot_model(\r\n    plot='cv',\r\n)\r\n#this dosen't\r\nbest = exp.compare_models(errors='raise', include=['knn_cds_dt'])\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nModels to be trained with no problems\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```python-traceback\n_RemoteTraceback

 Exactly my point. I do not think the blame is on splitters themselves. I understand that, despite the explicit wish of a user for a non-full range forecasting horizon, cross-validation, especially with exogenous variables, should be performed on the full range test window. As you have discovered yourself, the solution should not be implemented on splitters side, but on evaluation and cross-validation side, like in the reference you gave above.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be completely on a user's side. He/she should provide a full-range forecasting horizon and subset the results to only those horizons that are of interest.
