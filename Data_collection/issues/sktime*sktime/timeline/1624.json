Would it be possible for sktime fit to accept kwargs?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no, that would require a major API change and would \"break\" the unified interface pattern that half the world relies on... it's really a strong requirement that you can switch out different algorithms and the usage is absolutely *identical* as long as it is the same kind of algorithm (e.g., forecaster). Like a power plug.\r\n\r\nLack of a unified interface like this is one of the major design issues with DARTS currently, it's quite inhomogenous...\r\n\r\nHowever, in interfacing from `sktime` there is a simple way to achieve interface homogeneity:\r\n* any *hyper-parameters* should move to the constructor\r\n* any change in data representation you move as logic into `_fit`\r\n* conversions to `sktime` supported data representations can also be dealt with by `y_inner_mtype`, `X_inner_mtype` instead\r\n\r\nIn the example of nbeats: I believe it expects you to split your series into `train` and `val_series` before you fit.\r\nThat should really happen as part of the algorithm, i.e., in `_fit` of `sktime` you would take `y` and split it into `train` and `val`. That might require some specification how you split, i.e., a `train_val_cutoff` (a relative time stamp or, better, percentage perhaps?), which you can introduce as a parameter in the constructor.\r\n`verbose` also becomes a parameter in the constructor.\r\n\r\nIn the rnn model, you can do the same: `y` is split into `train_transformed` and `val_series`, and `sktime`'s `X` is split into `future_covariates` and `val_future_covariates` (I think)? For control where you split, you may have to introduce a `train_val_cutoff` again. `verbose` becomes a constructor argument.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/976529567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/976537727","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1624#issuecomment-976537727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1624","id":976537727,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc46NMh_","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-23T13:31:19Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T13:31:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"additionally,

I am not sure how much work is going on with respect to `sktime-dl` (@mloning ?), but adding this adapter would be a good idea in the interim. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to do the work on this and contribute this adapter to sktime (with guidance from you and others). Please let me know.
