It is also a matter of ownership. If a new algorithm comes along (we have a new interval classifier), then we will have joint ownership of single files, which is confusing. I want to retain the sub directories for classifiers. Series as features doesnt work either, since distance functions and distance based algorithms need to go somewhere.  Our four categories are forecasting, prediction, segmentation and event modelling. But then forecasting is prediction. The problem is, what then to call classification, regression and clustering. Apart from machine learning, I dont know, sorry!

Counter argument is still e.g. composition methods that apply to classification/regression, but not to e.g. segmentation (that is, to more than one task but not all).\r\n\r\n\r\nScatter brain/rambling/not fully formed thoughts ahead, sorry\r\n\r\nUltimately there's going to be redundancy somewhere in the structure most likely, question is what redundancy do you want to accept.\r\n\r\nIn what ways can these things reasonably be grouped?\r\n\r\n1. Input/Output\r\n    1a. series -> series transformers\r\n    1b. series -> vector transformers\r\n    1c. series -> double/vector predictors\r\n    1d. model -> model meta processes (composition, tuning, etc)\r\n    1e. a -> b general/other utilities \r\n    1f. etc.\r\n\r\n1.2 Output only? \r\n\r\n2. High level data tasks\r\n    2a. prediction (classification, regression, forecasting, etc.), aka predictors, estimators, models etc.\r\n    2b. composition\r\n    2c. selection\r\n    2d. tuning\r\n    2e. representation/transformation\r\n    2f. evaluation\r\n    2g. visualisation? \r\n    etcetc.\r\n\r\n3. Prediction tasks (basically the members of 2a)\r\n   3a. classification\r\n   3b. regression\r\n   etc. \r\n\r\n4. Conceptual algorithm type\r\n    3a. shapelet vs interval vs dictionary etc\r\n    3b. classical vs modern? \r\n\r\nOthers? \r\n\r\n4 is certainly the weakest (or maybe most niche?) grouping IMO, but parties want it in. I'd argue for 2 being the strongest. There's the question of whether prediction (or whatever name it could be) should be an encapsulating folder, or instead if classification,regression... should be their own top level folders, but yeah you need somewhere to put base.py for estimators so it makes sense for the prediction containing folder to be there really. \r\n\r\nThen when it comes to which redundancy to accept in relation to e.g. specific evaluation methods as per example above, you probably repeat the classification,regression... categories in each of composition, selection etc. as needed\r\n\r\n```\r\nsktime/\r\n    prediction/\r\n        base.py\r\n        classification/\r\n             base.py\r\n             dictionary_based/\r\n                  boss.py\r\n             ...\r\n        regression/\r\n            base.py\r\n            dictionary_based/\r\n                ...\r\n            ...\r\n         ...\r\n    evaluation/\r\n         base.py \r\n         ...\r\n         classification/ \r\n              classification_evaluation_methods.py  # only if needed beyond base/shared methods\r\n         forecasting/\r\n              sliding_window_splitter.py\r\n              ...         \r\n         ...\r\n    composition/\r\n         base.py \r\n         ...\r\n         classification/ \r\n              classification_composition_methods.py  # only if needed beyond base/shared methods\r\n         ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you argue for 3 being the strongest grouping over 2, you flip the priority of classification,regression etc and put that on top level, while duplicating prediction,evaluation,composition directories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of usage, the imports for some experiment you want to run would then be something like \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.prediction.forecasting import FancyForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.evaluation import SomeGenericEvalMetric\r\nfrom sktime.evaluation.forecasting import SlidingWindowSplitter \r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nand so on. From the point of view of a user, the redundancy might not even be that unattractive really, makes it obvious what methods can be shared between prediction tasks and what are specific. \r\n\r\nSo long as you ignore any code that might be useful for more than one but not all prediction tasks...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/584575115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"James-Large","id":44509982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTA5OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44509982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large","html_url":"https://github.com/James-Large","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Large/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/616708127","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/229#issuecomment-616708127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/229","id":616708127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjcwODEyNw==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-20T17:41:24Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T17:41:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I want to sort this out for the next release and I'll start working on this in the next few days. \r\n\r\nAs @James-Large pointed out, we basically have two sensible choices here (unless someone has another idea): either taking purpose/functionality as the top organising principle or the learning task.

What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nMajor refactoring and clean up of existing functionality: \r\n- [x] folder reorganisation #229 \r\n- [x] sklearn-compatibility checks, run sklearn's [estimator checks](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html?highlight=rolling%20your%20own%20estimator)\r\n- [x] consistent input checks for TSC #98 \r\n- [x] consistent unit checks for TSC #251 \r\n- [x] consistent is-fitted checks for TSC\r\n- [x] inherit from sktime's BaseEstimator\r\n- [x] linting #256 \r\n- [x] fix warnings\r\n\r\n#### Comments \r\nI had to remove a few classes which I couldn't make compliant with the basic scikit-learn API without major work, including\r\n* `transformers/spectral_based`, see #224 for refactoring and adding it back \r\n* removed our version of `GridSearchCV` as it was essentially the same as the one in scikit-learn\r\n* `HomogeneousColumnEnsembleClassifier`, but we still have the more flexible `ColumnEnsembleClassifier`\r\n* removed optional `check_input` kwarg (or parameter passed to fit)\r\n* moved strategies and tasks from `highlevel/` to `benchmarking/`, removed `highlevel/`\r\n* removed our `Pipeline`, but sklearn's pipeline should be fully
