What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nMajor refactoring and clean up of existing functionality: \r\n- [x] folder reorganisation #229 \r\n- [x] sklearn-compatibility checks, run sklearn's [estimator checks](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html?highlight=rolling%20your%20own%20estimator)\r\n- [x] consistent input checks for TSC #98 \r\n- [x] consistent unit checks for TSC #251 \r\n- [x] consistent is-fitted checks for TSC\r\n- [x] inherit from sktime's BaseEstimator\r\n- [x] linting #256 \r\n- [x] fix warnings\r\n\r\n#### Comments \r\nI had to remove a few classes which I couldn't make compliant with the basic scikit-learn API without major work, including\r\n* `transformers/spectral_based`, see #224 for refactoring and adding it back \r\n* removed our version of `GridSearchCV` as it was essentially the same as the one in scikit-learn\r\n* `HomogeneousColumnEnsembleClassifier`, but we still have the more flexible `ColumnEnsembleClassifier`\r\n* removed optional `check_input` kwarg (or parameter passed to fit)\r\n* moved strategies and tasks from `highlevel/` to `benchmarking/`, removed `highlevel/`\r\n* removed our `Pipeline`, but sklearn's pipeline
