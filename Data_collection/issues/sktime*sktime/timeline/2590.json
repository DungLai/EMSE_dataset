\r\n\r\n**First of all:**\r\nThis is a really nice issue/feature request. I would love to see it getting implemented in SKTIME, because as per the paper this will allow SKTIME usability also in Daily, Weekly data where there are multiple frequencies. Because of the whole issue around installation of Prophet, MSTL adds a competitive alternative for people who want an easy-to-install and easy-to-deploy alternative. (Docker based deployment of sktime with a dependency on Prophet is really time-taking and not so trivial)\r\n\r\n**Suggestion:**\r\nPassing only MSTL into STLForecaster wrapper, and getting rid of STL call.\r\nWhy?\r\nAfter looking at the source code of MSTL in statsmodels, it seems that it simply calls STL on the periods itself in increasing order. Meaning if periods/sp passed is 5 and 12, then first STL is done with 5 and then the seasonal components is extracted from Y (raw data). Then the remaining Y is used in STL with 12, and that's how the MSTL works.\r\nSo if a user passes sp is just [5] or plain int: 5, it works exactly as STL. So, it makes to simply adapt existing STLForecaster with MSTL.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\nMSTL is available currently in development version of statsmodels and not the released one, so I think this has to wait until MSTL is available on the released version of Statsmodels.\r\n\r\nPS: If you need any assitance, let me know.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1117178823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"indinewton","id":25198189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk4MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25198189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton","html_url":"https://github.com/indinewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6547615820,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5I1QEfzwAAAAGGRLBM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6547615820","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-04T11:02:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6547615830,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5I1QEfzwAAAAGGRLBW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6547615830","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-04T11:02:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1117189566","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2590#issuecomment-1117189566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2590","id":1117189566,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5ClvW-","user":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T11:13:13Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T11:13:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@indinewton

I would love to see it getting implemented in SKTIME, because as per the paper this will allow SKTIME usability also in Daily, Weekly data where there are multiple frequencies.\r\n\r\n@indinewton, it is actually already possible to deal with multiple seasonalities, by pipeline composition. Simply pipeline multiple deseasonalizers, at multiple frequencies, like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_pipeline_forecaster = Deseasonalizer(sp=seasonality1) * Deseasonalizer(sp=seasonality2) * etc * my_forecaster\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course mileage may vary, and this is a sequential model, as opposed to one like MSTL where you are doing a joint fit.\r\nHowever, this is simple and may already get you where you want. More \"fancy\" multi-seasonality models need to improve empirically above this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1117989523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6552787808,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5I1QEfzwAAAAGGk5tg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6552787808","actor":{"login":"indinewton","id":25198189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk4MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25198189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton","html_url":"https://github.com/indinewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-04T22:23:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6552787811,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5I1QEfzwAAAAGGk5tj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6552787811","actor":{"login":"indinewton","id":25198189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk4MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25198189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton","html_url":"https://github.com/indinewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-04T22:23:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1118027371","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2590#issuecomment-1118027371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2590","id":1118027371,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5Co75r","user":{"login":"indinewton","id":25198189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk4MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25198189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton","html_url":"https://github.com/indinewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T23:35:55Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T23:35:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@fkiraly actually the objective is not just to deseasonalise only, but rather to deseasonalise and forecast all the components at the same time. Piping transformers in sequence allows only one forecaster to be used at the end (as per the current pipeline classes in Forecasting module). If you want to forecast trend, season and residuals and then add them together to get forecast at raw non-decomposed time series level, it created, in past, an unnecessary maintenance debt. If there was any change in sktime base classes, it triggered mini code adaptations in downstream applications. Which is why instead of using STL from statsmodels, we use it from Sktime because of architectural harmony. So keeping that in mind, extending STLForecaster (in future) to MSTL decomposition method makes sense. \r\nBut we can discuss this further, if you want. One main argument work-wise to support this is that you already have STLForecaster class which can be extended with additional functionality. So technically it is not creating any noticeable code debt on sktime side.
