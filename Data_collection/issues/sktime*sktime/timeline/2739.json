in-between the conversions, as long as they do not change column names or type\r\n\r\nThen, it happens that:\r\n* after the first conversion, we have a `pd.DataFrame` with column name `y.name`\r\n* after the last conversion, we have a `pd.DataFrame` with column name `0`\r\n\r\nI.e., the name gets lost, and the column names are inconsistent between the two occurrences.\r\n\r\nIf the conversions occur in a context where naming consistency is assumed (like in the pipeline above), an exception is raised.\r\n\r\nThe context is created specifically by the pipeline in the test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1152938037","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2739#issuecomment-1152938037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2739","id":1152938037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5EuHA1","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-11T14:29:06Z","updated_at":"2022-06-11T14:29:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hm,

PR adds a patch to `NaiveForecaster` which currently seem to handle `pd.DataFrame` column names and `pd.Series` names inconsistently, potentially losing them in the process of applying some of the strategies.\r\n\r\nThis is addressed by a hard-fix of storing names/columns in `_fit` and overwriting whatever comes out of `_predict`.\r\nAt some point, we may want to untangle the nested, organically grown mess that is `NaiveForecaster` and clean it up, but until that day at least outputs have the right return format now.\r\n\r\nIncludes #2790 to check that we've solved
