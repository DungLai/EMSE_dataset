@mloning , Yes. Basically, in my flow I have several models that I have trained individually and I finally want to also ensemble them as well. But during ensembling, they get trained again which seems like duplicated effort. I was wondering if a check could be added to see if the forecasters are already fitted and skip the fit for them to save time. When I looked at the code, it did not seem that the fit in the ensemble was any different from a regular fit so I think this would still work.

If you could construct a model partially fitted, the conceptual model for what `fit` does would be inconsistent.

If there are multiple models that are passed to the ensemble object and each of them have been fit using a Grid Search approach, it can take a long time and since the ensemble is currently only taking means, it is essentially duplicating the effort of fitting and doubling the training time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/756386584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4181705836,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE4MTcwNTgzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4181705836","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-07T21:10:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4181705839,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxODE3MDU4Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4181705839","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-07T21:10:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/756518533","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/584#issuecomment-756518533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/584","id":756518533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjUxODUzMw==","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-08T03:07:52Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T03:07:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fkiraly \r\n\r\n> My general opinion on the suggestion is that this comes at a substantial danger of information leakage, and \"training on the test set via the modeller's brain\".\r\n\r\nI can see where this would be an issue, especially when the ensemble is used with cross validation. Yes, that would be an issue for sure and may lead to leakage.\r\n\r\n@mloning Sorry I missed your earlier message. \r\n\r\n> What you want to do is also already possible: you can also fit all models using ensemble and then retrieve the individual fitted models and see how they perform individually, no?\r\n\r\nI think this is one option, but sometimes, you may only want to feed a subset of the individual models to the ensemble (only the top performing ones so as to not deteriorate the ensemble's performance), so the fitting all models using the ensemble, then pulling out the bad performing ones and refitting the good ones in the ensemble seems convoluted.\r\n\r\nGiven both your feedback, I am also not sure what the best approach would be.
