The bug has existed since the first DL classifier import and the test had to be ignored for the reason specified by @achieveordie. One of the tried out solutions was to have a specified `random_state` but that, for some reason, did not pass all the tests all the time.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am saying it might not be neccessary to solve this is:\r\n1. As discussed with @TonyBagnall  some months ago, when we do incorporate GPU support for DL estimators (which will be required) there will be randomness which is going to cause slightly different values. GPU support work was started by my in #3072  but had been abandoned since my focus was more on other estimator migration. Hence there always will be some randomness in the result leading to some divergence.\r\n2. If the idea is to just fine tune the number of significance digit difference, even then I feel it would be not easily generalisable. As @achieveordie  mentions, there are some cases where there are very less divergence (to satisfy idempotent test if I recall correctly they had to be similar upto 1e-6) but in some cases it is more. It would be difficult to find a general limit which will satisfy all the estimators, especially if we even can find a threshold we would also need to make it general enough such that any future estimators are held to the same threshold (which may or may not be the case since the estimators present are faithful to the original implementation by authors, there would not be much scope for change)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1287759403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AurumnPegasus","id":54315149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzE1MTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54315149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus","html_url":"https://github.com/AurumnPegasus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AurumnPegasus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7645711467,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5UWPKBzwAAAAHHuExr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7645711467","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-22T10:50:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7645711470,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5UWPKBzwAAAAHHuExu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7645711470","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-22T10:50:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7645711472,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5UWPKBzwAAAAHHuExw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7645711472","actor":{"login":"achieveordie","id":54197164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTk3MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54197164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie","html_url":"https://github.com/achieveordie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/achieveordie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-22T10:50:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7645711474,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5UWPKBzwAAAAHHuExy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issue
