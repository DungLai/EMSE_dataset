is a merge/review ready sketch for how multivariate `y` could be supported for multivariate forecasters, alongside the possibility to pass `np.array` and `pd.Series`. This is based on the design in [STEP no.5](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/tree/main/steps/05_scitype_based_IO_checks), adapted to the new forecasting base class.\r\n\r\nThe key ingredient are:\r\n\r\n* converters parameterized by from, to, and as - in the `convertIO`module. Besides the obvious conversion functionality, the converters can be given access to a dictionary via reference in the `store` argument, where information for inverting lossy conversions (like from `pd.DataFrame` to `np.array`) can be stored\r\n* a new tag `y_type` which encodes the type of `y` that the private `_fit`, `_predict`, and `_update` assume internally - for now, it's just one type and not a list of compatible types\r\n* some logic in the public \"plumbing\" area of `fit`, `predict`, `update`, which converts inputs to the public layer to the desired input of the logic layer and back\r\n\r\nThis is for discussion, and I expect major change before we merge.\r\n\r\nIt might be especially interesting to discuss the following interaction with typing:\r\nthe third argument of the converter, the \"as\" argument, is a scitype, and designed to have the same name as the respective `typing` composite type. Also see discussion in #965, #973 and #974.\r\n\r\nThinking of the logical continuation of this:\r\n\r\n* extend this to the other arguments, e.g., `X`\r\n* the individual argument checks like `check_X` etc should be replaced by checks of the kind `check(what, as : scitype)`, e.g., `check(y, \"Series\")` should replace the less generic `check_y`.\r\n* extend this to time series classification, to support 3D numpy arrays, awkward arrays, nested data frames\r\n\r\nA \"visionary\" pathway may see this working with type annotations that are scitypes, not `typing` machine types, e.g.,\r\n```python\r\nfit(X : Series, Y : Series)\r\netc\r\n_fit(X: Series, Y : UnivariateSeries)\r\n```\r\nand checks/conversions being done automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/871434968","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/974#issuecomment-871434968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/974","id":871434968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTQzNDk2OA==","user":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-30T14:05:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T14:05:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nRequires PR #1423 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThe current convert module only allows direct conversions. For example currently if I have a nested_univ and want to make it into a numpy_flat I am unable to do this. This is because there is no direct conversion between the two implemented. However, there is an indirect conversion that can be done which is nested_univ -> numpy3D -> numpy_flat. This pr has updated the convert module to allow these indirect paths to be found and used. Therefore this pr greatly improves the coverage of conversions.\r\n\r\nIt does this by using an adjacency matrix which defines which conversion are avaliable and then using dijsktras optimal path to find an indirect path.\r\n\r\nIn addition using this methods the weights (or length of the paths) can be adjusted to only allow lossy or lossless conversions. This is taken into account and when the user wants a lossless conversion to be done paths that would lead to loss are not considered. However, when the user is fine with loss then all paths are considered.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nRequires PR #1423 as this contains the enums needed to find paths.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
