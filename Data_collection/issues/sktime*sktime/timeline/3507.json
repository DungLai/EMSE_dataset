I need to have a closer look at Transformations because I dont fully understand what has happened to transformers this last year. I do know that you should no longer pass data to the transformer in (n_case, series_length) format, because transformers no longer handle (n_case, series_length) in a way compatible with scikit learn type representation. \r\n\r\nI think this \r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.rocket import MiniRocket\r\ntrain = np.random.rand(100, 2000).astype(\"float32\")\r\nt = MiniRocket()\r\nt.fit(train)\r\nt.transform(train)\r\n\r\nis now simply incorrect usage, and if it is used as such will create logical or runtime errors that will be very hard to detect and create incorrect results. There is no longer a distinction between \"panel\" and \"series\" data, and (n_case, series_length) is not treated as modelling multiple instances. This is a bug in my opinion. I think the classification transformer should throw an error if passed 2d numpy. I would have preferred to have kept the distinction of different behaviour, but it is all so deeply embedded in datatypes etc this seems the most practical solution to me, at least short term. Use of 2D numpy in classification was in fact introduced a year or so into the project. I pushed for it simply for scikit compatibility. One option would be just to remove the option. Another would be to subtype the two types of transformer again. Neither is trivial, and for now I think an error is the best way for all panel transformers.
