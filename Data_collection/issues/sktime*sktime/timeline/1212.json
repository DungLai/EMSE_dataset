This was highlighted by @flix6x in #1167, and has been addressed in the newest development version. So the *first* breakage point is resolved, just not in the version that's on `pip`. It will be in the next release.\r\n* the second error relates to the convention tha `DatetimeIndex` must have a `freq` parameter set - yours is likely `None`. The reason is that without this most methods can't easily translate the dates into integer multiples of a period, internally. If you created the index yourself, you may want to set it explicitly or infer it, see the [`pandas` docs here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeIndex.html).\r\n\r\nLooking at this second point, I agree that the message is ambiguous and the behaviour is unintuitive.\r\n\r\nI would hence propose is the following behaviour in this case, i.e., if the index is `DatetimeIndex` and `freq` is `None` (not set), in `predict`:\r\n\r\n* integer index is assumed on both train data and forecast horizon\r\n* a warning message is displayed for forecasters that cannot handle non-equally spaced data, stating that the method is considering it equally spaced\r\n\r\n@Data-drone, what do you think of this behaviour? @flix6x, what do you think (since this is closely related to your problem in #1167)?\r\n\r\n@mloning, @aiwalter (authors of original `fh` logic), FYI, any

you can set it in the constructor when you create it, as outlined in the examples in the [pandas doc](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeIndex.html).\r\nSo, for instance `myindex = DatetimeIndex(sthsth, freq=\"D\")` for daily frequency.\r\n\r\nYou can also convert a `freq`-less pandas object using the [`asfreq` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.asfreq.html).\r\n\r\nIf you post your code (doesn't need to be with the original data frames), happy to help you modifying it.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to just use integer/range index instead - this quick hack would be to just to drop the index entirely, if it's equally spaced, using `reset_index(drop=True)` - you'd then have to calculate back to

In my experience, a `DatetimeIndex` with no `freq` attribute is often a time series with either some missing data points (missing an index) or duplicate data points (having equal indices), with some of them not even being missed (or used), depending on the model and the seasonal periodicity.\r\n\r\nIf you want to handle such cases without throwing back an informative exception to the user, I think the user should be able to pass the intended frequency to sktime explictly (even with priority over the freq from the DatetimeIndex) . You might then consider reindexing internally using `date_range` and the `min()` and `max()` of the original index (i.e. introducing NaN values for formerly missing indices, but I'm not sure what happens to formerly duplicate indices). Especially for training data, you could also consider imputing missing data points and weighing duplicate data points to avoid models tripping over them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/888300004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Flix6x","id":30658763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU4NzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30658763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x","html_url":"https://github.com/Flix6x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flix6x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/889047928","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1212#issuecomment-889047928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1212","id":889047928,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc40_ct4","user":{"login":"Data-drone","id":4410493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA0OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4410493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone","html_url":"https://github.com/Data-drone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Data-drone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-29T11:43:41Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T11:43:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Good
