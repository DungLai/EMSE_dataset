Most *big* libs are strictly following a semantic versioning such that there is no backward incompatibility with minor version. Worst case scenario are deprecation warnings.   \r\n\r\nYes, I think this is a good general stance, bounding MAJOR is probably the right thing imo.\r\n\r\n> But of course, I've never participated to `sktime` so it's just my two cents.\r\n\r\nWell, there's a few recurring issues we've had over time that are perhaps `sktime` specific:\r\n\r\n* some developers have been accessing private interfaces in dependencies that are subject to change in MINOR or PATCH, which is bad practice but in older pieces of code that hasn't been reviewed well. An example is the recent sklearn bump https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3906\r\n* `pandas` has been causing trouble in MINOR updates in functionality around (multi-)indices and the `freq` attribute which is important in `sktime`. Given that this may propagate through soft dependencies that in turn depend on `pandas`, it's been a bit risky recently\r\n\r\nSo, the stricter bounds are trying to err on the side of caution here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1345387406/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8013756001,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5YhFPJzwAAAAHdqDZh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8013756001","actor":{"login":"aquemy","id":1913007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTMwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy","html_url":"https://github.com/aquemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aquemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f4f45a911f1f10bf731cbd2468d42077035e86d7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aquemy/sktime/commits/f4f45a911f1f10bf731cbd2468d42077035e86d7","created_at":"2022-12-12T12:34:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8074029863,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc5YhFPJzwAAAAHhP-sn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8074029863","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-20T00:50:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8074029905,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5YhFPJzwAAAAHhP-tR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/8074029905","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0442f46d8c00940f3329d325a09628c252266b94","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/commits/0442f46d8c00940f3329d325a09628c252266b94","created_at":"2022-12-20T00:50:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
