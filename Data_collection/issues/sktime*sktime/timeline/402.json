Reference Issues/PRs\r\n#402 \r\n\r\nOther related issues:\r\n#217 #15 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n* Adds 3d numpy arrays as supported input types for the series-as-features setting (classification, regression, etc) via `coerce_numpy` and `coerce_pandas` kwarg in input validation functions, so estimators can decide internally which representation to use and which representation to return (transformers)\r\n* Changes to algorithms to directly handle numpy input, otherwise added `coerce_to_pandas` flag to input checks\r\n* Added tests for 3d numpy input to all series-as-feature estimators, including classifiers, regressors and transformers \r\n\r\n#### Additional changes\r\n* Adds `sktime.classification.all` and `sktime.regression.all` for easy importing\r\n* Deprecates `tabularize` in favour of `from_nested_to_2d_numpy` for consistency\r\n* Bug fix in `RandomIntervalSpectralForest` to achieve random state consistency\r\n* Handling of empty results in unit tests to fix flaky tests for `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor`\r\n* Added decorator for raising deprecation warning\r\n* Added unit tests for unit test framework \r\n* Minor formatting changes\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3919282886,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzkxOTI4Mjg4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3919282886","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-26T07:39:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3919282913,"node_id":"MDI2Ok1vdmVkQ29sdW1uc0luUHJvamVjdEV2ZW50MzkxOTI4MjkxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3919282913","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-26T07:39:22Z","project_card":{"id":46196863,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/46196863","project_id":2046129,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/2046129","column_name":"Done","previous_column_name":"ToDo"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3919283383,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzkxOTI4MzM4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3919283383","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-26T07:39:29Z","rename":{"from":"Add
