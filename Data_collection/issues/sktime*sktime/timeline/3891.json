@pabhidnya15 - The implementations for all these distance is avaliable from sktime.distances. Unfortunatly we have some internal issue that mean some don't want these to be public facing functions and instead wrapped in classes (don't ask me why I strongly disgree with this).\r\n\r\nHowever, you can still access all this code even though it is not on the public API:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.distances import distance\r\n\r\nx_2d = np.array(\r\n    [[2, 35, 14, 5, 68, 7.5, 68, 7, 11, 13], [5, 68, 7.5, 68, 7, 11, 13, 5, 68, 7]]\r\n)\r\ny_2d = np.array(\r\n    [[8, 19, 10, 12, 68, 7.5, 60, 7, 10, 14], [15, 12, 4, 62, 17, 10, 3, 15, 48, 7]]\r\n)\r\n\r\ndistance(x_2d, y_2d, metric='dtw')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will perform the dependent dtw which is implemented and results are checked against results from 'The great multivariate time series classification bake off: a review and experimental evaluation of recent algorithmic advances'.\r\n\r\nIn addition we have implementations of all of the dependent distances from that paper that can be used in the same way:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndistance(x_2d, y_2d, metric='dtw')\r\ndistance(x_2d, y_2d, metric='ddtw')\r\ndistance(x_2d, y_2d, metric='wdtw')\r\ndistance(x_2d, y_2d,
