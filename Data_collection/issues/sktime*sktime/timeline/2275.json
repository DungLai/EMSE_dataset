thank you for bringing this bug to our attention, this fixes https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2275.\r\n\r\nThere were three interacting bugs that are now fixed:\r\n\r\n* `BaseForecaster`'s default conversion of `predict_interval` to `predict_quantiles` was mathematically incorrect. It should have said `coverage = abs(1 - 2 * a)` but it said sth completely different. Not sure how that happened.\r\n* `BaseForecaster`'s default conversion of `predict_interval` to `predict_quantiles` could break on occasion when two (float/numerically) identical coverages were produced, due to non-unique indexing. This should be fixed now.\r\n* `ARIMA.predict_interval` was passing `coverage` as `alpha`, where `alpha` in `ARIMA` is in fact `1-coverage`. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\nSo, all should now hopefully be consistent. The example in #2275 now seems to return consistent results.\r\n\r\nAdding this to must haves for 0.11.0 since this seems quite critical (most `predict_quantiles` functions are broken, and `predict_interval` from `pmdarima`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1075770293","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2275#issuecomment-1075770293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2275","id":1075770293,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5AHvO1","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T00:08:05Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T00:08:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis

by @fkiraly: the below is not a bug, but a consequence of what seems like quite serious random variation in the prediction intervals and quantiles produced by `AutoETS`.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to investigate whether:\r\n* a random seed can be set in `AutoETS` to allow deterministic comparisons\r\n* whether the prediction intervals should be something different (e.g., variation predicted added to variation in re-sampling the prediction)\r\n* whether this fluctuation implies anything about the correctness of `AutoETS`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nFollowup from ##2275: AutoETS behavior still seems inconsistent in the 0.11.0 release (ARIMA and Theta has to be fixed now).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.ets import AutoETS\r\ny = load_airline()\r\n\r\nforecaster = AutoETS(auto=True, n_jobs=-1, sp=12)\r\nforecaster.fit(y, fh=[1,2,3])\r\n\r\n# return_pred_int and alpha are disabled in sktime 0.11.0\r\n# forecaster.predict(return_pred_int=True, alpha=0.05)\r\nforecaster.predict()\r\n\r\nforecaster.predict_quantiles(alpha=[0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.975])\r\n\r\nforecaster.predict_interval(coverage=[0.8, 0.9, 0.95])\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/160263672-3deed4ef-41cb-423a-9218-cab02994230b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWould have expected the point forecast to match 50% quantile and coverage = 80% to match quantiles [0.1, 0.9] and so on. This seems to be the case in ARIMA and ThetaForecaster but not in AutoETS.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.7.13 (default, Mar 16 2022, 17:37:17)  [GCC
