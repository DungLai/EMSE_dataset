It looks like this came without clear warning.\r\n\r\nBecause we had a defensive version bound `<1.5.0`, this did not propagate through to `sktime` in deployment.\r\n\r\nTo me, looks like a point in favour.\r\n\r\nI would suggest a policy where we keep defensive version bounds as long as we can react within a few weeks. As long as testing indicates, for a given dependency, that `sktime` would have broken, we should keep those bounds (say, until three times in a row of MINOR updates without issues?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1254605929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-19T08:08:51Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T08:08:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3816","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3816/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3816/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3816/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3816","id":1455197896,"node_id":"I_kwDOCVKAsc5WvI7I","number":3816,"title":"[BUG]

in #3816:\r\n\r\n> Of course, one can argue that our build should hold more specific versions as said by @RikStarmans, but I'm not sure what would be the \"right\" approach. On one hand, the current code enables us to catch and correct such changes while on the other we'd ensure the test suite works without fail.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, and earlier instances of \"update results in failure\" have made me open this issue, and prompted us to introduce some defensive version bounds on core packages.\r\n\r\nThe situation and trade-off is, however, not as straightforward as it may seem.\r\nUnfortunately it may be that the discussion we had internally was not recorded properly, or I'm just failing at finding it.\r\n\r\nThe main counterargument is as above: you introduce too many pins or bounds, then it becomes more and more difficult to find *any* working configuration if you are installing many packages - the argument is by the Kantian imperative, \"suppose everyone was doing this, what would happen\"?\r\n\r\nYou could now argue, ok, frameworks are more \"top-level\" than component packages, but people can also opt to install multiple frameworks, which may have incompatible dependency
