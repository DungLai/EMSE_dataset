isolate the problem to `pmdarima`'s `auto_arima` (using `sklearn` 1.0) and if that's where it's from, post on the `pmdarima` GitHub and link the issue here?\r\n\r\nOn our side, I think we need to understand why the tests are not catching this, e.g., does it occur only in a combination of specific versions that you have? The call to `fit` should be covered by the tests, testing `fit` etc is one of our most important automated checks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/939263738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5437890303,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc484ah4zwAAAAFEH57_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5437890303","actor":{"login":"asksteph","id":31328623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzI4NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31328623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph","html_url":"https://github.com/asksteph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-09T09:21:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5437890305,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc484ah4zwAAAAFEH58B","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5437890305","actor":{"login":"asksteph","id":31328623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzI4NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31328623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph","html_url":"https://github.com/asksteph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asksteph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-09T09:21:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5437890704,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCVKAsc484ah4zwAAAAFEH6CQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5437890704","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-09T09:21:30Z","rename":{"from":"[BUG]

\r\n\r\nAs a contributor from the `pmdarima` side, hopefully I can speak to the issue. We were utilizing `scikit-learn`'s [`if_delegate_has_method`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.metaestimators.if_delegate_has_method.html). That function has since been [deprecated](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20506) in favor of [`available_if`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.metaestimators.available_if.html?highlight=available_if#sklearn.utils.metaestimators.available_if). We had a [fix](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima/pull/455) in place fairly quickly after `scikit-learn`'s 1.0 release that will use `if_delegate_has_method` on older versions of `scikit-learn` and `available_if` on newer versions. This fix is included in `pmdarima` [1.8.3](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima/releases/tag/v1.8.3), but it does mean that `pmdarima` 1.8.2 and `scikit-learn` 1.0 are unfortunately incompatible.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this is a [legit bug on the `scikit-learn` side](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21144). The function may be deprecated, but it has not been removed. It is just bugged in 1.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/940414550/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aaronreidsmith","id":21350310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzUwMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21350310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronreidsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronreidsmith/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/940435804","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1503#issuecomment-940435804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1503","id":940435804,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc44Delc","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-11T20:59:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T20:59:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hello @aaronreidsmith!
