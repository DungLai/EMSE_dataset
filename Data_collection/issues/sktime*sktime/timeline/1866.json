that uses scenarios from #1819 for refactoring and simplifying the tests.\r\n\r\nMain rationale for this refactor:\r\n* the previous test suite was unable to run estimators through multiple input data scenarios without a lot of manual coding. This is now \"slot in\" via adding one more scenario in scenario config files.\r\n* this was needed to ensure reliable testing in two major development directions: transformers refactor (#1854), and hierarchical forecasting (#1818), since in both we decided with polymorphic inputs, i.e., estimators that can be used to `fit` and `predict`/`transform` both `Series` and `Panel` data. The previous test suite was able to test only one kind of input per estimator type.\r\n* the previous test suite relied a lot on if/else chains and for-loops for dispatch and iteration. The refactur result is more extensible and follows the open/closed principle better, in that scenarios and entire test modules are easier to add.\r\n\r\nRefactoring is carried out for `test_all_estimators` only, which signposts how the refactor for remaining tests would look like.\r\nThe high-level structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n* tests now rely additionaly rely on an additional type of fixture, \"scenarios\", which encode data that is passed to estimators, and methods that are sequentially called. Having multiple scenarios allow to test multiple sequences of data being passed as a formulaic test case across estimators, e.g., \"passing `fh` in `fit` and no `X`\" or \"passing `fh` only in `predict` and `X` and `y` that is multivariate\". See `_utils.testing.scenarios`. Uses #1819 (scenarios)\r\n* not all scenarios are applicable to all estimators (e.g., classifiers need `X` and `y` to be Panel/vector; some forecasters must be given `fh` in `fit`), hence this is reliant on some machinery to generate fixture combinations, namely estimator/scenario combinations. See `tests.test_all_estimators.pytest_generate_tests`. Uses #1839 (conditional fixture generation).\r\n* in the process of slightly more stringent testing, some bugs were discovered in individual estimators, which are being fixed as far it requires for the refactor to run. See #1846.\r\n* The test suite currently runs only 1:1 remaps of \"pre-refactor\" tests, while containing more scenarios. These could be run as well, but would cause a lot more estimators to fail, since these are scenarios that weren't stringently tested before. The larger set of scenarios can be easily switched on and off, by controlling how the `pre-refactor` tag oof scenarios is handled.\r\n\r\nConditional on PRs\r\n* test scenarios in #1819\r\n* the conditional fixture plugin for `pytest` in #1839\r\n* #1838 for retrieving scenarios applicable to specific estimators\r\n* extended `deep_equals` in #1844 for making nested equality comparisons\r\n* bugfixes in #1846 uncovered by more rigorous testing\r\n\r\nAfter this, the next step would be to wrap entire testing suites in classes. This will allow easy inheritance across modules, a \"one-stop-function\" to test new estimators with, and usage of the test suite in third party packages.\r\n\r\nThe tests all pass, but this includes a few new escapes:\r\n\r\n* `STLTransformer`, `STLforecaster`, and `ConditionalDeseasonalizer`, due to ongoing, unresolved discussion on #1677, #1773\r\n* `StackingForecaster` on `test_predict_time_index_with_X`. Funny things seem to happen if `X` is passed, of unclear cause so far.\r\n* `MUSE`, seems to fail stochastically with higher probabiltiy on smaller data sets, see #1866 for `MUSE` and other classifiers which appear to fail deterministically on too small data sets (the latter are not escaped, since the scenarios have now been chosen to have large enough data to get around this).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1833/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1010885979","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1866#issuecomment-1010885979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1866","id":1010885979,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc48QOVb","user":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T10:22:25Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T10:22:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"not sure about MUSE, will try fix our two first then take a look at the other two.
