doing a time series experiment with the new 3.0 library. I have found that when I set the setup to do a logarithmic transformation of the target (transform_target='log') when making the forecasts, it applies the inverse transformation. \r\n\r\n### Whit

set the setup to do an imputation of the missings and then the logarithmic transformation (transform_target='log', numeric_imputation_target='drift'), when it makes the forecast, it doesn't apply the inverse transformation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#### Setup experiment ----\r\nexp = TSForecastingExperiment()\r\nexp.setup(data=y, fh=12, session_id=42, transform_target='log',\r\n

But this was wrong, the pipeline inverse should be skipped iff *all* components are skipping inverse.\r\n* `Imputer` skipped the inverse, and since it was in a pipeline with another transformer that did not skipped inverse, according to the old (wrong) rule, the entire sequence of inverses was skipped.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1193313808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-24T13:04:38Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T13:04:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3085","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3085/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3085/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3085/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3085","id":1315902688,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc47_poi","number":3085,"title":"[BUG]

PR fixes #3084.\r\n\r\nThis fixes some inconsistent logic in chaining inverse transforms in a pipeline that has some transformers skipping the inverse.\r\n\r\n* `TransformerPipeline` incorrectly skipped all inverses in the pipeline, if at least one element skipped its inverse. This has been fixed to the correct rule, all inverses are skipped if and only if all elements skip inverses.\r\n* The tag `skip-inverse-transform` was only used in interfacing composites like the `ForecastingPipeline`. This is spreading/decoupling. Instead, the logic to skip was moved to `BaseTransformer`: under the presence of the tag, the `inverse_transform` behaves like the identity transform now.\r\n* All the above connected to a third possible inconsistency in transformers, which had the `capability:inverse_transform` tag set to `False` while `skip-inverse-transform` was set to True, this would lead to contradictory behaviour, between point two (should pass through) and the capability tag behaviour (raised an error). Logic in the `TransformerPipeline` and tests has been reconciled.\r\n* `Aggregator` had the tags set inconsistently and was fixed.\r\n\r\nAdds test case which is a simplified version of #3084.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3085/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1193315076","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3084#issuecomment-1193315076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3084","id":1193315076,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HIIsE","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-24T13:07:20Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T13:07:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Fix here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3085","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1193315076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1193315198","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3084#issuecomment-1193315198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3084","id":1193315198,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5HIIt-","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-24T13:07:58Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T13:07:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @fkiraly.
