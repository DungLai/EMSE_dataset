would be happy to be more explicit!  I am still in the process of tracing all the code relevant to this, so this is probably a less than perfect understanding, but from what I could tell: \r\n- in the example which came up in issue 2807 `ForecastingGridSearch` we end up pre-trimming all `X` in a `fh` dependent manner via `_split` before passing it to `TransformedTargetForecaster`\r\n- but in reality, if we are working with something like `TransformedTargetForecaster` I think it doesn't really makes sense to trim the `X` until right before the forecasting step? (Usually it isn't an issue, but it will come up with transformers that change the size of `X` like we saw) \r\n- so the thought was, is there a way we can delay some of these pre-processing steps that are forecaster-specific until the step in `TransformedTargetForecaster` that is right before the actual forecasting part? \r\n\r\nI am not actually sure that the second bullet point above actually holds.  Is this a valid point, or are their actual cases where we would need to trim the `X` in this manner for transformers as well? I think my understanding on this might be less than

noticed + helpfully pointed out a strange bug that came up when using `Differencer` within `TransformedTargetForecaster` in `ForecastingGridSearchCV`.  (see #2807 and #2880)\r\n\r\nFrom what I could tell this bug was caused by the fact that `Differencer` reduces the size of `X`.  Usually this isn't a problem, but because `ForecastingGridSearchCV` was pre-trimming all `X` input before passing it into the underlying forecaster, `X` ended up being too small by the time it got to the final forecaster and was causing problems. \r\n\r\nMy proposed solution is thus simply - avoid pre-trimming `X` in the `_split` function and instead trim it to the right size right before the actual forecasting step. (I do this specifically in `_predict_last_window`, but there is a decent chance it might need to be changed elsewhere as well).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T17:29:41Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T17:29:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3132","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3132/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3132/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3132/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3132","id":1322511200,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc48VQp4","number":3132,"title":"[BUG]

noticed + helpfully pointed out a strange bug that came up when using Differencer within TransformedTargetForecaster in ForecastingGridSearchCV. (see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2807 and https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2880)\r\n\r\nFrom what I could tell this bug was caused by the fact that Differencer reduces the size of X. Usually this isn't a problem, but because ForecastingGridSearchCV was pre-trimming all X input before passing it into the underlying forecaster, X ended up being too small by the time it got to the final forecaster and was causing problems.\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution is thus simply - avoid pre-trimming X in the _split function and instead trim it to the right size right before the actual forecasting step. (I do this specifically in _predict_last_window, but there is a decent chance it might need to be changed elsewhere as well).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1230287383","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2880#issuecomment-1230287383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2880","id":1230287383,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5JVLIX","user":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T13:18:12Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T13:18:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"PR has been added.

the bug**\r\n\r\nmodel_evaluation.evaluate creates X_test containing both train and test samples.  For statsmodels models with exogenous features X_test length must equal the forecast horizon and therefore this currently throws the error:\r\n\r\n`ValueError: Provided exogenous values are not of the appropriate shape.`\r\n\r\nThis bug occurs for UnobservedComponents and SARIMAX.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the bug is in the `_split`

'X.iloc[test].sort_index()' for statsmodels models with exogenous features or alternatively by filtering X

Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nStatsmodels with exogenous features would raise an exception in `predict` if `X` contained more indices than the range of `fh`.\r\nThis was due to all indices being passed through to `statsmodels` `predict`.  The fix ensures that only the expected `X` indices from the test set are passed to `statsmodels` `predict`.\r\n\r\nFixes #3830 as this was also the root cause of the exception raised when using `evaluate` with `statsmodels` based estimators.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
