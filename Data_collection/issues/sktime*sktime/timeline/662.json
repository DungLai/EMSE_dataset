#662 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nUpdated `.binder/requirements.txt` so that binder-build finishes successfully. Have tested this by using `https://mybinder.org/` to build from my fork.\r\n\r\nThe changed requirement for `tsfresh` avoids an attempt to install `numpy-1.20.1` which is incompatible with `python 3.6` installed on binder and causes failed build. Extra line to address separate issue around `llvm` (see below).\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n`llvm-lite-0.16.0` is the default version installed on Binder. Including the extra line avoids a doomed re-installation attempt out of the `/.binder` subfolder, where a certain `llvm-config` can't be found. Later in the build process, `llvm-lite` is successfully updated to `0.35.0`, presumably because the path to `llvm-config` works from the main directory.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis is my first pull request, so any feedback is very welcome!\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/725/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-13T18:57:22Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T18:57:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/807","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/807/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/807/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/807/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/807","id":857029776,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4NTcwMjk3NzY=","number":807,"title":"[BUG]

Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #807\r\nFixes #662 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nThe Binder Dockerfile stopped working at some point. I changed the requirements files for the Docker file and it works now. The Docker file \"compiles\" and I ran the first example notebook in it. \r\n\r\nI changed the base Docker image used because the one that is in the current Dockerfile is just an arbitrary one copied from the Binder docs. I think that the Jupyter Notebook Python 3.8 is a reasonable base image because it already contains a bunch of the needed libraries and Python 3.8 is the newest version that can currently be used with Numba (according to my understanding).\r\n\r\nThis is not an optimal solution yet because something is broken with the way Prophet is being built but this can only be changed once the Prophet developers fix it. I know it is weird to have two requirement files but Prophet doesn't build without having some libraries installed first.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #807\r\nFixes #662 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nThe Binder Dockerfile stopped working at some point. I changed the requirements files for the Docker file and it works now. The Docker file \"compiles\" and I ran the first example notebook in it. \r\n\r\nI changed the base Docker image used because the one that is in the current Dockerfile is just an arbitrary one copied from the Binder docs. I think that the Jupyter Notebook Python 3.8 is a reasonable base image because it already contains some of the needed libraries and Python 3.8 is the newest version that can currently be used with Numba (according to my understanding).\r\n\r\nThis is not an optimal solution yet because something is broken with the way Prophet is being built but this can only be changed once the Prophet developers fix it. I know it is weird to have two requirement files but Prophet doesn't build without having some libraries installed first.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1266/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5147660281,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTE0NzY2MDI4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5147660281","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-12T08:34:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
