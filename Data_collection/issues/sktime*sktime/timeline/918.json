for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nFixes #918.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThe logic for the `\"last\"` strategy is now much more similar to the logic for the `\"mean\"` strategy. I refactored some of the logic to internal util functions so that it's clear that both strategies transform the `last_window` according to the seasonal periodicity in the same way, and also tile the results in the same way. The only difference is now that the `\"last\"` strategy selects the last non-NaN value from each seasonally periodic row, while the `\"mean\"` strategy computes the mean of said row.\r\n\r\nJust to note, to me it would make sense if the `\"drift\"` strategy would use the same util functions to:\r\n- make it robust against NaN values, both at the end of the time series and at the start, and\r\n- let it account for seasonal periodicity.\r\nI think this would be a separate issue, but just to be clear: I am not considering working on it, unless someone points me to a use case for this particular strategy.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n--> \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
