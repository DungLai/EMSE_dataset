personal opinion is, 1. should go.\r\nThe requirement of 1. is coming from `sklearn`, the rationale being that calling `fit` multiple times, and possibly `set_params` in-between, should be possible and result in the same state as after the last `fit` call.\r\n\r\nThis has, however, some negative consequences for the user which are discussed at the start of this issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1798\r\n\r\n`sklearn` has no choice in this imo, since there is no \"boilerplate\" layer and all the checks etc need to be implemented by a user every ime they write an estimator.\r\nWe, however, do have a choice - we can call parameter setting and checking logic from the layer between `fit` and `_fit`.\r\n\r\nLike this: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2562\r\n(https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1798 proposes a more extreme variant that might be overkill)\r\n\r\nWe still would be `sklearn` compatible, since the external logic would be indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nThere is one - positive! - exception:\r\nwith this, the user receives feedback at *specification* of an invalid estimator, not just at `fit` which is later.\r\nThis would be in line with the principle \"give feedback on invalid input as early as possible\", and `sklearn` is *not*  in line with that!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1112571274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-28T19:21:12Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T19:21:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2487","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2487/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2487/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/2487","id":1205638272,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc42S0IU","number":2487,"title":"[ENH]

a pair programming session with @lbventur (at the community meetup).\r\n\r\nThis PR solves #2478, it upgrades `Differencer` with NA handling parameter `na_handling`, which allows, besides the two current behaviours, a third behaviour `fill_zero` that fills zero.\r\n\r\nThis parameter replaces the boolean `drop_na` parameter, and adds deprecation with replacement at 0.13.0, and move to a `fill_zero` default.\r\n\r\nWhy is the `fill_zero` parameter a better default? It results in a \"same index\" and \"no NA\" condition at the end, which is the most compatible out of the alternatives when used in a pipeline.

(I am more familiar with `MultiplexForecaster` at the moment... haven't directly seen it other places, but thought I would ask!)  If it is only really seen in `MultiplexForecaster` - then as I mentioned in #2458 it is possible to not dynamically set tags in `MultiplexForecaster` (at least it is not necessary for `fit` to work)-in fact #2570 provides a way to do this by bypassing the fit call on `MultiplexForecaster`.  Though as #2570 stands it doesn't completely solve the other other issue you mentioned in relation to dynamically setting tags:\r\n\r\n>However, I see a problem with retrieval and querying, so while tempting I fear this might not work.\r\nThe problem arises because the tags on the outside would no longer be \"true\", so they cannot be relied upon anymore for giving correct answers about properties.\r\n>\r\n>For example, let's assume a user asking a pipeline \"can you work with multivariate data\"? The multiplexer would give the wrong answer.\r\nIt would also give the wrong answer if you further put the multiplexer in a pipeline, to the other parts of the pipeline that now wrap the multiplexer.\r\nAnother example, let's say we loop through forecaster instances in testing. We want to pass multivariate data to all forecasters that claim they are multivariate and check they do not raise the error. The multiplexer would then fail the test, because the inner forecaster cannot deal with the multivariate data, but the test would think that it should be able to.\r\n\r\nBut.... I think it could be an easy change for the new delegator approach to solve this problem as well!!!

Overview:\r\n\r\nThis issue is intended to be a spot for a design discussion for how to implement a new more general delegation functionality per a suggestion from @fkiraly .\r\n\r\nTo give some context for the issue at hand - many of the composite classes related to multiple estimator testing/comparison - e.g. `MultiplexForecaster` behave *like* a wrapper where most of their forecasting functionality is delegated to a wrapped forecaster. In implementing `MultiplexTransformer` it became clear a more general delegation functionality (that also extended to transformers) would be useful. And that the current delegation approach seemed to have some issues that required dynamic tag setting/might make it hard to apply to BaseGridSearch (which it would also be useful, as it has a very important `_fit` class).  #2570 is an attempt to solve this problem, however I think it has some design issues, so thought opening it up to move discussion might be very useful!\r\n\r\n### Summary of the Two Approaches:\r\n\r\n(*there are of course more than 2 ways to solve this problem, but this summarizes the approach I have implemented and the mixin approach already in place.  Also, just an attempt to  give a high level sense of what these two approaches are doing/how they differ, but I may have left something important out - so please chime in if I did. *)\r\n\r\n##### Current approach via the mixin (as it was implemented):\r\n- Have a `DelegatedForecaster` class each class requiring delegation inherits from (as a \"mixin\")\r\n- This class overwrites all the underscore methods (eg `_fit()`, `_predict()` etc) so that they are called on the delegated forecaster instead.\r\n- This means the original functions are called on all wrapped estimators - which can have various issues (namely we now need to dynamically set the tags of the composite classes so that when we call `fit()` on them we accept inputs. \r\n- The solution to this is to add some logic to `__init__`, and have a `reset()` function that is called at the start of each call to `fit()`. \r\n- The advantage of this approach is only the estimator actually in need of having a delegation ability is exposed to the delegation logic by inheriting from the mixin. \r\n\r\n##### Proposed new approach via the decorator (as it was implemented):\r\n- Add a decorator to all the main functions in `BaseEstimator` (eg `fit()`, `predict()` etc) which will delegate that function to the wrapped estimator if one is provided.\r\n- Add an attribute to store the name of the attribute storing the estimator these functions should be delegated to. Defaults to `None` so estimators that do not delegate should not be affected. \r\n- This approach has a disadvantage in that all `BaseEstimator`'s now have delegation logic attached to them even though many of them might not need it. \r\n- Because `fit()` is no longer being called on the \"main estimator\" we now no longer need to dynamically set tags, (at least not to get `fit()` to work).  This makes sense to me at least.\r\n- But because `fit()` is no longer called on the main estimator, we now need a way to copy over certain attributes to the main estimator (e.g. `_y`, `_fh`, `_is_fitted` and `_cutoff`), so we need an additional functionality in the decorator which takes care of copying over these attributes from the wrapped estimator to the main estimator.  - we keep track of the names of the estimator to copy over in a new attribute. \r\n\r\nNote, in my mind the main design advantages/disadvantages of each approach actually don't come from either using a delegator/mixin, but rather how each are implemented (in my mind). Taking this into account, I propose a hybrid solution: \r\n\r\n##### Hybrid Solution: \r\n- Use a mixin (Personally I think the mixin would work well here, as I think it is the easiest way to make sure only the classes which need delegation functionality get it.)\r\n- Give the mixin has an attribute called `_funcs_to_delegate` which will include the names of the functions to be delegated ie [`fit`, `predict`,...] etc.  This will be nice because certain functions might not want to delegate all functions (ie `BaseGridSearch` which for the most part is a great candidate for delegation doesn't actually work well if you delegate `fit()`, and having the ability to control which functions get delegated is useful.)\r\n- We will then use a decorator to wrap all these functions based on the function names provided. (@ltsaprounis has to do something similar in his mock estimator stuff/I like the way he did it so I would plan to do it similarly here). \r\n\r\nNote - this would stick with delegating the non-underscore classes, which I think is a good idea. We will then still need to copy over certain attributes from the fitted data to the wrapped estimator. (And I would probably do this in a similar way as I did before).

PR modifies `set_params` to also execute a full `reset`, which calls any `__init__` code such as dynamic tag setting.\r\n\r\nAlso adds parameter inspection related class methods to `BaseObject`:\r\n* `get_param_names` - retrieves list of parameter names\r\n* `get_param_defaults` - retrieves name/default dict of parameter defaults\r\n\r\nWhy `set_params` should execute a `reset`: @aiwalter pointed me to this specification document in `sklearn` which makes a key interface assumption explicit, namely that the result of `set_params` must be the same as `__init__(**self.get_params())`.\r\n\r\nSince `sktime` may have some `__init__` content besides `self` writes (in deviation from `sklearn` due to varia discussed in #2573), we can ensure consistency here by calling `reset` from `set_params`.\r\nThis relates to discussion in, and also partially addresses https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2573 .\r\n\r\nAs a secondary effect of this, the `test_set_params` test was failing in instances where parameter related logic was present in `__init__`, e.g., cloning estimators to `component_name_`, due to testing logic in `sklearn`'s `check_set_params` which was called from `test_set_params`. The reason for that is that `sklearn`'s test would overwrite parameters with `np.inf` etc to mimic a change, which is fine in `sklearn` since it strictly has no logic in `__init__`. However, `sktime` estimators may have logic, such as dynamic tag setting, which therefore would break the `set_params` now identical with `__init__`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the `test_set_params` test was changed from overwriting with `np.inf` etc, to overwriting with values from other test cases as available through `get_test_params` and `get_param_defaults` (needed for full set), which ensures validity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2835/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1160419905","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/2573#issuecomment-1160419905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2573","id":1160419905,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5FKppB","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-20T13:01:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-20T13:01:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"related
