forecasting performance metrics currently only cover a limited number of metrics discussed in the forecasting literature. \r\n\r\nI propose to add the metrics discussed in: [Another look at measures of forecast accuracy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207006000239), which has a nice discussion of different metrics for evaluating forecast accuracy. \r\n\r\nI also propose adding root mean squared scaled error, which is related to MASE and the forecast metric used in the [M5 Competition](https://mofc.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/M5-Competitors-Guide-Final-10-March-2020.docx) \r\n\r\nBeyond these performance metrics the availability of an asymmetric forecasting loss function is useful when forecasting errors in one direction have a higher cost than those in another direction.  I propose adding an asymmetric error function too. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes, I also propose two changes to make Sktime's performance metrics more compatible with Scikit-learn:\r\n\r\n- Scikit-learn adapted many (all?) of its regression metrics to handle multioutput regression problems. I propose providing this functionality for each of the forecasting metrics in the above resources so that compatability with Scikit-learn's metrics is maintained and so that the functionality exists if future multivariate forecasting functionality is added. \r\n- Scikit-learn's metrics write out the full name (e.g. mean_absolute_error) and I propose updating Sktime's forecasting performance metrics to do the same\r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n- relative_error\r\n- mean_asymmetric_error\r\n- mean_absolute_scaled_error\r\n- median_absolute_scaled_error\r\n- root_mean_squared_scaled_error\r\n-  mean_absolute_error\r\n-  mean_squared_error\r\n-  root_mean_squared_error\r\n-  median_absolute_error\r\n-  median_squared_error\r\n-  root_median_squared_error\r\n-  symmetric_mean_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  symmetric_median_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  mean_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  median_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  mean_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  median_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  root_mean_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  root_median_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  mean_relative_absolute_error\r\n-  median_relative_absolute_error\r\n-  geometric_mean_relative_absolute_error\r\n-  geometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n\r\nI've already started work on this and will start a draft pull request soon.
