They will NOT forecast values they have not seen. So the airlines dataset is an extremely bad example since it has a trend. You need to do decomposition to get useful forecasts, read the article.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. The sample article is great for LightGBM. Interestingly, I am planning to use the same dataset. In his example, he limited the use to just 1 store because if you include all stores then there will be date duplicates. That is going to impact the forecast horizon. Because, I am going to use Test Dataset index (date) as my forecast horizon for testing purposes. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to handle this in SkTime ? Such as combine date with store and item id and use it as dataframe index ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1314484972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nyk2001","id":3079053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzkwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3079053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001","html_url":"https://github.com/nyk2001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1314520115","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3784#issuecomment-1314520115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3784","id":1314520115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5OWfwz","user":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-14T23:03:38Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T23:03:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime-tutorial-pydata-berlin-2022/blob/main/notebooks/3_hierarchical_global_forecasting.ipynb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1314520115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1314681939","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3784#issuecomment-1314681939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3784","id":1314681939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5OXHRT","user":{"login":"nyk2001","id":3079053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzkwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3079053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001","html_url":"https://github.com/nyk2001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyk2001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T02:38:59Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T02:55:
