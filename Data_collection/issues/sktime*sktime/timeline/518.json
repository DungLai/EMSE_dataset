Thank for your patience while explaining these to me (and the other issues that I have opened). \r\n\r\n> the `window_length=False` is needed for model evaluation in forecasting update_predict based on some test data, where the first is the training data seen in fit and the subsequent windows add more data step by step.\r\n\r\nDid you mean `start_with_window=False` instead of window_length=False?\r\n\r\nMy main concern stems from the example in the forecasting notebook. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\r\n\r\n# tuning the 'n_estimator' hyperparameter of RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn\r\nregressor_param_grid = {\"n_estimators\": [100, 200, 300]}\r\nforecaster_param_grid = {\"window_length\": [5,10,15,20,25]}\r\n\r\n# create a tunnable regressor with GridSearchCV\r\nregressor = GridSearchCV(RandomForestRegressor(), param_grid=regressor_param_grid)\r\nforecaster = ReducedRegressionForecaster(regressor, window_length=15, strategy=\"recursive\")\r\n\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(initial_window=int(len(y_train) * 0.5))\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(forecaster, cv=cv, param_grid=forecaster_param_grid)\r\n\r\ngscv.fit(y_train)\r\ny_pred = gscv.predict(fh)\r\nplot_series(y_train, y_test, y_pred, labels=[\"y_train\", \"y_test\", \"y_pred\"]);\r\nsmape_loss(y_test, y_pred)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the default value for `start_with_window` is False in `SlidingWindowSplitter`. After the fitting has been done on the initial window, would the RandomForestRegressor not expect to have the same amount of features in X in each fold when doing temporal cross validation? But with `start_with_window` = False, the training window is expanding (not uniform size) for the first 19 folds in my original example (first post) . I would think that would cause an issue.\r\n\r\nMaybe I don't understand the inner working completely yet, so I appreciate it if you can shed some more light on this. \r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/737480037/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4064274714,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA2NDI3NDcxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4064274714","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-02T20:34:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4064274720,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwNjQyNzQ3MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4064274720","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-02T20:34:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/737480709","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/518#issuecomment-737480709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/518","id":737480709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNzQ4MDcwOQ==","user":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-02T20:36:20Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T20:36:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

@mloning @fkiraly @aiwalter @ngupta23\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm trying to migrate my codebase from `statsmodels` and `pmdarima` to `sktime`. There are some nuances that I have noticed:\r\n\r\n1. There is absolutely no difference between using `SlidingWindowSplitter` and `ExpandingWindowSplitter` when pass them to `ForecastingGridSearchCV`. New data is appended to `self._y` and `self._X` according to the selected splitter strategy (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/552#issuecomment-748685565, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/520#issuecomment-737325145), but: \r\n    - Training folds are still the same for both splitters.\r\n    - Training folds become larger and larger. It's OK for `ExpandingWindowSplitter`, but not for `SlidingWindowSplitter`. For `SlidingWindowSplitter`'s training folds should have the same length and move forward step by step and forget the earliest data points.\r\n\r\n2. I believe that `initial_window` and `start_with_window` parameters can be avoided in splitter classes to make them easier to understand (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/521, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/518). For example, I suggest the following signatures:\r\n    - `SlidingWindowSplitter(window_length, fh, step_length)`: fixed size training windows\r\n    - `ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_window_length, fh, step_length)`: expanding training windows\r\n\r\n    As you can see I was inspired by `pmdarima.model_selection`'s classes `SlidingWindowForecastCV` and `RollingForecastCV`.\r\n\r\n3. `ForecastingGridSearchCV` doesn't support a multi-step forecasting horizon (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/633).\r\n\r\n4. Also, it's good to add `cross_val_score` function in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection` that returns scores for each train/test folds. I found @aiwalter's evaluate function very similar to what I mean (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/657).\r\n\r\n5. The final suggestion is about update vs refit trade-off.\r\n    - For sliding window setting when the training fold has a fixed length there is only one option - call refit.\r\n    - For expanding window setting, from my point of view, the better approach is to use update functionality and refit as a fall-back option.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any of my suggestions sound interesting to you.
