is a merge/review ready sketch for how multivariate `y` could be supported for multivariate forecasters, alongside the possibility to pass `np.array` and `pd.Series`. This is based on the design in [STEP no.5](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/tree/main/steps/05_scitype_based_IO_checks), adapted to the new forecasting base class.\r\n\r\nThe key ingredient are:\r\n\r\n* converters parameterized by from, to, and as - in the `convertIO`module. Besides the obvious conversion functionality, the converters can be given access to a dictionary via reference in the `store` argument, where information for inverting lossy conversions (like from `pd.DataFrame` to `np.array`) can be stored\r\n* a new tag `y_type` which encodes the type of `y` that the private `_fit`, `_predict`, and `_update` assume internally - for now, it's just one type and not a list of compatible types\r\n* some logic in the public \"plumbing\" area of `fit`, `predict`, `update`, which converts inputs to the public layer to the desired input of the logic layer and back\r\n\r\nThis is for discussion, and I expect major change before we merge.\r\n\r\nIt might be especially interesting to discuss the following interaction with typing:\r\nthe third argument of the converter, the \"as\" argument, is a scitype, and designed to have the same name as the respective `typing` composite type. Also see discussion in #965, #973 and #974.\r\n\r\nThinking of the logical continuation of this:\r\n\r\n* extend this to the other arguments, e.g., `X`\r\n* the individual argument checks like `check_X` etc should be replaced by checks of the kind `check(what, as : scitype)`, e.g., `check(y, \"Series\")` should replace the less generic `check_y`.\r\n* extend this to time series classification, to support 3D numpy arrays, awkward arrays, nested data frames\r\n\r\nA \"visionary\" pathway may see this working with type annotations that are scitypes, not `typing` machine types, e.g.,\r\n```python\r\nfit(X : Series, Y : Series)\r\netc\r\n_fit(X: Series, Y : UnivariateSeries)\r\n```\r\nand checks/conversions being done automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4913577346,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDkxMzU3NzM0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4913577346","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-20T16:37:23Z","label":{"name":"good

@ABostrom, @chrisholder, @jambo6, @TonyBagnall, @aiwalter, @mloning, I wanted to hear your opinion on a suggestion how to deal with descriptive type hints and type checks in one.\r\n\r\nWhat I would propose is that our base class `fit` etc look like as follows (below without conversion etc), in the example of the forecaster base class:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n@scitype_decorator\r\ndef fit(X: Series, Y: Series):\r\n    \r\n    X = check(X)\r\n    Y = check(Y)\r\n\r\n    stuff(X,Y)\r\n\r\n    self._fit(X.inner, Y.inner)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout the ingredients above:\r\n* `Series` is a custom type, or perhaps better class that denotes `scitype`, not machine type\r\n* what `scitype_decorator` does is wrap `X` and `Y` in the declarative type (ligh-weight wrapper), and does part of what `check_series` does now: it annotates `X`, `Y`, with the machine type. E.g.,: `X = Series(X)`, which moves `X` to `X.inner` and adds an `X.scitype = \"Series\"` attribute\r\n* `check` inspects `X` for validity, and adds a `X.scitype = \"DataFrame\"` or similar annotation. So after `check`, we know that `X` is valid, and we can read the scitype and the mtype using `X.scitype` and `X.mtype`.\r\n* the remaining `stuff` has access to these declarative type annotations. It could be compatibility checks, conversions, etc.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstandings:\r\n* we don't expect the user to wrap `X` and `Y` in `Series` already. They can pass a `pd.DataFrame` or `pd.Series` or whatever they like. The type hint is to be read like the union type roughly. The wrapping happens in the decorator.\r\n\r\nThis proposal has some advantages:\r\n\r\n* type annotation in the base class and the user docstrings will be with the \"scientific type\"\r\n* the scientific type of any object is inspectable, per declarative annotation\r\n* we have a consistent way, across modules, to track and inspect alias mtypes for the same scitype\r\n* this could be eaily

decrator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/869641023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisholder","id":4674372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4674372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisholder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4947109018,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk0NzEwOTAxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4947109018","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-28T12:25:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4947109024,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5NDcxMDkwMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4947109024","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-28T12:25:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/869994289","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/973#issuecomment-869994289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/973","id":869994289,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTk5NDI4OQ==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T20:02:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T20:02:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">
