PR implements defaults for `_predict_interval` and `_predict_quantiles`, as proposed in #1877 - for discussion (not necessarily as final version). This does not yet contain defaults in terms of `_predict_proba`, since we have not settled on output format yet.\r\n\r\nIt is partly based on work in @k1m190r's PR #1842 and @kejsitake in #1579, behaviour moved to base class default implementations.\r\n\r\nBehaviour implemented:\r\n* if `_predict_interval`  is not implemented but `_predict_quantiles` is, it is called and outputs are reformatted\r\n* if `_predict_quantiles`  is not implemented but `_predict_interval` is, it is called and outputs are reformatted\r\n* the check whether sth is implemented is done by a utility added to `BaseObject`, a method `_has_implementation_of`, which is based on @k1m190r's utility that checks whether the forecaster has been refactored, which was based on @kejsitake's and some discussion between the three of us.\r\n\r\nFurther, the following forecasters were relying primarily on `_predict_quantiles` but interfacing interval prediction logic. This has been changed by tidying up the interface, implementing a leaner `_predict_interval`, and removing `_predict_quantiles`:\r\n* `_PmdArimaAdapter`\r\n* `_TbatsAdapter`\r\n* `_ProphetAdapter`\r\n\r\nAdditional, minor changes:\r\n* docstring fixes in `BaseForecaster`\r\n* multiple minor instances of clean-up in the forecasting extension template\r\n* shortened `ThetaForecaster` internals\r\n* fix for bug in `ThetaForecaster`, where intervals were computed for 1-coverage, not coverage. Same in test for `ThetaForecaster`.\r\n* fix for bug #1954 in `_ProphetAdapter`\r\n* renamed `test_predict_pred_interval` to `test_predict_interval` for consistency with `test_predict_quantiles`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-28T22:21:48Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T22:21:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1953","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1953/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1953/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1953/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/1953","id":1117666874,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc4xwBeE","number":1953,"title":"Temporary
