been trying to set up a sktime developer environment in my day job role, we have a standard hardware set-up that uses Windows laptops.\r\nUnlike the unix/mac experience which seems smooth, I truly

complete the `sktime` developer set-up without any hassle.\r\n\r\nSo, we've decided to help by fixing this, with @eenticott-shell, @amrith-shell, by:\r\n\r\n- [x] updating and validating the installation instructions in windows. Related issue: #1372, #1203\r\n- [x] completing and re-organizing the developer guide (currently mostly empty!) and the \"how to contribute\" page.
