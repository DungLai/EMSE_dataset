some of this was one of the things fixed in the transformers refactor, #1365.\r\nOriginally, we were going to allow only 2D numpy, but decided to relax to 1D numpy\r\nWith it merged, the checks for 1D now work properly, here;s the relevant bullet point:\r\n\r\n> relaxing np.ndarray mtype for Series so 1D numpy arrays are also allowed (and considered univariate series or vector). This is required since some tests use univariate numpy arrays as label vectors.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, there was another genuine bug (thanks for reporting!), namely:\r\n`_split` and `convert` would break since both were calling `pandas` constructors for `Series` and `Index` with 2D `np.ndarray` which can break, depending on `pandas` version. Similar to problems I believe we have with older `pandas` version.\r\nI fixed this by adding a `flatten` in the right places.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/979837533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5676680534,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc4_bk05zwAAAAFSW0VW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5676680534","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-26T09:55:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5676680539,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc4_bk05zwAAAAFSW0Vb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5676680539","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-26T09:55:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/980529521","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1649#issuecomment-980529521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1649","id":980529521,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc46cbFx","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-27T09:15:24Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T09:18:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Update is also broken?
