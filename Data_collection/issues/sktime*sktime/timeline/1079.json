Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #1079\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAdds the possibility to define the required \"cap\" and \"floor\" parameters for Prophet when its growth is set to logistic.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nWhether the proposed changes are the correct way of accepting the cap and floor parameters. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the only check in place is a ValueError is currently raised when \"cap\" is not specified (\"floor\" is not required, as it defaults to 0). I believe Prophet will handle all other input errors, but it might be good to test certain wrong inputs.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nThis fix is blocked by another uncovered bug in the `convert_to` method that is used in the BaseForecaster, that leads to the output as an empty DataFrame. Will open another issue for this\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of

the bug**\r\nProphet allows logistic grown capacity and/ or floor to be either scalar or array. While fixing #1079 noticed that when set to array fit does the job but predict fails, as it attempts to reuse the same `cap` and `floor` params. `predict` expects `cap` and `floor` to be same length as `fh` and thus will need to passed into `predict`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.fbprophet import Prophet\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\ny = y.to_timestamp(freq=\"M\")\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=36)\r\n\r\ny_train_df = pd.DataFrame(y_train)\r\ny_train_df.columns = [\"y\"]\r\ny_train_df[\"cap\"] = 1000\r\n\r\ncap = np.full_like(y_train_df[\"y\"], 1000)\r\n\r\nforecaster = Prophet(growth=\"logistic\", growth_cap=cap)\r\n\r\nforecaster.fit(y_train_df)\r\n\r\ny_pred = forecaster.predict([1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\ny_pred with valid values.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nonly fails if cap is array.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll continue looking into this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
