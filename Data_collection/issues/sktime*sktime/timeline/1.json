1. General design.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe design supports a low-level interface which is a direct generalization of sklearn's supervised estimators, and a high-level interface which is more reminiscent of mlr's or openML's task/solution pattern. This allows two user interaction patterns:\r\n\r\nlow-level: data <--> estimator\r\nhigh-level: data <--> task <--> strategy <--> estimator\r\n\r\nThe \"strategy\" class is a visitor to the estimator class. It is similar to the mlaut estimator and visits the scikit-learn-like estimator to provide meta-data, parameter, and task abstraction functionality.\r\n\r\nThe low-level interface should be implemented first; the high-level interface seems necessary for benchmark orchestration.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment/criticize.

Strategy\r\n\r\nStrategy should be a *class* with (public) parameters, (private) attributes and (public) methods.\r\nUses abstract base class. Does *not* inherit from sklearn BaseEstimator or a descedant, and eventually should have its own visitor inheritance tree (if more use cases become implemented).\r\n\r\nComment: this mirrors \"mlaut_estimator\", so maybe @ViktorKaz may like to comment on this.\r\n\r\nParameters:\r\nhostestimator - pointer to visited estimator, of class TSXestimator\r\nmetadata - dictionary of strategy properties.\r\nFor TSC/TSR, implements at least:\r\n- a \"tasktype\" field, which contains a single string or a string list containing \"TSR\" and/or \"TSC\"\r\n- a \"tags\" field, which contains a multi-set dictionary, e.g., \"methodclass -> distance-based\" or \"package -> keras\" or \"UEA favourite\" etc\r\n\r\nAttributes:\r\ntask - set by the fit method\r\n\r\nConstructor _ _ init _ _\r\narguments: all parameters of hostestimator, explicitly, with sensible default setting.\r\nbehavior: constructs and initializes the host estimator. Especially useful if host estimator is a composite strategy (e.g., sklearn pipeline).\r\n\r\npublic method fit\r\narguments:\r\ntask - a task object compatible to estimator\r\noptional argument:\r\ndata - if task's data pointer is empty, figures as data reference passed here\r\nbehavior:\r\ncalls estimator's fit after unwrapping data and task specs. Stores pointer to task in task attribute.\r\nDoes *not* modify task.\r\n\r\npublic method predict\r\narguments:\r\n*none*. Task and data reference should be stored as attribute and accessible there.\r\nbehavior:\r\nCalls hostestimator's predict after unwrapping parameters, ad returns its output. May access, but may not modify hostestimator or task.\r\n\r\nset_params\r\ncalls hostestimator's set_params verbatim, has same arguments\r\n\r\nget_params\r\ncalls hostestimator's get_params verbatim, has same arguments\r\nIn addition to value dictionary, also returns a dictionary of types (may have to be implemented inside get_params)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/452009295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2058145084,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA1ODE0NTA4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2058145084","actor":{"login":"ViktorKaz","id":33499138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33499138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz","html_url":"https://github.com/ViktorKaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-07T17:14:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2058145087,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNTgxNDUwODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2058145087","actor":{"login":"ViktorKaz","id":33499138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33499138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz","html_url":"https://github.com/ViktorKaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-07T17:14:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/452009981","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1#issuecomment-452009981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1","id":452009981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjAwOTk4MQ==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-07T17:16:55Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T17:16:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Done,
