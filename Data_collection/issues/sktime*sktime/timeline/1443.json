I think it is an interesting concept and I'm generally supportive of it. But what's a concrete use case? \r\n\r\nThe example (which I know is just for illustrative purposes), adds a scaled version of the input data exeogenous data (minmaxscalar), it doesn't seem like that would add value in AutoArima (since I believe it is performing regression with ARIMA error structure when there is exogenous data). \r\n\r\nWould be good to have a specific example that could be used

the solution you'd like**\r\nI would to forecast time series data using scikit learn regressors with moving average smoothing. Currently, sktime module supports lagged time series component (window_length) which is specified in make_reduction method. It would be of great value, if this method supports moving average smoothing (backward rolling window) for target time series. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternative solution is to use ARIMA, because it supports both Auto Regressive component (lags) and Moving Average component (Smoothing). But it is not as good as GBT algorithm.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI understand that tsfresh provides tools to extract features but this process takes a lot more time to compute the features.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-05T14:29:07Z","updated_at":"2021-11-05T14:29:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/220","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/220/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/220/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/220/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/220","id":556192562,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTYxOTI1NjI=","number":220,"title":"Forecasting

implement some dunder methods for forecaster and transformer composites (and, possibly, discuss design):\r\n\r\n- [ ] `**` for applying a transformer to `X` into a forecaster, via `ForecastingPipeline`\r\n- [ ]  `-` for `OptionalPassthrough` applied to a transformer\r\n- [x] `|` for `MultiplexForecaster`\r\n- [x] implement `MultiplexTransformer`\r\n- [x] `|` for `MultiplexTransformer`\r\n\r\nI should also mention existing constructs of the same kind, where we can look at (and possibly modify) existing design, and where we need to think about interactions:\r\n\r\n* `*` tor chaining transformers, in a `TransformerPipeline`\r\n* `+` for parallel application and output concatenation of transformers, in `FeatureUnion`\r\n* `*` for chaining transformers to a classifier, in `ClassifierPipeline`\r\n* `*` for applying transformers to input `y` and forecasting output of a forecaster, via `TransformedTargetForecaster`\r\n\r\nOne of the core design ideas for the dunders is to avoid having users search for the \"right class\", instead we want to use the parsing design pattern to create the right compositor class (or nested structure thereof).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
