**Is your feature request related to a problem?

`ColumnEnsembleForecaster` but instead of applying a different univariate forecaster per-column, it applies a different univariate forecaster per-level on panel-type data\r\n> \r\n> **Describe

for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nFixes #2764 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nHierarchyEnsembleForecaster() aggregates panel-type data and applies different univariate forecasters on the aggregated data by each hierarchical level/node. For aggregation, it employs sktime's bulit-in 'Aggregator' class. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here \r\n-->\r\nA reviewer should concentrate their feedback on the forecaster's ability to :- \r\n- [ ] Fit a separate forecaster on each hierarchical level of the panel/hierarchical data, with and without exogenous data.\r\n- [ ] Fit a separate forecaster on each hierarchical node of the panel/hierarchical data, with and without exogenous data.\r\n- [ ] Fit a 'default' forecaster (if passed as argument) on nodes/levels not mentioned in the 'forecasters' argument.\r\n- [ ] Make predictions by each hierarchical level of the fitted aggregated panel data.\r\n- [ ] Make predictions by each hierarchical node of the fitted aggregated panel data.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
