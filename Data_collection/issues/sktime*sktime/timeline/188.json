The manylinux idea uses an old CentOS6 linux install to build a wheel which is compatible with most linux distros today as they all inherit off of CentOS6 (afaik, may be wrong!). Either way, CentOS6 is generic enough.\r\n\r\nI'm currently trying to mirror [this demo](https://github.com/pypa/python-manylinux-demo) in sktime, but the build install script is rather odd. I'm not sure whether the OSX entry in travis is going to play well with this, we'll need to heavily adjust the demo I think.

few useful change to improve our release/distribution cycle:\r\n\r\n- [x] compile manylinux wheels (see #188)\r\n- [x] set up CI to directly upload wheels to PyPI\r\n- [x] include Makefile to automise release workflow (see this [intro](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/make/make.html), also see e.g. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CleverCSV/blob/master/make_release.py)\r\n- [x] enforce code formatting in released code (see #208, #256)\r\n- [x] add coverage for unit tests (see #394)\r\n- [ ] add code quality/climate checks (see https://lgtm.com, https://www.codacy.com, https://github.com/marketplace/code-climate, etc)\r\n- [ ] consider [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/tree/master/cibuildwheel) package to simplify wheel building across platforms\r\n- [ ] improve packaging for macOS wheels with [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate), also included in cibuildwheel, also see https://iscinumpy.gitlab.io/post/azure-devops-python-wheels/ \r\n- [x] distribute sktime via conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/#contribute (see #326)\r\n- [x] set up [pre-commit config](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/) (see #394)\r\n- [x] add Black for code formatting (see #394)\r\n- [x] add [check-manifest](https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/) (see #394)\r\n- [x] add [bugbear](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-bugbear/) to flake8 (see #394)\r\n- [x] update setup.cfg, see e.g. https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram/blob/develop/setup.cfg (see #394)\r\n- [ ] check out other [flake8 extensions](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions)\r\n- [ ] add checks for broken website links: https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastlinkcheck/\r\n- [ ] use GitHub Action to check if Binder works and pre-build Docker images for quicker launch: https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action#use-github-actions-to-cache-the-build-for-binderhub \r\n- [ ] explore [pre-commit-ci](https://pre-commit.ci) as suggested in #794 \r\n\r\n#### Extra resources\r\n* For building/distribution on GitHub Actions checkout: https://scikit-hep.org/developer/gha_wheels\r\n* Useful links from [reproducible research lunch](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/746)  \r\n* scikit-learn's [release process](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/maintainer.html) \r\n* Check out https://python-poetry.org thanks to @hiqbal2\r\n* Consider [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) for versioning (software configuration

Explain your changes.\r\nDockerfile added. Jupyter notebook time_series_classification added. \r\n\r\nREADME.rst provides instructions for building the Docker image and then using it to either run the tests or to install the local sktime-dl project and then launch Jupyter.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nDraft pull request: I will add more text to the notebook, a regression and a multivariate classifier.\r\n\r\nThis was the best way I found to enable local sktime-dl to be installed in the Jupyter environment. Even so, it only works for notebooks that are saved at the top folder level (hence the Dockerfile ```COPY examples/time_series_classification.ipynb .```).
