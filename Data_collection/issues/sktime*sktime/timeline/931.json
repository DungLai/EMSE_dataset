You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments.

is a feature suggestion arising from discussion in #877, #931, #942.\r\n\r\nI suggest two new/refactored interface points:\r\n* `summary` which is attached to `BaseObject` (as in post-merge #877)\r\n* `get_fitted_params` which is attached to `sktime`'s (not `scikit-learn`'s) `BaseEstimator`\r\n\r\nUpdate: it is probably better than the more convoluted suggestion below if the returns of both are `dict` and behave just like `get_params`. Any logic for retrieval should be provided in there, or a private version `_get_fitted_params`, rather than in \"populate\" functions.\r\n \r\n---\r\nOld API suggestion\r\n\r\nBoth should behave precisely like `scikit-learn`'s `get_params`, except that parameters are looked up in dedicated dictionaries `reports` and `fitted_params` rather than in self-attributes that correspond to `__init__` named arguments.\r\n\r\n`fit` or `__init__` could populate these dictionaries, this could happen by `_populate_fitted_params` and `_populate_summary` private interfaces called at the end of `fit` (the non-private with the \"plumbing\" logic), which is specific to individual estimators/objects, or directly in `_fit` (not sure which is the better convention?).\r\n\r\nFor functionality, I think we can copy-paste `scikit-learn`'s `get_params` code here, and adapt it by making the change in where parameters are being retrieved. This would ensure nested access, which for example `get_fitted_params` doesn't have at current.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n@mloning, @aiwalter, @RNKuhns, @ltsaprounis","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4919382829,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDkxOTM4MjgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4919382829","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-21T22:20:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
