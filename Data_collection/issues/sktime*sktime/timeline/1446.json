sktimers\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently it seems there is no native solution to, given a sliding window N x T, make predictions that at each time step provide N values (vector forecasting). At least I could not find it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI think we could include a native way to work with models that allow input matrices and output vectors.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA possible ``hack`` could be to have a single regressor for each of features in the multidimensional timeseries and join the outputs. Nevertheless, this does not take into account any correlation between the different input feature and output features.\r\n\r\nI am willing to help, and moreover, we could try to think for a high level abstraction that could also be applied to
