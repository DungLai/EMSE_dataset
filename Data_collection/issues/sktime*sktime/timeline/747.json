So TuningTransformer seems to do what passthrough from sklearn is meant for. If I get TransformedTargetForecaster running with passthrough, we probably wont need to have this transformer.\r\n\r\nI think your proposal is preferrable, in terms of functionality, usability and design:\r\n* I don't think the `passthrough` formalism works the way your functionality is intended (or it's more cumbersome to implement your desired functionality).\r\nThis is because in `sklearn`'s interface, you have to replace the *estimator* with the string `passthrough`, so it appears as a component in the list, not as a directly indexable hyper-parameter that you can use in grid search, as far as I understand? At least, it seems to be substantially more complicated to set up the desired grid.\r\n(assuming I understand correctly how it's used in `sklearn`, which seems mostly undocumented)\r\n* the `sklearn` design attaches the \"optionality\" parameter to the pipeline (one specific compositor), while you are attaching it to the component. The latter is more general, since it allows for the parameter in any compositor/reducer, rather than just in the pipeline. Implementing \"passthrough\" in every compositor/reducer is most definitely the more cumbersome and duplicative choice, compared to having a single wrapper.\r\n* It also seems more natural from a mathematical (domain driven) design perspective, since it's primarily the wrapped component you're making optional, not the place where it goes in the

not sure if I understood this. I think generally `MultiplexForecaster` is about finding the best forecaster whereas OptionalPassthrough will be used to find the best combination of multiple transformers together with a forecaster inside a `TransformedTargetForecaster`. \r\n\r\nMaybe it helps to show what I am doing in model tuning all together. I am using the following steps and components:\r\n\r\n1. different multiple forecasters (number = `n_forecasters`)\r\n2. multiple transformers (number = `n_transformers`)\r\n3. For 1 and 2 I create a `TransformedTargetForecaster` for each forecaster in `n_forecasters` together with all `n_transformers`. In future I will use `OptionalPassthrough` for each transformer. So in the end I will get `n_transformedtargetforecasters`\r\n4. Then I create a `ForecastingGridSearchCV` for each element in `n_transformedtargetforecasters `and append it to a list of grid searches called `n_gridsearches`\r\n5. Then I take the list `n_gridsearches` and give it to `MultiplexForecaster`\r\n6. This multiplexer is now finally given to another `ForecastingGridSearchCV` and I train it to get the overall best hyperparameters and implicite hyperparameters.\r\n\r\nIts a bit a nested approach, but works well so far. So this also describes a bit the relationship of `MultiplexForecaster` and the new class `OptionalPassthrough` hopefully. \r\n___\r\nMartin Walter <martin_friedrich.walter@daimler.com>, Mercedes-Benz AG on behalf of Daimler TSS GmbH.\r\nhttps://github.com/Daimler/daimler-foss/blob/master/LEGAL_IMPRINT.md\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/809680260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
