Please describe.**\r\nRelated issues: #1032 #1505 https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/421\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI've sketched out a possible solution here: https://github.com/mloning/minimal-python-project-portable-pytest\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n* collect estimator tests in classes, one class for the `BaseEstimator` and one for each scitype \r\n* define test classes discoverable by pytest, inheriting from collection classes, possibly using multiple inheritance\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n* add `configure_get_estimators` so that it can be easily reused/configured in companion packages \r\n* rename `all_estimators` to `get_estimators` for readability\r\n* rename `estimator_instance` to `estimator_object` in line with common class/object distinction and avoiding ambiguity with \"instance\" as an i.i.d. data sample \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* If we use multiple inheritance for the class that collects the tests, we need to make sure that the parent classes have unique method names to avoid overriding methods\r\n* There still is a lot of duplication  in https://github.com/mloning/minimal-python-project-portable-pytest between the base package and companion package, especially regarding `configure_pytest_generate_tests`

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
