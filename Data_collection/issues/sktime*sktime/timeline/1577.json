- I was wondering whether there is already a way to do this.\r\n\r\nThe generic way would be something like a `SmoothingReducer(base_estimator, smoother_estimator)`.\r\n\r\nThis does the following in `predict`:\r\n\r\n1. forecast time points `1...max(fh)` using `base _estimator`, this gives a series `x(0) ... x(t) ... x(t+maxfh)` made up of actuals and forecasts\r\n2. using `smoother_estimator`, produce forecasts `z(i)` for all `i` in `fh` from `x(0),...,x(i-1)` using `update_predict`, always one-step ahead\r\n3. the forecast are the `z(i)` for `i` in `fh`\r\n\r\nIn `fit`, the `smoother_estimator` is trained on `y` (observed) to make one-stepahead forecasts.\r\n\r\nWhat you want would be `SmoothingReducer(my_reduced_regressor_estimator, ARMA(p=0, q=my_q))`,

Thanks for summarizing my thoughts. This is exactly what I am looking for. Temperature have a lagged effect on load curve, and also in case of wind power forecasting (wind farm), wind speed tend to have a lagged effect on the wind power. To address this, I can create lags and aggregates on wind speed or outdoor temperature. But it is not possible for me to create aggregate on target series (load curve or wind power) that I am trying to forecast.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/958803282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dwarak-PCI","id":83296198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjk2MTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83296198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI","html_url":"https://github.com/Dwarak-PCI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dwarak-PCI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5560737145,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc4-IT0-zwAAAAFLch15","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5560737145","actor":{"login":"LoicRaillon","id":37119601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTE5NjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37119601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon","html_url":"https://github.com/LoicRaillon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-03T10:03:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5560737150,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc4-IT0-zwAAAAFLch1-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5560737150","actor":{"login":"LoicRaillon","id":37119601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTE5NjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37119601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon","html_url":"https://github.com/LoicRaillon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoicRaillon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-03T10:03:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/959360747","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1577#issuecomment-959360747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1577","id":959360747,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc45Lq7r","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T15:03:06Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T15:03:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">
