`utils._testing.scenarions_transformers` (note, you have to set the `is_enabled` flag to ensure it is run as part of the test suite).\r\n\r\nPerhaps change one of the existing examples to have multi-level, in order to avoid increasing runtime of tests (we need to check in both `X` and `y`)\r\n\r\n(see here for more information on the testing framework:

Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nAdd supports for multi-level columns to ColumnEnsembleForecaster\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nI added changes on three places; check forecasters which ensures all columns are forecasted, coerce_to_pd_index and the way forecasts are combined.\r\nChanges are minimal but I guess it can still be made better. This is mainly to show what is needed.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are.
