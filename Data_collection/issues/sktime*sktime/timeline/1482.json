blocked by: \r\n- [x] #1644\r\n- [x] #1661\r\n- [x] #1662 \r\n- [x] #1792\r\n- [x] #1747\r\n- [x] #1783\r\n- [x] #1803\r\n- [x] update installation instructions in [docs/source/installation.rst](docs/source/installation.rst)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather substantial effort involving changes to how `sktime` is build and distributed. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n-  Add [pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) (see [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) and [PEP 633](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0633/)]. The intention behind is to collect all package matadata and dependencies in one place.\r\n- Add sets of optional dependencies:\r\n    - `all_extras` all \"soft\" dependencies\r\n    - `dev` packages useful for development and testing\r\n    - `binder` packages required for binder and running notebook examples\r\n    - `docs` packages required to build the documentation\r\n- Add section to build time dependencies.\r\n- Refactor existing CI/CD pipelines to use the new build configuration.\r\n- Introduced a new CI/CD pipelines for running tests across win, mac, linux and py37, py38, py39 with github actions.\r\n- Removed the obsolete requirements files.\r\n- Include wheels build for macosx on arm64.\r\n\r\n**Removed**\r\n\r\n- ❌ Drop support for python3.6\r\n- ❌ Drop appveyor and azure pipelines\r\n\r\n**High level diagram for the CI/CD workflows**\r\n\r\n![sktime-cicd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989838/149678967-309054eb-e91e-4988-a6cf-321de0108eb8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nIt does not introduce any new runtime/install dependencies but it could introduce an optional development depencency/build system such as [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to simplify development/build/distribution.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changed to the CI/CD pipelines that would hopefully allow to drop ``appveyor`` and ``azure pipelines`` in favor of ``github actions`` which would simplify the current build and maintenance process.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/972872980","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1482#issuecomment-972872980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1482","id":972872980,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc45_N0U","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-18T13:37:27Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T13:37:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks

spent some time looking at the CI/CD pipelines and I I think it might be a little too complex for what it does.\r\n\r\nHere is what I learned:\r\n\r\n#### github actions\r\n\r\n- [.github/workflows/assign-contributor.yml](.github/workflows/assign-contributor.yml)\r\n- [.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml)\r\n    - ``code-quality`` linting, style, format\r\n    - ``test-examples`` run all the example notebooks\r\n    - ``build`` build wheels for ``macos-10.15`` and python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and run test on the wheels\r\n- [.github/workflows/upload-to-pypi.yml](.github/workflows/upload-to-pypi.yml)\r\n    - ``deploy`` build wheels for ``macos-10.15`` and python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, run test on the wheels and publish to PyPI\r\n\r\n#### azure pipelines\r\n\r\n- [build_tools/azure/build_manylinux_wheels.yml](build_tools/azure/build_manylinux_wheels.yml) build linux wheels \r\n- [build_tools/azure/publish.yml](build_tools/azure/publish.yml) upload wheels to azure \r\n\r\n#### appveyor\r\n\r\n- [build_tools/appveyor/run_with_env.cmd](build_tools/appveyor/run_with_env.cmd) build wheels for win?\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to propose is to simplify the pipelines \r\n\r\n- try to run all on github actions since it support the [main os hosts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)\r\n- use [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel) to build wheels across the matrix of ``win``, ``linux``, ``mac`` and python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\r\n- publish to PyPI\r\n\r\nI'll be working on a draft in #1620 \r\n\r\nIs there any reason or information that I'm missing  that it would not work?
