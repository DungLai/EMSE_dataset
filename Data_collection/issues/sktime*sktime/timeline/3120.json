the bug**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n-->\r\n- Sklearn's `clone()` function is not working correctly on `ExpandingWindowSplitter`\r\n- The `window_length` parameter is not copied\r\n- `initial_window` is copied into `window_length` which is fine according to docstrings, however is counterintuitive and incompatible with `clone()`\r\n- This generates problems when cloning models that have cross-validation embeded\r\n- Example: `MultiplexForecaster` combined with `ForecastingGridSearchCV` cannot be evaluated using sktime's `evaluate()`\r\n\r\n**To

PR fixes the non-conformance with `sklearn` specs in the `ExpandingWindowSplitter` constructor reported in #3119.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `ExpandingWindowSplitter` calls its parent constructor, of `BaseWindowSplitter`, with certain parameter names switched. This has the effect of overwriting `self.initial_window` with a value that is in general not equal to that passed to the constructor, which breaks the `sklearn` constructor interface expectation.\r\n\r\nThe solution is as follows:\r\n\r\n* `BaseWindowSplitter` internally now accesses a property `self._initial_window` wherever it previously accessed `self.initial_window`\r\n* that property reads from `self.initial_window` if exists, otherwise returne `None`\r\n* `ExpandingWindowSplitter` overrides the property, and does not overwrite `self.inital_window`, which fixes the interface conformance while retaining the patterns used\r\n\r\nTests are not being added here, they are in a separate PR #3122 which includes this PR, and they are verified to catch this issue.\r\n\r\nWhy: this is an instance of #3120 which should be addressed systemically, doing otherwise would proliferate sporadic test cases that are already covered in the framework.\r\nThe corresponding PR #3122 adds tests for all `BaseObject` descendants, and which also catches the `ExpandingWindowSplitter` issue (verified).\r\n\r\nI have also manually verified that the example provided in #3119 now gives the expected results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-28T14:48:25Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T14:48:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3122","id":1321053262,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCVKAsc48QZX0","number":3122,"title":"[ENH]

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/3120 by ensuring that all `BaseObject` descendants are tested for `sklearn` compatibility.\r\n\r\nApproach is adding `BaseObject` to the base class registry, and splitting off a class `TestAllObjects` from `TestAllEstimators`.\r\n\r\nSecondary changes needed for this:\r\n* `check_estimator` to be adapted to the split\r\n* base class strings added in registry for `\"estimator\"` and `\"object\"`\r\n* `scitype` function modified to return most specific scitype (e.g., exclude `\"object\"` from returns if inherits from subclass)\r\n\r\nIssues found and fixed:\r\n* `CNNNetwork` did not have dependency `tensorflow` isolated\r\n* some splitters needed default test params via `get_test_params`\r\n* performance metrics and their tags needed to be properly registered in the registry\r\n* `PinballLoss` constructor was not `sklearn` compatible, similar to the bug in #3119\r\n\r\nIncludes the fix for
