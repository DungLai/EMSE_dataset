you for raising this issue!  \r\n\r\nI think the original reason that we have  `X.iloc[test_plus_train].sort_index()` is due to certain transformers which effectively trim the input for example `Differencer`.

Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nFixes [#3830](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3830)\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nStatsmodels with exogenous features would raise an exception in `predict` if `X` contained more indices than the range of `fh`.\r\nThis was due to all indices being passed through to `statsmodels` `predict`.  The fix ensures that only the expected `X` indices from the test set are passed to `statsmodels` `predict`.\r\n\r\nFixes #3830 as this was also the root cause of the exception raised when using `evaluate` with `statsmodels` based estimators.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1361870864","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3830#issuecomment-1361870864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3830","id":1361870864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5RLIAQ","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-21T18:44:01Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T18:44:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@adoherty21,
