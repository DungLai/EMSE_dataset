promised I'll expand on my thoughts here ahead of your discussion later this week.\r\n\r\nComing at this from the non-expert user's perspective, I would imagine that the most common uses for forecasters would be:\r\n\r\n* Make future predictions up to a certain point that may be defined in a number of ways:\r\n  * A fixed number of points ahead\r\n  * Up to a certain timestamp\r\n  * Something more complex, like a certain number of seasonal periods ahead. The periods may be known _a priori_ or inferred through seasonal decomposition.\r\n* Making in-sample predictions as a way of estimating residuals.\r\n\r\nI think wanting to know a prediction at a single point in time would be more unusual (with the exception of point `T + 1`). This is because if I'm going to make a prediction, I probably want to see how we get there (i.e. what is the trend) as well as the absolute value.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, I'll stick by my original suggestion of making an integer `i` shorthand for building a forecast horizon of `i` points out from `T`. It will make the common tasks simple, while still allowing the rarer tasks to be possible. Perhaps you could even use negative numbers for nowcasting (e.g. `fh=-len(y)` to start at the beginning of the training data).\r\n\r\nWishing to calculate a specific point or points that are offset from the end of the training data are, in my mind, less common tasks (note that this is just intuition, I have nothing to base this on). In this case under my proposal you would need to build the horizon directly yourself, i.e. `fh=np.array([4,5,6])` or `np.array([20])`. So this task doesn't become any simpler, but the more common tasks do.\r\n\r\nWhen you start adding in support for datetime indices this might be slightly more complex, but not by much (I think). In this case, the integer shorthand may need an extra parameter alongside it, such as `freq` or `end` - so basically, the minimum arguments needed for a call to [`pandas.date_range()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.date_range.html). If the forecaster cached the frequency and final timestamp from the training data, then this information could be used to set defaults for these extra parameters, simplifying things further to the point where you're back to a single integer in most cases.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the integer shorthand could live in a different parameter; let's call it `horizon_periods` for consistency with `pandas.date_range`. `validate_fh` would then need to check both `fh` and `horizon_periods` to ensure there are no conflicting options. As full datetime indexing is introduced, you could extend these signatures to include `horizon_frequency`, `horizon_start` and `horizon_end`.\r\n\r\nI don't believe any of these suggestions would restrict the interface. You can still make multiple forecasts or single forecasts. The only difference is that you would have an extra way of specifying multiple forecasts available to you, alongside the existing approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/555765085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"big-o","id":1134151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o","html_url":"https://github.com/big-o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"big-o","id":1134151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o","html_url":"https://github.com/big-o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T23:35:47Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T23:35:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/200","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/200/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/200/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/200/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/200","id":523978180,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MjM5NzgxODA=","number":200,"title":"fit_predict

The only downside I can see is that it would require polluting your namespace with an extra import to use it. This is a pretty minor point though, and it could even be circumvented by allowing methods like `predict` to accept the arguments that can construct a `ForecastTask` inside the method, e.g. `m.predict(upto=2020)` or `m.predict(steps=5)`. Alternatively you could encapsulate these arguments: `m.predict(horizon=dict(periods=10, freq='D'))` but this could seem fiddly to some.\r\n\r\nIf I was being really picky, I would suggest naming it `ForecastHorizon` or even just `Forecast` though, as \"task\" is quite an abstract term that has more relevance to the architects of the project than the users.\r\n\r\nAs for the later point on ambiguity, your task solution would certainly be one very clear way of addressing this; probably the clearest of all the proposed ones. Perhaps another approach would be inferring it from the types (`int`/`datetime`), but I think I prefer the task-based approach, especially if it had the option of just specifying the parameters instead of constructing the object in the current namespace.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/556555651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"big-o","id":1134151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o","html_url":"https://github.com/big-o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/557274087","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/201#issuecomment-557274087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/201","id":557274087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzI3NDA4Nw==","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-21T21:12:32Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T21:12:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for your feedback.
