My solution would be to have an extra \"apply\" function - but here I am currently relying on the fact, that any additional functions would return \"self\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nThis is just a draft.

is a merge/review ready sketch for how multivariate `y` could be supported for multivariate forecasters, alongside the possibility to pass `np.array` and `pd.Series`. This is based on the design in [STEP no.5](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/tree/main/steps/05_scitype_based_IO_checks), adapted to the new forecasting base class.\r\n\r\nThe key ingredient are:\r\n\r\n* converters parameterized by from, to, and as - in the `convertIO`module. Besides the obvious conversion functionality, the converters can be given access to a dictionary via reference in the `store` argument, where information for inverting lossy conversions (like from `pd.DataFrame` to `np.array`) can be stored\r\n* a new tag `y_type` which encodes the type of `y` that the private `_fit`, `_predict`, and `_update` assume internally - for now, it's just one type and not a list of compatible types\r\n* some logic in the public \"plumbing\" area of `fit`, `predict`, `update`, which converts inputs to the public layer to the desired input of the logic layer and back\r\n\r\nThis is for discussion, and I expect major change before we merge.\r\n\r\nIt might be especially interesting to discuss the following interaction with typing:\r\nthe third argument of the converter, the \"as\" argument, is a scitype, and designed to have the same name as the respective `typing` composite type. Also see discussion in #965, #973 and #974.\r\n\r\nThinking of the logical continuation of this:\r\n\r\n* extend this to the other arguments, e.g., `X`\r\n* the individual argument checks like `check_X` etc should be replaced by checks of the kind `check(what, as : scitype)`, e.g., `check(y, \"Series\")` should replace the less generic `check_y`.\r\n* extend this to time series classification, to support 3D numpy arrays, awkward arrays, nested data frames\r\n\r\nA \"visionary\" pathway may see this working with type annotations that are scitypes, not `typing` machine types, e.g.,\r\n```python\r\nfit(X : Series, Y : Series)\r\netc\r\n_fit(X: Series, Y : UnivariateSeries)\r\n```\r\nand checks/conversions being done automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/869011954","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1038#issuecomment-869011954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1038","id":869011954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTAxMTk1NA==","user":{"login":"Lovkush-A","id":25344832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQ0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25344832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A","html_url":"https://github.com/Lovkush-A","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-26T14:35:05Z","updated_at":"2021-06-26T14:35:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'm happy to work on the second task.\r\n\r\n@fkiraly @mloning Are there any design discussion we need to have in advance? I anticipate something like this:\r\n\r\n* Have a function `make_multivariate_forecaster`, similar to `make_reduction`\r\n  * For now, there will only be one strategy, `by-column`, or similarly named\r\n  * I do not know if there are other reduction strategies, but maybe there are. Regardless, I think we should write it in a way that fits into a potential general reduction framework of 'input scitype, output scitype, strategy'\r\n* Have a new class like `ColumnByColumnForecaster`\r\n  * to initialise object, have something like new_forecaster = ColumnForecater(univariate_forecaster)\r\n  * while waiting for #980, this new class would over-write `fit` and `predict` to skip the checks (and prevent various tests from failing), and when that is sorted, method names changed to `_fit` and
