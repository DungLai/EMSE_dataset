my belief is that the stacking forecaster generalizes model ensembling to the case where you want to use a regression algorithm to do the forecasting combination (in this way it is like `sklearn's` stacking functionality). Typically this is the case when for each out of sample period you are interested in combining the forecasts from different models for just that period (and for just that univariate series if you are using multivariate or panel data). As a result, a cross-sectional (tabular) regression algorithm can be used to combine (stack) the predictions into a single \"final\" prediction. In this case the target is the actual values and the cross-sectional predictors are the different forecasts from the individual models. \r\n\r\nI think since the focus is typically only using information from the same period in the stacking there isn't a need for a forecaster (where the time dimension is used) to combine the predictions and just an ordinary regressor will do. \r\n\r\nOne specific use case is to combine forecasts using ordinary least squares (automatically determine weights assuming you want to minimize mean squared error). Of course, that can be generalized to include any regressor.\r\n\r\nSo I think this would be closely related to, but separate from hierarchical time series functionality, where you are looking to combine information across series. That can be implemented via regression too, but there your using a matrix that indicates how the series in the hierarchy are related to each other. \r\n\r\nA set of stacked (or otherwise ensembled/combined) forecasts (you'd have to do the stacking for each series in the hierarchy) could be an input to a hierarchical time series reconciliation.
