particular names (from `\"instances\"` and `\"timepoints\"`)\r\n\r\nA number of bugs were uncovered, these were fixed:\r\n* the `_nested_dataframe_has_nans` utility function did not work for nested data frames where index was not integer starting at zero - fixed replacing `loc` indexing by `iloc`. Relies on PR #2216 where this is separated out.\r\n* a number of bugs around vectorization in `BaseForecaster` - it did not actually work.\r\n\r\nFYI @TonyBagnall about the first bug - I think you have seen it before?\r\nFYI @danbartl about the second bug. Vectorization now works as intended, at least for `Panel` input.

The fix is to  add a new function that uses `pd.infer_freq` to update the frequency of each series in `VetorizedDF.__getitem__`.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
