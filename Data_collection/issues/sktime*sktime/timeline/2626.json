end.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1124406635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6594340630,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5JgEevzwAAAAGJDacW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6594340630","actor":{"login":"kejsitake","id":23707808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzA3ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23707808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake","html_url":"https://github.com/kejsitake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T00:28:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6594340632,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5JgEevzwAAAAGJDacY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6594340632","actor":{"login":"kejsitake","id":23707808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzA3ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23707808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake","html_url":"https://github.com/kejsitake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kejsitake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T00:28:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6594832738,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCVKAsc5JgEevzwAAAAGJFSli","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6594832738","actor":{"login":"phershbe","id":25594870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTk0ODcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25594870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe","html_url":"https://github.com/phershbe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phershbe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c1971e55151b288e7428b1cf7dd044938f95a694","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phershbe/sktime/commits/c1971e55151b288e7428b1cf7dd044938f95a694","created_at":"2022-05-12T03:16:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"phershbe","id":25594870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTk0ODcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25594870?v=4","gravatar_
