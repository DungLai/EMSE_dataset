yes, I'm able to reproduce this on my local system (3.8, win, main).\r\nAny comments that help tracking down the issue are appreciated.\r\n\r\nMy first suspicion was that the model's `cutoff` is not updated correctly, hence the `fh` will be relative to the wrong `cutoff`, from `fit` rather than `update`. But that's not true, the `cutoff` seems to be updated correctly (by the base class).\r\nSo it does not seem to be a framework issue.\r\n\r\nHence, I now suspect that there is some systematic issue in how the `fh` is passed to the models, in the concrete classes.\r\nIf correct, the wrapped models should be asked to forecast at [number of time points seen in update] plus [relative fh], but probably they are just asked to forecast at [relative fh], since the implementer did not anticipate a situation in which the time point last seen is *not* the same as the time point last fitted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1004089148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5835274727,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc5AvW6azwAAAAFbzznn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5835274727","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T13:24:16Z","label":{"name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1004090989","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1788#issuecomment-1004090989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1788","id":1004090989,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc472TZt","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-03T13:26:08Z","updated_at":"2022-01-03T13:26:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@raphaccf,

It seems there are two things happening:\r\n\r\n* cutoff handling in `sktime`'s interface to `pmdarima` - due to that, the `pmdarima` is asked to predict with a cutoff, as if `update(update_params=False)` never happened. This can be changed.\r\n* `pmdarima`, and `statsmodels` on which it is based, does not seem to be able to make forecasts with fixed model parameters on data different from which it was fitted on. I may just be missing how to call it, but neither `pmdarima` nor `statsmodels` `fit` and `predict` seem to offer this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf the second is correct, the best we could do at `sktime` is to return the forecasts that the model would have produced for the same time stamps *before* `update` was called.\r\n\r\nMay be worth asking a question on `statsmodels` or `pmdarima`, and if the lack of this feature is confirmed, then raising an
