The reason they are different is that the book is based on the `forecast` library in R, our class is based on `statsmodels` exponential smoothing class. \r\n\r\nOne way to get the fitted parameters is to use `get_fitted_params()` (the interface is still experimental): \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.all import *\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nforecaster = ExponentialSmoothing(trend=None, seasonal=None, optimized=True)\r\nforecaster.fit(y)\r\nforecaster.get_fitted_params()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also the `AutoETS` class from `from sktime.forecasting.ets import AutoETS`, but again based on statsmodels. \r\n\r\nA PR would be appreciated if you want to write the examples you suggest! \r\n\r\nI also ping @HYang1996 who wrote `AutoETS`.

graphs.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/731524546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"robomotic","id":315964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTk2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic","html_url":"https://github.com/robomotic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4023580489,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDAyMzU4MDQ4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4023580489","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-21T07:48:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4023580492,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwMjM1ODA0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4023580492","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-21T07:48:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/731730410","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/476#issuecomment-731730410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/476","id":731730410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTczMDQxMA==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-22T11:03:03Z","updated_at":"2020-11-22T11:03:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi @robomotic, \r\n\r\nI had a look at the notebook and added two options to get the parameters: \r\n\r\n* you can use `forecaster._fitted_forecaster._results.params[\"smoothing_level\"]` where the `_fitted_forecaster` is the results wrapper from statsmodels\r\n* `forecaster.get_fitted_params()[\"smoothing_level\"]` which is sktime's unified interface to inspect fitted parameters (still experimental) and returns a dictionary with the fitted parameters, internally it just looks them up in the `_fitted_forecaster` object\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/731730410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4024676207,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDAyNDY3NjIwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4024676207","actor":{"login":"robomotic","id":315964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTk2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic","html_url":"https://github.com/robomotic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-22T11:03:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4024676209,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwMjQ2NzYyMDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4024676209","actor":{"login":"robomotic","id":315964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTk2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic","html_url":"https://github.com/robomotic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-22T11:03:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/731777696","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/476#issuecomment-731777696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/476","id":731777696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTc3NzY5Ng==","user":{"login":"robomotic","id":315964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTk2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic","html_url":"https://github.com/robomotic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robomotic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-22T17:03:15Z","updated_at":"2020-11-22T17:03:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Brilliant
