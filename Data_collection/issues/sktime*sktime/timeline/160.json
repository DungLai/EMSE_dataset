I guess I should have opened a separate issue, since I don't think this fixes @i3evelyn 's original error.\r\nBTW I realized that the problem was the version of scikit-learn. Downgrading it from 0.22.0 to 0.21.3, I was able to get the current release working. On the other end, the pull request needs `scikit-learn>=0.22`, which is why CI currently fails. I hope it's still useful for some future release, while maybe it would be a good idea to change the requirements for the current release to `scikit-learn<0.22`.\r\nI take the chance to raise another requirements-related issue: after creating a conda environment, `pip install sktime` will fail on macOS because `numpy` and `Cython` are not available and pip won't install them automatically. This doesn't happen on linux.\r\nThank you again, let me know if you prefer that I open a separate issue for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/562570804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"simone-pignotti","id":44410066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDEwMDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44410066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti","html_url":"https://github.com/simone-pignotti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simone-pignotti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2861364539,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg2MTM2NDUzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2861364539","actor":{"login":"i3evelyn","id":16744577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ0NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16744577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn","html_url":"https://github.com/i3evelyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-06T13:27:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2861364544,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NjEzNjQ1NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/2861364544","actor":{"login":"i3evelyn","id":16744577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ0NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16744577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn","html_url":"https://github.com/i3evelyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i3evelyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-06T13:27:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/562686985","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/160#issuecomment-562686985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/160","id":562686985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjY4Njk4NQ==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T18:31:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T18:31:45Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Strange,
