Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nCloses #1750\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nProhibit the use of `pd.Timestamp` type for `cutoff` in `ForecastingHorizon`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis solves the problem of extracting frequency from an object that will not have this property in some future (see this comment https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15146#issuecomment-273266806 and the whole deprecation PR for details). Although the problem is solved, the solution itself is far from being ideal. The major negative consequence is the mismatch in types between a time series index, which is normally `pd.DatetimeIndex`, and the absolute forecasting horizon of `pd.PeriodIndex` obtained given `pd.Period` cutoff. This happens when the cutoff is taken to be one of the `y.index` (`pd.DatetimeIndex`) elements, which is `pd.Timestamp`. This is not allowed, so we have to convert the cutoff to `pd.Period`. The result of `fh.to_absolute(cutoff).to_pandas()` is then a `pd.PeriodIndex`.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this conversion should happen under the hood, without a user noticing it. But it seems impossible without major refactoring. In particular, `ForecastingHorizon` is not aware of the time series itself and its frequency. So it has to obtain the frequency somehow. In the current implementation it is only `cutoff`. An alternative to consider would be to pass frequency explicitly as an argument to `ForecastingHorizon`.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nThis is very controversial and touches the very core of the library, so I hope for a very careful consideration of this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nPartially addresses #1750. More changes are necessary, but I would prefer to break the change into smaller logically complete PRs.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nFollowing this conversation: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2694#issuecomment-1146769665, and [this enhancement proposal](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/17_forecasting_horizon_freq/step.md#2a-earlies-possible-pass-in-constructor), I added a new optional argument `freq` to the constructor of `ForecastingHorizon`.\r\n\r\nFrequency is inferred in `ForecastingHorizon` methods indirectly, via the forecaster's `cutoff` passed to methods. In all uses, this is equal to the `cutoff` of the forecaster, which is the last time index of `y` seen in `fit`. This currently carries the `freq` for all cases of time-like indexing, but will lose it after deprecation, since single time indices will no longer carry `freq`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR frequency is passed directly upon construction or via the setter method. Cutoff is no longer used as a source of frequency information.\r\n\r\nThe biggest consequence of this design update is necessity to pass frequency to the `ForecastingHorizon` at some point for the forecasters to preserve their behavior. The minimal code change is to assign frequency via setter method to already existing `fh` in a few of `sktime.forecasting.base._base.BaseForecaster` methods. Frequency is obtained from `y` passed to `fit`, `predict`, and other public methods of this base class.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?

This is truly a very fiddly and unpleasant problem.\r\n\r\nI have been somewhat confused, I have to admit, as you may see from some replies, and have now tried to make an effort to understand things better.\r\n\r\nLet me first try to summarize what I've understood is at the root of the problem, so you can check my understanding:\r\n\r\n* `pandas` is going to deprecate `Timestamp.freq`. No such deprecation will happen in `Period` or `pd.Index` children that have a `freq` attribute.\r\n* `BaseForecaster.cutoff` and `ForecastingHorizon` rely on `Timestamp.freq`. A key location is when `cutoff` is being passed, especially in `to_absolute`, to infer the shifts.\r\n\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, I might have a solution: changing the `cutoff` to `Index`, which still carries `freq`.\r\nIn a first step, we can change the private `_cutoff`, in a second step, we can deprecate `cutoff` being an index element and change it to a length-1 index as well.\r\n\r\nThe idea is, `pd.Index` descendants will still carry `freq`, even if elements are `Timestamp`. The rest should hence still work, right?\r\nWe may like to be careful with sub-setting though, since `pd.index` loses `freq` if subsetting to something that is too short, i.e., length 1 or 2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1172942142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6922440117,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCVKAsc5AQAUxzwAAAAGcnA21","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6922440117","actor":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-02T18:34:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6922440119,"node_id":"SE_lADOCVKAsc5AQAUxzwAAAAGcnA23","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6922440119","actor":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-02T18:34:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1172946388","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1750#issuecomment-1172946388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1750","id":1172946388,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5F6b3U","user":{"login":"khrapovs","id":3774663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3774663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs","html_url":"https://github.com/khrapovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khrapovs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-02T19:05:44Z","updated_at":"2022-07-02T19:05:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">
