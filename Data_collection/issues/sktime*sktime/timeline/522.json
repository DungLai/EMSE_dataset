The issue is that the AutoARIMA module is not honoring the set_params internally. It is getting updated in the `AutoARIMA` class itself since it is inheriting from the base sklearn class, but the updated parameters are not getting passed to the internal `_forecaster`.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n```python\r\nregressor = KNeighborsRegressor()\r\nprint(f\"Original n_neighbors: {regressor.get_params()['n_neighbors']}\")\r\n\r\nregressor.set_params(n_neighbors=1)\r\nprint(f\"\\nAfter manually setting n_neighbors: {regressor.get_params()['n_neighbors']}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOriginal n_neighbors: 5\r\n\r\nAfter manually setting n_neighbors: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see the parameters get updated\r\n\r\n### Unexpected Behavior\r\n```python\r\nforecaster = AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True)\r\nprint(f\"Original sp: {forecaster.get_params()['sp']}\")\r\nprint(f\"Original _Forecaster: {forecaster._forecaster}\")\r\nprint(f\"Original _Forecaster sp: {forecaster._forecaster.m}\")\r\n\r\nforecaster.set_params(sp=3)\r\nprint(f\"\\nAfter manually setting sp: {forecaster.get_params()['sp']}\")\r\nprint(f\"After manually setting sp _Forecaster: {forecaster._forecaster}\")\r\nprint(f\"After manually setting sp _Forecaster sp: {forecaster._forecaster.m}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOriginal sp: 1\r\nOriginal _Forecaster: AutoARIMA(error_action='warn', suppress_warnings=True, with_intercept=True)\r\nOriginal _Forecaster sp: 1\r\n\r\nAfter manually setting sp: 3\r\nAfter manually setting sp _Forecaster: AutoARIMA(error_action='warn', suppress_warnings=True, with_intercept=True)\r\nAfter manually setting sp _Forecaster sp: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In this case, the parameters get adjusted in the AutoARIMA class, but are not passed to the underlying _AutoARIMA object (remains set to the default value of 1).**\r\n\r\n### Issue that it causes\r\n\r\nSo when we use the ForecastingGridSearchCV with AutoARIMA, the parameter `sp` does not get updated at all during the `set_param` step outlined below and remains set to the default value of 1. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/d3ac2b45d89946363899370c3b43cf52a103e501/sktime/forecasting/model_selection/_tune.py#L119\r\n\r\nThis why all the results come out identical from the hyperparameters search as can be seen from the metrics below (mean sMAPE = 0.40163609 for both sp=3 and sp=12.\r\n\r\n```\r\nforecaster_param_grid = {'sp': [3, 12]}\r\nforecaster = AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True)\r\n\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    initial_window=int(len(y_train) * 0.5),\r\n    start_with_window=True,\r\n    window_length=36,\r\n    # fh=np.arange(12) + 1  # Not Supported Yet (Prediction can only be the next time point for now)\r\n)\r\n\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(forecaster, cv=cv, param_grid=forecaster_param_grid, verbose=True)\r\ngscv.fit(y_train)\r\ngscv.cv_results_\r\n```\r\n```\r\n{'mean_fit_time': array([1.60882616, 1.63023949]),\r\n 'mean_score_time': array([0.18559933, 0.14276004]),\r\n 'param_sp': masked_array(data=[3, 12],\r\n              mask=[False, False],\r\n        fill_value='?',\r\n             dtype=object),\r\n 'params': [{'sp': 3}, {'sp': 12}],\r\n 'mean_test_sMAPE': array([0.40163609, 0.40163609]),\r\n 'rank_test_sMAPE': array([1, 1])}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Potential Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution has been derived using the recommendations found on [this page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html). In particular, a custom set_param() method could be written in the AutoARIMA class to also override the _Forecaster param values\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef set_params(self, **parameters):\r\n    for parameter, value in parameters.items():\r\n        setattr(self, parameter, value)\r\n        if parameter == 'sp':\r\n            parameter='m'\r\n        setattr(self._forecaster, parameter, value)  ## Added to propagate the parameter to the underlying _Forecaster\r\n    return self\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have verified this locally and it works. If you are ok with it, I can submit a PR.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nforecaster_param_grid = {'sp': [3, 6, 12, 24]}\r\nforecaster = AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True)\r\n\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(\r\n    initial_window=int(len(y_train) * 0.5),\r\n    start_with_window=True,\r\n    window_length=36,\r\n    # fh=np.arange(12) + 1  # Not Supported Yet (Prediction can only be the next time point for now)\r\n)\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(forecaster, cv=cv, param_grid=forecaster_param_grid, verbose=True)\r\ngscv.fit(y_train)\r\ngscv.cv_results_\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n{'mean_fit_time': array([0.67233038, 0.76242065, 4.10686517, 0.00775552]),\r\n 'mean_score_time': array([0.11560488, 0.15221286, 0.1613667 , 0.        ]),\r\n 'param_sp': masked_array(data=[3, 6, 12, 24],\r\n              mask=[False, False, False, False],\r\n        fill_value='?',\r\n             dtype=object),\r\n 'params': [{'sp': 3}, {'sp': 6}, {'sp': 12}, {'sp': 24}],\r\n 'mean_test_sMAPE': array([0.37408572, 0.37408572, 0.29277678,        nan]),\r\n 'rank_test_sMAPE': array([2, 2, 1, 4])}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Now the results vary for each value of the hyperparameter as expected.**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/743829088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ngupta23","id":33585645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTg1NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33585645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23","html_url":"https://github.com/ngupta23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngupta23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4104901072,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ0MTA0OTAxMDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4104901072","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-12T21:25:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/743895560","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/522#issuecomment-743895560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/522","id":743895560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Mzg5NTU2MA==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-12T21:28:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T21:28:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I see - thanks @ngupta23 for investigating this! \r\n\r\nI think there's a simpler solution. The problem is that we instantiate `self._forecaster` in `__init__`, instead we should instantiate it in `fit`. That way, updated params would be propagated properly.

I am only familiar with `unittest` and had some issues setting up `pytest` on my end so I could not add a unit test specifically for this. If you could add it for me, I would appreciate it.
