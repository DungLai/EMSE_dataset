@artdgn, thanks for raising the issue! \r\n\r\nLooks like our TSFreshTransformer doesn't support unequal-length data yet, mainly because we rely on our `tabularize` function internally when going from the nested input format to the long format expected by tsfresh, even though we could represent unequal length data in the long format. \r\n\r\nI also noted that the index name is hard coded in the data conversion. \r\n\r\nThis code works for me, but it's probably not what you need:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nfrom

Thanks, I didn't consider the possibility it expects equal lengths. I've now tried my dummy example with equal length vectors and it works (even without the need to set the index name).\r\n\r\nThis is helpful, because knowing this limitation it is still possible to use this transformer with various truncating / padding strategies (depends on what makes sense for the time series domain), so it's not too bad.\r\n\r\nMaybe worth to consider these options as short time fixes:\r\n1. Might be worth to mention that fact in both the docs, and more importantly in the classification tutorial (where it is the first example).\r\n2. Until you have time to refactor and fix this, I think a simple detection and warning / ValueError about trying to pass unequal length data to `tabularize` might prevent this kind of confusion. A somewhat more complex version of this \"safer\" behaviour might be together with the waning to just truncate the the vectors to same length (and warn about this behaviour).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/695205751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"artdgn","id":29574203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc0MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29574203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn","html_url":"https://github.com/artdgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artdgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3785086222,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc4NTA4NjIyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3785086222","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-19T12:11:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3785086223,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3ODUwODYyMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3785086223","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-19T12:11:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/695304710","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/397#issuecomment-695304710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/397","id":695304710,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTMwNDcxMA==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-19T16:01:05Z","updated_at":"2020-09-19T16:01:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks

discussed with @TonyBagnall, this PR upgrades the base classifier class refactor #1594 to use the existing checks and coercions in `datatypes` instead of the new, custom functions written by @TonyBagnall.\r\n\r\nIt is based on #1745 (merged) and #1748 (not yet merged), which in turn have some routines by @TonyBagnall from #1594 moved into the `datatypes` module (e.g., inferring the data characteristics for certain mtypes).\r\n\r\nNote: this is a PR into the other PR, not into `main`.\r\n\r\nA lot of files appear changed, that's because #1745 (merged in `main`) and #1748 (not merged in main) are not yet part of #1594. To see the \"real\" diffs (localized to `BaseClassifier` and small of size), #1748 needs to be merged with `main`, and #1594 needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nReviewers of this PR can hence focus exclusively on changes in `BaseClassifier` and the `base` module it is
