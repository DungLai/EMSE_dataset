PR addresses #1027 and part of #1032.\r\nThe post-PR state allows testing of concrete objects, not just classes, using the current test suite.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by modifying the `estimator_checks._construct_instance` utility:\r\n\r\n* pre-PR, this always assumes the argument `Estimator` is a class, and creates an object after lookup of default parameters from the default parameter registry, using those parameters. This object is then returned.\r\n* post-PR, it first checks whether the argument is a class or an object. If an object, it just returns the argument; if a class, it proceeds as pre-PR.\r\n\r\nSince `_construct_instance` is called at the start of every estimator related test, this change enables all those tests to take objects as well as classes.\r\n\r\nFor the user, this allows convenient command line testing of newly written estimators without first having to deposit default parameters in the default parameter registry, or changing the registry file to test with different parameter settings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1072/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/945016430","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1027#issuecomment-945016430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1027","id":945016430,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc44U85u","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-16T22:37:49Z","updated_at":"2021-10-16T22:37:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"This is addressed by the merged PR #1361 and #1407.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/945016430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5473557694,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc43U8rwzwAAAAFGP9y-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/5473557694","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-16T22:37:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
