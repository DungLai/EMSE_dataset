I've opened an issue here #1451.\r\n\r\nRegarding tags:\r\nFor forecasters, we have `\"X-y-must-have-same-index\"` which covers the case where `X` indices need to contain those in `y` (being forecast or observed).\r\nThis does not cover the above case, as you state. So I wonder how we should indicate this as a tag, or whether we should change the meaning of the existing tag. Or, otherwise, how we tell the user.\r\n\r\nAny good ideas, @IlyasMoutawwakil
