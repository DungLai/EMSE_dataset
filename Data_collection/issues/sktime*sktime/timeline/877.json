for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n#877\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nCreates Sktime BaseObject class that inherits from scikit-learn's BaseEstimator and only adds the method for returning estimator tags.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nChanges in _base.py. The changes in _meta.py are just to comply with pydocstyle checks (so all of base is compliant).\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nStill need to set up the unit testing (want to apply applicable the unit tests that are currently applied to BaseEstimator except those dealing with fit functionality). \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4882296410,"node_id":"MDE0OkNvbm5lY3RlZEV2ZW50NDg4MjI5NjQxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/4882296410","actor":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-13T13:41:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-17T20:25:15Z","updated_at":"2021-06-17T20:25:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/971","id":924306869,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MjQzMDY4Njk=","number":971,"title":"[ENH]

is a feature suggestion arising from discussion in #877, #931, #942.\r\n\r\nI suggest two new/refactored interface points:\r\n* `summary` which is attached to `BaseObject` (as in post-merge #877)\r\n* `get_fitted_params` which is attached to `sktime`'s (not `scikit-learn`'s) `BaseEstimator`\r\n\r\nUpdate: it is probably better than the more convoluted suggestion below if the returns of both are `dict` and behave just like `get_params`. Any logic for retrieval should be provided in there, or a private version `_get_fitted_params`, rather than in \"populate\" functions.\r\n \r\n---\r\nOld API suggestion\r\n\r\nBoth should behave precisely like `scikit-learn`'s `get_params`, except that parameters are looked up in dedicated dictionaries `reports` and `fitted_params` rather than in self-attributes that correspond to `__init__` named arguments.\r\n\r\n`fit` or `__init__` could populate these dictionaries, this could happen by `_populate_fitted_params` and `_populate_summary` private interfaces called at the end of `fit` (the non-private with the \"plumbing\" logic), which is specific to individual estimators/objects, or directly in `_fit` (not sure which is the better convention?).\r\n\r\nFor functionality, I think we can copy-paste `scikit-learn`'s `get_params` code here, and adapt it by making the change in where parameters are being retrieved. This would ensure nested access, which for example `get_fitted_params` doesn't have at current.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n@mloning, @aiwalter, @RNKuhns,

If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments.

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
