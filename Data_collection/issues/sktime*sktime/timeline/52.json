Tell me more about it\r\n(continuing from #388 here since there it's off-topic)\r\n\r\n@moradisten, many time series (classification) methods rely on a distance or kernel, in the way that it's a composite of the choice of kernel/distance and the method that computes distance/kernel matrices.\r\n\r\nTherefore kernels and distances are natural encapsulation and abstraction points in the sense of a template pattern.\r\n\r\nA concrete distance method would be a composite, following the sklearn estimator composition formalism.\r\n\r\nHaving a way to construct a method in the way `Knn(MyFavouriteDistance(param1 = 2), k=4)` with components all estimators would be
