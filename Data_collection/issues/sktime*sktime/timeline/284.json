@Multivin12 and thanks for contributing to sktime!\r\n\r\nA few tips for contributing:\r\n* [general contributing guideline/workflow](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\r\n* you should probably inherit from [`BaseSeriesAsFeaturesTransformer`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/sktime/transformers/series_as_features/base.py#L9), the [`RandomIntervalSegmenter`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/57944d5b03b31c7f0d5b8746b1df6642bbe42b6d/sktime/transformers/series_as_features/segment.py#L124) may serve you as a template/starting point\r\n* input and output data type should be a nested pandas data frame, for a quick intro check out our [classification tutorial notebook](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/examples/02_classification_univariate.ipynb)\r\n* the advanced [installation instructions](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/installation.html) will also be useful for running tests, we use pytest, you can simply run `pytest` or `make tests` in the root dir, please also add some unit tests that check the methods\r\n* please make sure you comply with a PEP8 style, you can `pip install flake8` and run `flake8 sktime/` in the root dir to see if everything works\r\n* opening a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) early is probably a good idea, I'm happy to review the

Sorry I haven't had a chance to dig into this too much as I'm snowed under with marking at the minute. If it doesn't create a lot of repeated work then perhaps ShapeDTW as a metric would be a good idea (i.e. if it doesn't have to transform anything multiple times, each time a series is used in a NN classification). If you do have to repeat some kind of transformation each time you use a series though then I expect it would make things very slow (for example, if you had to transform each training case every time you compare to a test series then this would be a lot of work!) \r\n\r\nAlternatively, are you sure that the kNN in sktime doesn't support multivariate data? It's been a while since I implemented/tested any of that and my head is a bit fuzzy about what was actually implemented or not (I'm getting old!) but the comments suggest that it does support multivariate TSC. Eg in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/sktime/classification/distance_based/_time_series_neighbors.py line 237 lists the paramaters where it says:\r\n\r\n`X : sktime-format pandas dataframe with shape([n_cases,n_dimensions])`\r\n\r\nGiven this explicitly states n_dimensions then it suggests that this is an option - it is very possible that this was included as a future feature however, and classification was restricted to univariate for now (I remember the data checks were a pain for even 1d series so I may have only got that far in the first push) but it might be worth double-checking if you can already use multivariate data for distance measures. After all, it would be a bit confusing why the measures can handle multivariate data if the classifier can't! (but again, I might just have a bad memory and may not have gotten that far). I'll be able to dig into the code more over the next week or two if need be though, but hopefully that's enough to go on for now

@jasonlines and thanks for your response! I did try and put multivariate data into k-NN (once I updated my fork because it was out of date) but I did get this error message - \r\n\r\nValueError: X must be univariate with X.shape[1] == 1, but found: X.shape[1] == 2. For multivariate problems please consider compositor classes. Estimator-specific multivariate approaches are not implemented yet.\r\n\r\nSo I think what i'm going to do is implement ShapeDTW as a new metric for kNN as that will support univariate data (classifying multivariate TS is out the scope of my MSc project). And yes I wouldn't have to repeat transformations only issue is that ShapeDTW has a lot of parameters but I can probably pass them through like 'mpdist' does.

I was thinking that if I wrote shape_dtw as a metric then it would be doing the transform inside the distance function (or doing something hacky inside KNeighboursTimeSeriesClassifier but I want to avoid that). Not only that ShapeDTW has a lot of parameters so I was thinking it might be more logical to put it into a class. I guess the idea I had was that the class would transform the data then this transformed data will be fed into kNeighboursTimeSeriesClassifier (so the transformations would only ever be done once).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/642565327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vincent-nich12","id":36476633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDc2NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36476633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12","html_url":"https://github.com/vincent-nich12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3433577295,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQzMzU3NzI5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3433577295","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-11T10:45:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3433577298,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MzM1NzcyOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3433577298","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-11T10:45:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"vincent-nich12","id":36476633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDc2NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36476633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12","html_url":"https://github.com/vincent-nich12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-nich12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T11:35:00Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T11:35:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/287","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/287/labels{/name}","comments_url

Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nPR fixes issue number #284.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe algorithm that I have implemented here is ShapeDTW which is similar to ordinary DTW except that instead of performing DTW on the original time series, you transform it into a list of arrays or shapelets. DTW is then performed on these list of arrays. This algorithm involved implementing several new transformers - SlidingWindowSegmenter, DerivativeTransformer, DWTTransformer and more. This algorithm did require writing a helper function in TimeSeriesNeighbours so that this module is compatible with multivariate classification (the distance metrics are compatable but the original TimeSeriesNeighbours is not). \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n\r\nNot anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\n\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n \r\n- [ ] I have updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my algorithm works.\r\n   \r\n- [x] I have updated sktime's \r\n[estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm\r\n committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/287/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3448639539,"node_id":"MDE0OkNvbm5lY3RlZEV2ZW50MzQ0ODYzOTUzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/3448639539","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-16T12:02:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/667209218","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/284#issuecomment-667209218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/284","id":667209218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzIwOTIxOA==","user":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T16:19:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T16:19:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closed by #287 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/667209218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
