to follow up - you can try out the same method but with a different set of initiation parameters.  For example if you try out a different minimizer (for example `bh` or `ls` - check out the [method section](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/api_reference/auto_generated/sktime.forecasting.exp_smoothing.ExponentialSmoothing.html) in the docs) then you should no longer have the issues with convergence.   You may of course still need to play around with the parameters or try out a different forecaster in order to get a forecast that you are happy with - but trying out a different set of initiation parameters will help you with no longer getting convergence errors.  eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.exp_smoothing import ExponentialSmoothing\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n_, y = load_longley()\r\ny.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(zip(y.columns, y.columns), names=[\"l1\", \"l2\"])\r\n\r\nforecaster = ExponentialSmoothing(method=\"ls\")\r\nforecaster.fit(y)\r\ny_pred = forecaster.predict(fh=[1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet us know - does this solution work for you and should we now close the issue? Also let us know if you have additional questions.
