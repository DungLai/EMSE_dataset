It is much better to build each component and post process the final classifier. I'm just debugging components to make sure the output is not significantly different to the java version, tsml. Working document is here, which I will update this week.    \r\n\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05738\r\n\r\nthe easiest way to progress is to build each component with the train file. Code to do this is in contrib/experiments.py in the dev branch. We have a Hive-Cote wrapper, that can either load from file or build from scratch, we will push it soon, probably next week.

a bit more complex than putting them in a pipeline, since you need a weight estimate of the accuracy from the training data, and there are bespoke ways of doing that, and a voting scheme. However, this is very simple and we have it in place, just need to test and push it.
