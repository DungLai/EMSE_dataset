the bug**\r\nCombining forecasters in an `AutoEnsembleForecaster` which makes good predictions. I'd like to get conformal predictions for the same ensembled model. It's returning an error related to `_split()`, and I'm treating the Ensemble as a regular forecaster and following the example in the [CI Docs](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/api_reference/auto_generated/sktime.forecasting.conformal.ConformalIntervals.html).\r\n\r\nLooks like there is some parallelism when trying to `_compute_sliding_residuals`, which overly divides the training series. I wonder if there's a straightforward way to avoid this in Ensemble models which may have an arbitrary number of child models, but I haven't dove into the deep logic. I could imagine there are issues with aggregating in sample forecasts for ensemble models but this would be a great feature to have if possible.\r\n\r\nOn further digging, it seems to work if `len(ytrain)` > `10*len(fh)`. I suppose there might be 10x parallelism. Perhaps we could check the `len`s and reduce `n_jobs` or similar, or provide an explicit warning if there are unavoidable length requirements.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.conformal import ConformalIntervals\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import AutoEnsembleForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.exp_smoothing import ExponentialSmoothing\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import ARIMA\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nytrain, ytest = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=24)\r\nprint(len(ytrain), len(ytest))\r\n\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(ytest.index, is_relative=False)\r\n\r\nes = ExponentialSmoothing(sp=12)\r\nar = ARIMA()\r\n\r\nforecasters = [\r\n    (\"AR\", ar),\r\n    (\"ES\", es)\r\n]\r\n\r\nae = AutoEnsembleForecaster(forecasters=forecasters, test_size=24, method='inverse-variance')\r\n\r\nconformal_forecaster = ConformalIntervals(ae)\r\nconformal_forecaster.fit(ytrain, fh=fh)\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n120 24\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nInput In [1], in <cell line: 26>()\r\n     23 ae = AutoEnsembleForecaster(forecasters=forecasters, test_size=24, method='inverse-variance')\r\n     25 conformal_forecaster = ConformalIntervals(ae)\r\n---> 26 conformal_forecaster.fit(ytrain, fh=fh)\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/forecasting/base/_base.py:303, in BaseForecaster.fit(self, y, X, fh)\r\n    301 # we call the ordinary _fit if no looping/vectorization needed\r\n    302 if not vectorization_needed:\r\n--> 303     self._fit(y=y_inner, X=X_inner, fh=fh)\r\n    304 else:\r\n    305     # otherwise we call the vectorized version of fit\r\n    306     self._vectorize(\"fit\", y=y_inner, X=X_inner, fh=fh)\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/forecasting/conformal.py:150, in ConformalIntervals._fit(self, y, X, fh)\r\n    147 self.forecaster_.fit(y=y, X=X, fh=fh)\r\n    149 if self.fh_early_:\r\n--> 150     self.residuals_matrix_ = self._compute_sliding_residuals(\r\n    151         y=y,\r\n    152         X=X,\r\n    153         forecaster=self.forecaster,\r\n    154         initial_window=self.initial_window,\r\n    155         sample_frac=self.sample_frac,\r\n    156     )\r\n    158 return self\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/forecasting/conformal.py:411, in ConformalIntervals._compute_sliding_residuals(self, y, X, forecaster, initial_window, sample_frac, update)\r\n    405         warn(\r\n    406             f\"Couldn't predict after fitting on time series of length \\\r\n    407                          {len(y_train)}.\\n\"\r\n    408         )\r\n    409     return residuals\r\n--> 411 all_residuals = Parallel(n_jobs=self.n_jobs)(\r\n    412     delayed(_get_residuals_matrix_row)(forecaster.clone(), y, X, id)\r\n    413     for id in y_index\r\n    414 )\r\n    415 for idx, id in enumerate(y_index):\r\n    416     residuals_matrix.loc[id] = all_residuals[idx]\r\n\r\nFile ~/Code/ts/notebooks/tsdl/lib/python3.9/site-packages/joblib/parallel.py:1043, in Parallel.__call__(self, iterable)\r\n   1034 try:\r\n   1035     # Only set self._iterating to True if at least a batch\r\n   1036     # was dispatched.
