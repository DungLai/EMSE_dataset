Thus `type(self).__dict__.keys()` does **not** have `\"_predict_quantiles\"`, and returns _undesired_ `False`.\r\n\r\nSuggested implementation:\r\n```python\r\ndef _has_predict_quantiles_been_refactored(self):\r\n    \"\"\"Check if specific forecaster implements _predict_quantiles().\"\"\"\r\n    base_pq = BaseForecaster._predict_quantiles\r\n    this_pq = self.__class__._predict_quantiles\r\n    # true if self's _predict_quantiles is new implementation\r\n    return base_pq != this_pq\r\n\r\n```\r\nRelies on following expectations: `BaseForecaster._predict_quantiles` [is defined ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/bce815d11fff62b52882f13cd650c88972b08ab6/sktime/forecasting/base/_base.py#L1164)(which it is), `self.__class__._predict_quantiles` or equivalently `type(self)._predict_quantiles` always exist (since `BaseForecaster` is expected to be in the inheritance chain). If any class in the inheritance chain from `BaseForecaster` to `type(self)`/(`self.__class__`) has re-implemented `_predict_quantiles` then `base_pq != this_pq` would be _desired_ `True`.\r\n\r\n##### Small changes to  `predict()`.\r\n\r\n[In previous implementation of `predict()`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/bce815d11fff62b52882f13cd650c88972b08ab6/sktime/forecasting/base/_base.py#L239).
