I still agree with this (for my usage at least, maybe there is a better general format).\r\n\r\nCurrently, when I try to use the SummaryTransformer as the transformer in a pipeline (part of #1063), the multivariate panel data with 40 rows and 6 dimensions is transformed into 240 rows.

Are we are talking about the output type here?\r\n\r\nWell, format primarily - but yes, the output (of `transform`). The output probably has to be `pd.DataFrame`, which is fundamentally a 2D container.\r\n\r\n>I'm assuming the process is a bit like this\r\n\r\nYes - each univariate series produces a 1D array/container of length 9. This is stored in a one-row `pd.DataFrame` by convention.\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple series, you have as many of these as there were series. So, in the example, when you have 40 instances of univariate series, you (should) get a 2D arrays of shape (40, 9).\r\n\r\nThe question is what should happen if you have multiple variables (in the example 6). Then you can compute the summaries per variable and per instance.\r\n\r\nI can think of two natural ways:\r\n* multi-index over columns, this gives a (40, 54) in the example, with a column multi-index of two levels (feature and variable)\r\n* multi-index over rows, this gives a (240, 9) in the example, with a row multi-index of two levels (instance and variable)\r\n\r\nNote that since (or as long as) the output container is `pd.DataFrame`, the resulting structure must be 2D - but we can have multi-indices.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/989321129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/989333747","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1719#issuecomment-989333747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1719","id":989333747,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc46-Ajz","user":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-09T00:19:00Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T00:19:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If the output type is primitives, I think it is more natural for it to multi-index over columns.\r\n\r\nWhen the output from the transformer is a series, however, neither are great really.

the bug**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n-->\r\nI tried to use Catch22 to extract features of multivariate time series.\r\nI followed the example from main/examples/catch22.ipynb\r\nUsing the multivariate data from this example I have an input of 40 instannces each with 6 series of 100 data points. (40x6x100)\r\nI would expect 22 features per univariate series so an output of 40 instances each with 6 sets of 22 features (40x6x22), but I have an output of size 40x22.\r\nIt's writed: \"The default procedure will concatenate each column prior to transformation\" in the notebook, does that mean that for each instances, the algorithm take the 6 series (for 6 dimensions/columns) and flatten them in a single 600 data point time series ?\r\nDoes the features extracted means something then ? From what I uderstand from catch22 paper, they test their feature extraction method on univariate time series, so I would expect the multivariate version of the implementation of catch22 to apply the feature extractions mehod to each of the 6 univariate time series individually and concatenate the result after. \r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_basic_motions\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.catch22 import Catch22\r\nBM_X_train, BM_y_train = load_basic_motions(split=\"train\", return_X_y=True)\r\nprint(BM_X_train.shape, BM_X_train.iloc[0,0].shape)\r\nc22_mv = Catch22()\r\nc22_output = c22_mv.fit_transform(BM_X_train)\r\nprint(c22_output.shape, c22_output.iloc[0,0])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nI would expect the multivariate version of the implementation of catch22 to apply the feature extractions mehod to each of the 6 univariate time series individually and concatenate the result after.\r\nLike if I use a column transformer on each columns individually:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.compose import ColumnTransformer\r\ntransformer = ColumnTransformer(\r\n    transformers = [(str(i), Catch22(), [BM_X_train.columns[i]]) for i in range(BM_X_train.shape[1])]\r\n)\r\nc22_output = transformer.fit_transform(BM_X_train)\r\nprint(c22_output.shape, c22_output.iloc[0,0])\r\n```\r\nAlthought different format of the outputs could work as discussed here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1719\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem

PR introduces a pipeline object for time series classification where the last object is an `sklearn` classifier.\r\n\r\nDifferently from current pipeline constructs involving sklearn classifiers, this (a) inherits from `BaseClassifier` and hence also performs all the input checks and conversions, or can be used in further composition, and (b) also allows for both series-to-primitives and series-to-series transformers to be chained.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the tests are still failing due to use of `SummaryTransformer` as series-to-primitives, and its issue with output signature in case of a multivariate input object, see also discussion in #1719 and todos in #2717.\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2720 due to use of `SummaryTransformer` for testing multivariate time series classifiers pipelines (7 of 9 files touched are due to #2720).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6698238388,"node_id":"CE_lADOCVKAsc4__dcizwAAAAGPPwG0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/6698238388","actor":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-29T12:30:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
