**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen fitting prophet with exogenous data, the wrapper changes the argument `X` resulting in some issues; you can't use the same variable X as argument twice since it'll contain the column name `ds` after the first run, so you need to create copies at each occurence. \r\nIt gets worse when you do a `fit_predict` since the X changes internally (because of `fit`), when `fit_predict` calls `predict`, it raises an error that you can't work around with copies.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.fbprophet import Prophet\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ny_train = pd.Series(np.arange(1,21), index=pd.date_range(start='1/1/2021', end='20/1/2021'))\r\nX_train = pd.DataFrame(data=np.arange(1,21), columns=['something'], index=pd.date_range(start='1/1/2021', end='20/1/2021'))\r\n\r\narima_forecaster = Prophet()\r\narima_forecaster.fit_predict(fh=y_train.index, y=y_train, X=X_train)\r\nprint(X_train)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Traceback**\r\n```\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-4-30650cb58dc7> in <module>()\r\n      7 \r\n      8 arima_forecaster = Prophet()\r\n----> 9 arima_forecaster.fit_predict(fh=y_train.index, y=y_train, X=X_train)\r\n     10 print(X_train)\r\n\r\n3 frames\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_fbprophet.py in _merge_X(df, X)\r\n    197     X.columns = X.columns.astype(str)\r\n    198     if \"ds\" in X.columns:\r\n--> 199         raise ValueError(\"Column name 'ds' is reserved in fbprophet\")\r\n    200     X.loc[:, \"ds\"] = X.index\r\n    201     # df = df.merge(X, how=\"inner\", on=\"ds\", copy=False)\r\n\r\nValueError: Column name 'ds' is reserved in fbprophet\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nto fit and predict without changing arguments so that it can fit_predict without

PR introduces a class `TestScenario` which models a script to run methods sequentially with certain arguments and retrieve the outcome, plus a check whether the script is applicable to an object (e.g., estimator).\r\n\r\nThis addresses a deficiency in the current testing framework, in that unit tests can retrieve only a single argument combination per estimator scitype, via the `_make_fit_args` etc family of functions.\r\n\r\nThis limitation prevents addressing a few existing and future testing requirements:\r\n\r\n* testing two subsequent `fit` calls with different arguments, #1613. The current tests are incapable of passing two different sets of arguments to the same method.\r\n* testing forecasters both with only `y` argument and with `y` and `X` argument #1674. The current tests did not detect side effects on `X` since only `y` were passed, and it is not possible to use two different sets of arguments.\r\n* the transformer refactor which allows all transformers to accept both `Series` and `Panel` inputs, requiring us to test both types of inputs #1740. This would be very hard in the current framework.\r\n* same for extending forecasters to global/hierarchical #1683 (or #1684), which will also see forecasters accepting multiple input scitypes, `Series` and `Panel` and `Hierarchical`.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the class would be used to replace existing testing functionality, and write new tests easily.\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains tests for the `TestScenario` functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1078562820","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1674#issuecomment-1078562820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1674","id":1078562820,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCVKAsc5ASZAE","user":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-25T01:22:33Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T01:22:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"This
