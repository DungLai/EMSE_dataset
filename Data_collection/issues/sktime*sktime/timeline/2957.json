for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nPartial solution to Issue #2860\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nImplement an adapter to convert multiindex format to ListDataset in gluon-ts\r\nThe method takes as input a pd-multiindex DataFrame, (optional) a list of categorical feature, (optional) the startdate and (optional) frequency of the dataset. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nDependency: gluon-ts\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nTesting with different dataset in sktime to weed out the bugs. So far, Arrowhead, ItalyPoowerDemand and [StandWalkJump](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php) have been tested.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for

broder explanation of minimizing dependencies, references to literature such as sklearn etc.\r\n\r\nThis got deleted, so readers of this thread who want context may like to look at the first post in

the discussion into this topic and have a general discussion on dependency minimization in sktime and how this should be acchieved.\r\n\r\n- Numba: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3567\r\n-

use `X` as a placeholder for the hard dependency libraries currently used in scikit-time, with $X \\in \\{scipy, numba, sklearn, statemodel, pandas\\}$\r\n\r\n@fkiraly is a strong advocate of soft dependencies. Arguments following the argumentation line of @fkiraly: \r\n\r\n> I think we should turn `X` into a soft dependency, since it is not core to the framework, but used only in specific estimators.\r\n\r\nSee above issues for his precise argumentation line.\r\n\r\n<hr> \r\n\r\n**I @patrickzib believe we should have a broader discussion. The whole discussion is centered around soft-dependencies and numba.
