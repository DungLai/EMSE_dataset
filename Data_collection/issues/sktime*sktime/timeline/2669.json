But most of them became faster after changing ExpandinWindowSplitter(). I think you are creating too many samples, you can check this with `cv.get_n_splits(y_playbook)`. I think, if you don't define `initial_window` parameter in ExpandingWindowSplitter() it uses default of 10. So you start cv sampling from: cv_sample1 - train:[1,2...10] test[11], cv_sample2 - train[2,3,...11] test[12] and so on. \r\n\r\nAnd would be better if you can share also how long does it take actually by using `time` package around the computationally expensive line.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/comments/1133218749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"indinewton","id":25198189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk4MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25198189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton","html_url":"https://github.com/indinewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indinewton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7043845161,"node_id":"LE_lADOCVKAsc5KGWJCzwAAAAGj2Iwp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/events/7043845161","actor":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T06:52:57Z","label":{"name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
