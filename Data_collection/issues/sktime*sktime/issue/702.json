Please describe.**\r\nI would like to detect outliers in time series data.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI have seen the [Time Series Annotation](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/master/steps/06_time_series_annotation/step.md) enhancement proposal, however we actually could just have classes which inherit from `_SeriesToSeriesTransformer` and fill outliers with `np.nan` values. Then the outlier correction could happen by means of the `Imputer` I recently added.\r\n\r\nI would like to add different outlier detection classes (maybe with a common parent class), which could be placed in `sktime.transformations.series.outlier`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nImplementing the annotation module from scratch, because for probabilistic outlier detection we would need to return an additional column (so a `pd.DataFrame`) with the probabilities for each time point. This could however be solved with above solution in having a `threshold` argument which takes a probability value to decide if a point is an outlier or not.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/702/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/702/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
