Please describe.**\r\nThe `evaluate` function is very helpful for cross validation with sliding time windows. However as far as I can tell it requires that you internally train the model, as even if you use the \"update\" strategy, the first window trains the model. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt should let you pass in an already trained model. If this was the case, then it should also be possible to only pass in a \"test set\", because no training needs to be done internally, and it could just produce a forecast on every window within the test set. Right now it is kind of awkward to figure out what your \"initial window\" of the `ExpandingWindowSplitter` needs to be, it seems preferable to just define a forecast horizon and step size and run on the entirety of the test set, if your model is already trained. This is much more amenable to typical train/test workflows most people use outside the `evaluate` workflow.\r\n\r\nFinally, there should be an option to return the model that was trained within the evaluator.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNot sure of existing alternatives, I will happily implement these fixes in a PR if I get feedback that they would make sense and be an improvement.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chillerobscuro","id":5232872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5232872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro","html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
