This leads to unexpected behaviour and non-compliant predictions when `update_predict` is called a second time.\r\n\r\nThis is due to a fundamental bug in the design of the `detached_cutoff` that is used internally.\r\n\r\nAn example is the test failure in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2248, in combination with #2555.\r\n\r\nAnother minimal example of this behaviour is this, in #2248:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing.series import _make_series\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import BaggingForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import SlidingWindowSplitter\r\n\r\nX = _make_series()\r\nX1 = X[:24]\r\nX2 = X[24:36]\r\nf = BaggingForecaster.create_test_instance()\r\nf.fit(X1, fh=[1, 2])\r\n\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(start_with_window=False)\r\nf.update_predict(X2, cv=cv)\r\nf.update_predict(X2, cv=cv)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is that returns of both `update_predict` are identical, and that the `cutoff` of the internal estimator does not change.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
