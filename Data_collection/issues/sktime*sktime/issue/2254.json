This is a `str` or list of `str`, of codes in `feature_names`. If passed, the transformer will calculate only those features.\r\n* `X_inner_mtype` should also accept `pd.DataFrame`, i.e., a single series (in which case no loop is run over instances)\r\n* the docstring should describe all parameters properly.\r\n\r\nGood first issue, I think - most of these changes should be straightforward, albeit a bit fiddly.\r\n\r\nBonus: `_transform` works for multivariate input, output `pd.DataFrame` columns are `pd.Multiindex` named `(variable_name, feature_name)`. Not advised to do this in the first PR, this may be fiddly.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
