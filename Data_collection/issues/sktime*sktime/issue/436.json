Please describe.**\r\nI was working on a project and ran the AutoARIMA model ,which took long time to finish ,and could not get a sense of how long would it takes or at which stage the algorithm is currently running.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHere are some suggestions:\r\n1. Calculating the complexity of the algorithm ( O(N) ) and multiplying it by the length of data/parameters.\r\n2. Performing trials on different datasets with recording its execution time and averaging it ( Two routes: 1- Since hardware are different, the algorithm could perform a small test with a built-in dataset to infer the execution time from it. 2- By doing the trials on bunches of computers and averaging)\r\n3. Or simply by printing after each stage or updating a bar with that stage.","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
