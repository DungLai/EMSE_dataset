So I thought it may be a good idea to use `sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV` to do some hyperparameters tuning with specified dataset.\r\n\r\nBut I read documents of `sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV` and `sktime`, with many attempts, I found a conflict occurred when CV in `sklearn` requires the parameter `y` in `fit` should support safe split used index set (e.g. something like `(train_indexes,test_indexs)`), where the index set (e.g. `[[...]]`) must make the corresponding y_train become a dataframe with shape `(1,1)` instead of a `pd.Series`.\r\n\r\nI have not figured out any solution to deal with it so far. If such a dummy dataframe can be accepted as y_train, maybe some troubles will go away.\r\n\r\nCan I add this feature in code and create a pull request?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
