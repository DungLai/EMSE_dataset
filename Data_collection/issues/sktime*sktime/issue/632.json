In `ForecastingGridSearchCV` since the window data gets appended to the `initial_window`, the number of splits should be far less than the one reported in the example below\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\ny = load_airline()\r\n\r\nfh = np.arange(1, 13)\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=len(fh))\r\nprint(y.shape, y_train.shape[0], y_test.shape[0])\r\n\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(initial_window=int(len(y_train) * 0.5), start_with_window=True)\r\n\r\nregressor = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)\r\nforecaster = ReducedRegressionForecaster(regressor=regressor, strategy=\"recursive\")\r\n\r\nparam_grid = {\"regressor__n_estimators\": [200, 300]}\r\n\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(forecaster=forecaster, cv=cv, param_grid=param_grid, verbose=1)\r\ngscv.fit(y_train)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(144,) 132 12\r\nFitting 122 folds for each of 2 candidates, totalling 244 fits\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWith an internal window length of 10 being used, I would have expected the following\r\n\r\n**Number of folds** \r\n  = len(validation data) - window_length\r\n  = len(y_train) - initial_window - window_length\r\n  = 132 - 66 - 10\r\n  = **56 folds (expected)** but output shows 122 folds.\r\n\r\nBelow image is for illustration only (does not match the exact number of points in this example)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/105842028-39d8a100-5f9b-11eb-840d-1ace9c50d801.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.12 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Sep  9 2020, 00:29:25) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nexecutable: C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\.conda\\envs\\sktime_dev\\python.exe\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.18362-SP0\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 20.3.3\r\n   setuptools: 51.0.0.post20201207\r\n      sklearn: 0.24.0\r\n       sktime: 0.5.1\r\n  statsmodels: 0.12.1\r\n        numpy: 1.19.4\r\n        scipy: 1.5.4\r\n       Cython: 0.29.17\r\n       pandas: 1.1.5\r\n   matplotlib: 3.3.3\r\n       joblib: 1.0.0\r\n        numba: 0.52.0\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.0\r\n      tsfresh: 0.17.0\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
