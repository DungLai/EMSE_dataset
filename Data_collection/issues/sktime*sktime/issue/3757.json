Fitting (which is not performed in parallel) works as expected; transforming raises an unexpected error about the dataset's type/shape: `TypeError: No matching definition for argument type(s) array(float32, 2d, C), Tuple(readonly array(int32, 1d, C), readonly array(int32, 1d, C), readonly array(float32, 1d, C))` . I've seen issues related to this error before, just none in this context.\r\n\r\nI've manually confirmed that the data passed into the minirocket transformer looks structurally identical at both `.fit()` and `.transform()` calls, and wasn't able to identify any ways that `ray` was modifying the data under the hood when it called transform in parallel. I've already filed an issue there — https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/30178 — but am cross-posting here, because I'm unsure about which side of the fence the actual error is arising.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport random\r\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport ray.data\r\nimport sklearn.base\r\nfrom sktime.datatypes._panel._convert import from_2d_array_to_nested\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel import rocket\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyPreprocessor(ray.data.Preprocessor):\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def estimator(self) -> sklearn.base.BaseEstimator:\r\n        return rocket.MiniRocket()\r\n\r\n    def _fit(self, dataset: ray.data.Dataset) -> ray.data.Preprocessor:\r\n        X = dataset.to_pandas()\r\n        self.estimator_ = self.estimator.fit(X, None)\r\n        return self\r\n\r\n    def _transform_pandas(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\r\n        return self.estimator_.transform(df)\r\n\r\n\r\ndf = (\r\n    pd.DataFrame(\r\n        columns=[str(i) for i in range(10)],\r\n        data=[[random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(100)],\r\n    )\r\n    .pipe(from_2d_array_to_nested)\r\n    .rename(columns={0: \"ts\"})\r\n)\r\ndataset = ray.data.from_pandas(df)\r\npreprocessor = MyPreprocessor().fit(dataset)\r\n\r\n_ = preprocessor._transform_pandas(dataset.to_pandas())  # OK\r\n_ = [preprocessor._transform_pandas(batch) for batch in dataset.iter_batches()]  # OK\r\n_ = dataset.map_batches(preprocessor._transform_pandas)  # FAILS!\r\n_ = preprocessor.transform(dataset)  # FAILS!\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI should be able to transform the data using minirocket when it's split up into \"batches\" and executed in parallel.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.9.13 (main, Jul  7 2022, 11:59:57)  [Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)]\r\nexecutable: /Users/burtondewilde/.pyenv/versions/3.9.13/envs/foo/bin/python3.9\r\n   machine: macOS-12.4-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.3\r\n   setuptools: 58.1.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.1.3\r\n       sktime: 0.13.4\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.21.6\r\n        scipy: 1.8.1\r\n       pandas: 1.4.4\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.2\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.56.3\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"patrickzib","id":7783034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODMwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7783034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib","html_url":"https://github.com/patrickzib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
