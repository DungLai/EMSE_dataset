you can't use the same variable X as argument twice since it'll contain the column name `ds` after the first run, so you need to create copies at each occurence. \r\nIt gets worse when you do a `fit_predict` since the X changes internally (because of `fit`), when `fit_predict` calls `predict`, it raises an error that you can't work around with copies.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.fbprophet import Prophet\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ny_train = pd.Series(np.arange(1,21), index=pd.date_range(start='1/1/2021', end='20/1/2021'))\r\nX_train = pd.DataFrame(data=np.arange(1,21), columns=['something'], index=pd.date_range(start='1/1/2021', end='20/1/2021'))\r\n\r\narima_forecaster = Prophet()\r\narima_forecaster.fit_predict(fh=y_train.index, y=y_train, X=X_train)\r\nprint(X_train)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Traceback**\r\n```\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-4-30650cb58dc7> in <module>()\r\n      7 \r\n      8 arima_forecaster = Prophet()\r\n----> 9 arima_forecaster.fit_predict(fh=y_train.index, y=y_train, X=X_train)\r\n     10 print(X_train)\r\n\r\n3 frames\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_fbprophet.py in _merge_X(df, X)\r\n    197     X.columns = X.columns.astype(str)\r\n    198     if \"ds\" in X.columns:\r\n--> 199         raise ValueError(\"Column name 'ds' is reserved in fbprophet\")\r\n    200     X.loc[:, \"ds\"] = X.index\r\n    201     # df = df.merge(X, how=\"inner\", on=\"ds\", copy=False)\r\n\r\nValueError: Column name 'ds' is reserved in fbprophet\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nto fit and predict without changing arguments so that it can fit_predict without error\r\n\r\n> **Versions**\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.7.12 (default, Sep 10 2021, 00:21:48)  [GCC 7.5.0]\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\r\n   machine: Linux-5.4.104+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 21.1.3\r\n   setuptools: 57.4.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.1\r\n       sktime: 0.8.1\r\n  statsmodels: 0.10.2\r\n        numpy: 1.19.5\r\n        scipy: 1.4.1\r\n       Cython: 0.29.24\r\n       pandas: 1.1.5\r\n   matplotlib: 3.2.2\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.54.1\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1673/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
