thought it worth spelling out the structure of how people can use and implement classification algorithms in sktime. The balance is between modularity and efficiency. This is summarising what we have, but I think it worth it as a we try to widen the development base. \r\n\r\nModular approach:\r\nI propose two classifiers as pipelines\r\nTimeSeriesEnsemble (or time_series_ensemble? need to resolve naming conventions. Another ticket!). This pipeline is a set of transforms and an estimator/classifier as the last element. The logic is that the transforms are applied independently to each member of the ensemble, and the final estimator is the base classifier for the ensemble. The transformers are *not* applied sequentially. They are applied independently to the data and the results are concatenated. They must be Randomizable, so that a different transform is applied for each ensemble member. The transformers and the base classifier should be seedable for reproducability.
