On it, it fits a regressor of forecasts against actual.\r\n\r\nWhat this results in is, for a `fh` of length `1`, in a fit on a single data point.\r\nThat seems completely nonsensical.\r\nThere is also no scientific reference cited for the algorithm.\r\n\r\nWhat it should probably be doing instead is using a rolling window splitter, tabulate the forecasts at the same horizon, over train/test pairs, fit a regressor per forecast horizon, and apply that in the forecast.\r\n\r\nI am also listed as author, but I only refactored it to the new interface without looking at the algorithm in detail (as I was assuming that the above one is carried out).\r\n\r\nFYI @indinewton, have you looked at it?
