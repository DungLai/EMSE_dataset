Any logic for retrieval should be provided in there, or a private version `_get_fitted_params`, rather than in \"populate\" functions.\r\n \r\n---\r\nOld API suggestion\r\n\r\nBoth should behave precisely like `scikit-learn`'s `get_params`, except that parameters are looked up in dedicated dictionaries `reports` and `fitted_params` rather than in self-attributes that correspond to `__init__` named arguments.\r\n\r\n`fit` or `__init__` could populate these dictionaries, this could happen by `_populate_fitted_params` and `_populate_summary` private interfaces called at the end of `fit` (the non-private with the \"plumbing\" logic), which is specific to individual estimators/objects, or directly in `_fit` (not sure which is the better convention?).\r\n\r\nFor functionality, I think we can copy-paste `scikit-learn`'s `get_params` code here, and adapt it by making the change in where parameters are being retrieved. This would ensure nested access, which for example `get_fitted_params` doesn't have at current.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n@mloning, @aiwalter, @RNKuhns, @ltsaprounis","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
