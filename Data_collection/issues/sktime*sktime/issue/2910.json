What is the maximum number of dimensions?\r\n3) The section \"Representing data with .ts files\" talks about the differences between a @timeStamps label of True and False. A possible update would be to add headings (i.e. @timeStamps=True and @timeStamps=False) with the relevant description for each condition below its respective heading.\r\n4) As far as I understand, the word `obser` refers to `observation`. \r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @hilal-g in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1447#issuecomment-1172882113_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
