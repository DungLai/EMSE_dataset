If it equal length, X is loaded into a ndarray\r\n    1.1 if univariate, X is loaded into a 2D array\r\n    1.2 if multivariate,  X is loaded into a 3D array\r\n2. If unequal length, X is loaded into a nested dataframe.\r\n3. y should always return an 1D array\r\nthis can be done on top of existing code, so should be backward compatible. However, the loading itself could be tidier. We should separate the task of loading the meta data from the task of loading the data, and the meta data should be used to choose which option to load. \r\n\r\nI think this it will make it much clearer whats going on and allow examples more aligned with sklearn. Once complete, we can revise the example notebooks \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
