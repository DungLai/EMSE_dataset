This may be more important for bug-fixing PRs but is also relevant to PRs related to code enhancements.\r\n\r\nIt is considered good practice to add tests with newly added code to enforce the fact that the code actually works. This will reduce the chance of introducing logical bugs which often escape tests that only check for spec compliance\r\n\r\nThis line will serve as a cue for the author to add tests to ensure that further changes to these files won't introduce the same kind of bug. \r\n\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTell us how we could improve the documentation in this regard.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n``` md\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Did you add any tests?\r\n\r\n<! -- It is considered good practice to add tests whenever a new piece of code is added. While we don't mandate them, we encourage our contributors to add new tests to reduce the chance of introducing logical bugs. -->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.
