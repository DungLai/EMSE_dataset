Getting multistep prediction intervals in cases where only the 1-step forecast variance is available. e.g. https://otexts.com/fpp3/ets-forecasting.html\r\n2. Intervals of temporal aggregations of forecasts. https://otexts.com/fpp3/aggregates.html\r\n\r\nA lot of packages that we have wrappers for already have this functionality: \r\n1. [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.exponential_smoothing.ets.ETSResults.simulate.html)\r\n2. [prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/blob/419ee68ac6b218b7a3f06a9ddaa6bc08041be1d6/python/prophet/forecaster.py#L1445)\r\n\r\nFor the above, we can interface this method directly.\r\n\r\nFor other models we can use our native `predict_proba` and sample from the one-step ahead distribution to create multiple sample paths.\r\n\r\nexample from a statsmodels protoype: \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.ets import AutoETS\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.utils.plotting import plot_series\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nforecaster = AutoETS()\r\nforecaster.fit(y)\r\n\r\ny_hat = forecaster.simulate(np.arange(1,12)) \r\n\r\ndisplay(y_hat)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64217214/191759562-65b4e5ca-119b-4bd9-ac25-d167bb281197.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
