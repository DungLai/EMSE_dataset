Essentially, one would get a `UnboundLocalError` if they try to load regression data with timestamps. This is due to imperfect loading logic in `_data_io.py`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\nAssuming there's a `AppliancesEnergy.ts`(a regression data with timestamps, available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3902637#.YzlFp3ZBxEY)) in the same level as the code below\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_from_tsfile\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    file_location = \"AppliancesEnergy.ts\"\r\n\r\n    X, y = load_from_tsfile(file_location)\r\n    print(X)\r\n    print(\"----\"*25)\r\n    print(y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of above:\r\n``` python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"temp_bug_test.py\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    X, y = load_from_tsfile(file_location)\r\n  File \"D:\\Projects\\sktime\\sktime\\sktime\\datasets\\_data_io.py\", line 383, in load_from_tsfile\r\n    X, y = load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe(\r\n  File \"D:\\Projects\\sktime\\sktime\\sktime\\datasets\\_data_io.py\", line 618, in load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe\r\n    if class_val not in class_label_list:\r\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'class_label_list' referenced before assignment\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nThe code should produce X and y.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\nThe problem is due to the fact that there's a `class_label_list` that is to be built when metadata is read. For classification datasets with timestamps, all possible values of labels are provided with `@classlabel`. Of course, that's not possible for regression data. Therefore this list is never built.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n1. (Easy Method): Add a boolean variable which is `True` for regression data (easy to know depending if `@classlabel` is found or `@targetlabel` is found). If this variable is true, then the concerned `if` statement is skipped.\r\n2. (Correct Method?): Re-evaluate the logic of how data is being loaded, possibly restructure the code and related assumptions. Possibly plenty of work.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 05:59:00) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nexecutable: D:\\Anaconda\\envs\\sktime-dev\\python.exe\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.22000-SP0\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.2.2\r\n   setuptools: 59.8.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.1.2\r\n       sktime: 0.13.4\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.22.4\r\n        scipy: 1.8.1\r\n       pandas: 1.4.4\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.3\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.56.2\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.5\r\n      tsfresh: 0.19.0\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
