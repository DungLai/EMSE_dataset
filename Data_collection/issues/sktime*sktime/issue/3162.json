We found that for some unstable series (with outliers, mainly), the forecast performance of this model degrades by many orders of magnitude compared with other implementations (R and `StatsForecast`). I believe the problem is related to the `statsmodels` implementation (https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/8344) (see, for example, the following table using the M4 dataset).  \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1043\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10517170/182445444-9d4d9490-924f-4bea-b1b5-02f2c513a316.png\">\r\n\r\nAs additional preprocessing must be done for this type of unstable series, I think it would be very positive for the users if a warning about the use of the model was included in the documentation, particularly for fitting multiple time series.\r\n\r\nOur [results](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/tree/main/experiments/ets) suggest that our version is more robust than current alternatives. If you are interested, I could work on including this version in `sktime`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3162/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
