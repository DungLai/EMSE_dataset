Say hello [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sktime-group/shared_invite/zt-62i7aejn-vXc3nOWF26S_P3VXFPWisQ) and get set up for development, see [instructions in the developer guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/developer_guide.html)\r\n2. Pick a “good first issue” to work on, see a collection [in this summary issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1147), or from [this list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue)\r\nsuggestion: pick something small with simple content to learn the “process”\r\n3. Feel free to attend the regular community collab sessions or one of the topic specific stand-ups and tech sessions (see schedule on slack)\r\n4. Once your first PR is merged and you’ve seen how things work, think about your regular time commitment. Optionally, continue attending the Friday community collaboration sessions and stand-ups; or, optionally, [apply for mentoring](https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/README.md)\r\n\r\n### introductory and user testing\r\n\r\n* work through the [sktime tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) and record feedback, you can post it in this issue #1447\r\n* work through user testing sheets for [forecasting](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_forecasting.ipynb) or [time series classification](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/blob/main/sktime_worksheet_TSC.ipynb), record feedback and send us your user testing sheet with code (e.g., attach to this issue)\r\n* open an issue with a time series related algorithm that you would like to see implemented or interfaced in `sktime`\r\n* work through the [installation instructions](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/installation.html) to install a development version of `sktime`. Record carefully things that are unclear or don't work as described, return the full feedback to us (e.g., in an issue).\r\n\r\n### contributors new to open source\r\n\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing module and class/function docstrings. Pick a file and start adding these. A good starting point are estimator algorithms, these should follow the general documentation style outlined in #1148 or the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). If you start, post the name of the estimator you are working on in #1148; when you open a PR, refer to the issue.\r\n* documentation: many code files are missing examples. Pick a file and start adding these. a good starting point are estimator algorithms, and time series classifiers, see #932 and #1148\r\n\r\nNOTE: #1148 and #932 are closed, but there are still modules without good docstrings. They are just no longer tracked by the issue, which covered the priority items only. So, feel free to go through the code base and help improve docstrings!\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium documentation and technical writing tasks\r\n\r\n* other smaller issues in the [documentation milestone](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/milestone/6)\r\n* the [user guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/user_guide.html) is incomplete. Help is appreciated - the best approach may be converting the [tutorials](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) in a well-written guide.\r\n* the [tutorial for time series classification](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) should be re-factored, in the style of the forecasting tutorial\r\n* extension templates for time series regression and time series annotation should be written. The current [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates) can be used as an extension template template.\r\n\r\n### small-to-medium python/coding tasks\r\n\r\n* current open small tasks with a \"recipe\": https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/3429\r\n* pick an unverified bug from the bugfixing board: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/projects/18 and try to reproduce it. Post operating system, python version and (if relevant) package versions, and whether you can yes/no. Investigate further if the bug looks simple - but note that bugs can be anywhere between easy to very difficult to track down.\r\n* Pick an algorithm to implement or interface, according to the [extension templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates). Possible choices are forecasters (univariate or multivariate), time series classifiers, time series regressors, annotators, distances, kernels - these can be existing feature requests, or new suggestions. We currently do not recommend transformers as they undergo refactoring.\r\n* implement `get_fitted_params` functionality in estimators where this is missing (currently most of them). Related issue for composite estimators: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1497\r\n\r\n### mid to longer term tasks\r\n\r\nFor contributing across a period of weeks or months, consider joining one of the major workstreams and weekly stand-ups on Fridays.
