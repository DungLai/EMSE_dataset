Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIf a developer does not return a correct machine type, the test suite can break with cryptic error messages.\r\n\r\nE.g. see this PR https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3338. In this example, the mistake by developer is they outputted a list instead of a sktime compatible mtype. the error message they get is `NoneType object is not subscriptable` (which refers to `metadata` being None, which happens because in line 948, `check_is_mtype()` is called and returns None for metadata). To debug requires developer to dig into the nitty gritty of base class, which is not ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nInclude output checks with helpful error messages. E.g. in transformer base class, it looks like we *assume* developer does everything correctly, so we never check `Xt` has appropriate mtype.\r\n\r\nMaybe as part of `_convert_output`, or as separate method before calling `_convert_output`.\r\n\r\nWould need to check which base classes this effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3369/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
