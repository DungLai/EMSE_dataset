Please describe.**\r\nWhen benchmarking datasets with many series, we may want to compute the average score for all backtesting windows. If different series have different lengths, they will likely have different counts of backtest windows, and the overall mean score will suffer from sampling bias.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nBe able to pass `n_splits` to `ExpandingWindowSplitter` and `SlidingWindowSplitter`, so that regardless of input series length we will know how many windows will be computed for each series. The function would require `series`, `fh`, `n_splits`, and could optionally still accept `initial_window`. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIn the backtesting loop, the user could compute the window params based on the series length for each series themselves.\r\n\r\nThis work is inspired by @topher-lo's work on parellelizing the `evaluate` function, and he has already shared some code for computing window sizes and season periods based on the series `freq` attribute.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3651/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
