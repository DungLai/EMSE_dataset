In a clean virtual environment, create this requirements.txt file:\r\n```\r\nscipy==1.9.2\r\nsktime==0.13.4\r\n```\r\n2. Install the requirements with pip:\r\n```\r\n% pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bug**:\r\n```\r\nCollecting scipy==1.9.2\r\n  Using cached scipy-1.9.2-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl (34.2 MB)\r\nCollecting sktime==0.13.4\r\n  Using cached sktime-0.13.4-py3-none-any.whl (7.0 MB)\r\nCollecting numpy<1.26.0,>=1.18.5\r\n  Using cached numpy-1.23.4-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl (18.1 MB)\r\nCollecting statsmodels>=0.12.1\r\n  Using cached statsmodels-0.13.2-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl (9.7 MB)\r\nCollecting deprecated>=1.2.13\r\n  Using cached Deprecated-1.2.13-py2.py3-none-any.whl (9.6 kB)\r\nINFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of <Python from Requires-Python> to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.\r\nINFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of scipy to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.\r\nERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 2) and scipy==1.9.2 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe conflict is caused by:\r\n    The user requested scipy==1.9.2\r\n    sktime 0.13.4 depends on scipy<1.9.0\r\n\r\nTo fix this you could try to:\r\n1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified\r\n2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI would expect the latest release versions of scipy and sktime to be mutually compatible, given they are likely to frequently be used together.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI could take a stab at the fix, but I would need someone to explain the why behind the upper bound in [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/pyproject.toml), so I know what to replace it with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"scipy<1.9.0\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm assuming there's some implicit SemVer policy behind the upper bound, though it could be something else, like sktime depends on implicit behavior in scipy in a way that breaks with the latest version. If it's the latter case, this is probably beyond my scope, since this would be my first contribution.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n\r\nN/A: You can't actually run `show_versions` when the package install fails.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
