The difference operator must exclude the first index from both exogenous and endogenous variable (because I have specified this transformation both in ForecastingPipeline and TransformedTargetForecaster), but when I call the fit method this error raise: \r\n\r\n(time) indices of series 0 are not contained in index of series 0, extra indices are: DatetimeIndex(['2016-01-31'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n\r\nwhere 2016-01-31 is the first index.
