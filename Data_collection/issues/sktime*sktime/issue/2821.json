Please describe.**\r\nRefer to #2777 \r\n\r\nOpenML is a benchmarking framework that allows ML experiments to be reproduced easily and transparently. Each dataset and task has a unique ID that is share-able, allowing other users to repeat the same task on the same dataset. At the moment, it has limited support for time series dataset. It will be beneficial to investigate its potential to host sktime's dataset and our benchmark tasks.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA demonstration of implementation of sktime to OpenML. Or demonstration why it is not possible.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nKotsu #2804 and Gluon-ts\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TNTran92","id":55965636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTY1NjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92","html_url":"https://github.com/TNTran92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
