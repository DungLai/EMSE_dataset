We therefore may want to extend the function so it works with unequal time index.\r\n\r\nmtypes that are currently not supported can be dealt with by an initial conversion, similar to how it is handled in `get_window`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
