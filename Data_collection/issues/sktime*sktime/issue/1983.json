Currently, the data loaders in _single_problem_loaders either return a pd.Series or a nested pd.DataFrame. I would like to change this so that they return the best data structure for the problem: for multiple instance problems (aka panel data), univariate equal length should return 2D numpy, multivariate equal length 3D numpy, unequal length should return nested pandas.\r\n\r\nThis is part of my general push to reduce entry barriers to classification. Nested dataframes confuse people, and now all classifiers and clusterers can handle numpy through their base classes, and the data loader is configurable via load_from_tsfile, would like to promote numpy use where ever possible.
