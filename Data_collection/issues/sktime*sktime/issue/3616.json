This results in a bunch of `AssertionError`s only for DL estimators. I conducted a diagnostic run via #3611 and found that the degree to which they differ is vastly different. \r\n\r\nFor example, In the case of `CNNClassifer`'s `predict_proba`, the values don't seem to be [very far apart](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/actions/runs/3279479559/jobs/5399198702#step:7:1192). \r\n\r\nOn the opposite end, we have something like `CNNRegressor`'s `predict`, where the values are [too far off](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/actions/runs/3279479559/jobs/5399198702#step:7:1527).\r\n\r\nInitially, this test was skipped for all DL estimators. So that's probably why this went undiagnosed for so long.\r\n\r\nEdit: This error is also sporadic in nature, ie. it doesn't always fail. This can be seen after checking the new failures after skipping all the problematic estimators [here](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/actions/runs/3283046621). This also means that all estimators are affected (which implies probably the source is not from estimators).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
