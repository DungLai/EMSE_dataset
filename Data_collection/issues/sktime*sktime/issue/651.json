Please describe.**\r\nArising from the call on Feb 2 on forecasting model selection & evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe multiplexer is a component that allows easy tuning for selection over a list of estimators with potentially distinct parameters\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe high-behaviour is as follows.\r\n\r\nThe multiplexer takes a named list (dict) of components at initialization, `components`.\r\nIt also has a single `select` parameter that should be identical to one of the componentsÂ´ names.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the estimator is identical to the component `components[select]`, the other components are ignored.\r\n\r\nWhy is this useful:\r\nthis is arising from a suggestion by @aiwalter that model selection should be possible over inhomogenous (not the same) estimators.\r\n\r\nBetter than the \"naive\" solution to write a custom grid search and random search is the solution to wrap a multiplexer in a tuner - this way, model selection can be done using any evaluation strategy, e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc.\r\n\r\n**Usage and implementation sketch**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Multiplexer\r\n    def __init__(self, components, select=None):\r\n        self.components = components\r\n        self.select = select\r\n        \r\n    def fit(self, ...):\r\n        self.components[select].fit(...)\r\n\r\n    def predict(self, ...):\r\n        self.components[select].predict(...)\r\n        \r\n    def update(self, ...):\r\n        self.components[select].update(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get model selection, one would then write the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmpx = Multiplexer({\"ARIMA\": ARIMA(sth), \"ExpS\": ExpSmoothing(sth)])\r\ngrid = {\"select\": [\"ARIMA\", \"ExpSmoothing\"]}\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(mpx, grid, ...)\r\n```\r\nA technical challenge might be to check whether this works well with nested `get_params`/`set_params`.\r\nEasy solution might just be to \"unpack\" the list in the constructor.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/651/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/651/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
