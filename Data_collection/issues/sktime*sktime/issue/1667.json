Please describe.**\r\n\r\nTemporal aggregation aggregates high-frequency time series into lower frequency time series using a fixed nonoverlapping window. For example, we can aggregate daily time series into weekly time series using a window of length 7. Temporal aggregation in different levels can strengthen or attenuate different features of the time series, and thus reveal import  information about the data generating process.\r\nCurrently, there are similar forecasting strategies such as `makereduction` using a overlapping sliding-window, but there are not similar methods in transformer.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd temporal aggregation transformer. User can specify the window (e.g. `6` for monthly time series to produce half-year time series)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTemporal aggregation has been explored widely in forecasting literatures. There are multiple forecasting methods(e.g. MAPA, iMAPA, ADIDA) that combine  forecasts from multiple aggregation levels, which improve forecasting accuracy and decrease uncertainty. But they cannot be implemented in sktime elegantly because aggregated series in different levels have different length, also see #230 and Unequal length data in roadmap  #228.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
