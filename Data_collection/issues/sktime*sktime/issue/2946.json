We do this in clustering and classification base class, it would be nice to store transform time in the BaseTransformer class\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\na class variable, e.g. transform_time, that is initialised in reset and calculated in fit after self._is_fitted = True \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nJust looking at a new transformer and we are currently calculating it in _fit, there is not a currently standard way of doing this so it would be good to shove it up into Base.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2946/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
