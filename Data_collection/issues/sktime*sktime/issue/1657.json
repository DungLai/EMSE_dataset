Reproduce**\r\nRun\r\n\r\n```bash\r\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --inplace --execute --debug --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 examples/02_classification_univariate.ipynb\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCommand is succesfull.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nIn CI python 3.7 is used to run the notebook and the command executes successfully.\r\n\r\nI added a `--debug` flag and managed to narrow down the the cell that fail and it's\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.tsfresh import TSFreshFeatureExtractor\r\n\r\ntransformer = TSFreshFeatureExtractor(default_fc_parameters=\"minimal\")\r\nextracted_features = transformer.fit_transform(X_train)\r\nextracted_features.head() \r\n```\r\n\r\nMore specifically it is the call to `transform` method from `TSFreshFeatureExtractor` that kills the kernel.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n\r\nOS: linux mint\r\nPython: 3.8.10\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing!
