The failure is on `main`.\r\n\r\nEstimators in questions are:\r\n* `DrCIF`\r\n* `ShapeletTransformClassifier`\r\n* `TemporalDictionaryEnsemble`\r\n\r\nI have commented out the assertion, since, I suppose, stochastically the runtime of a single estimator component can be so high that the contract expires after the first component, so there isn't a good reason to expect that \"number estimator > 1\"? It should just be > 0 (which is tested indirectly already by asking for a prediction in the test suite).\r\n\r\nI am commenting the assertion out temporarily to keep failures from `main`, and leave this issue open to resolve this more systematically.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
