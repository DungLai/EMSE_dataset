From the code, it seems that the preferred method is to [use adapters](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/v0.5.1/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters), but I could not make out what the requirements are for the adpater. Something similar to [this](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html) would be helpful which will help guide what needs to be added to the adapter.\r\n\r\nIt looks like at least the `fit` method needs to be implemented, but [some adapters](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/v0.5.1/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_pmdarima.py) implement the `_predict` method while [others](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/v0.5.1/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_fbprophet.py) implement the `predict` method. I would greatly appreciate it if someone provide an overview of the requirements for these adapters?\r\n\r\nOne application could be to integrate some of the deep learning algorithms found in `darts` such as [this one](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/darts/models/nbeats.py), but I am sure there could be others that could be added as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/586/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
