Currently this is just done by substring search, so users can't see easily what the possible values are.\r\n- [ ] add display of tags. There may be some design that has to be done, since a display of 10-20 tags may blow up the table. E.g., a sub-selection has to be made, or that display may have to fold somehow to avoid having giant cells.\r\n- [ ] allow easy subsetting and search by tags, e.g., \"show me all multivariate forecasters\". Currently, this can be done using `all_estimators`, but not via the table.\r\n- [ ] add more tables *like* the estimator overview, which allow to list tags, or types of estimators. This table could be also linked from the estimator table. These tables already exist in the `registry` module, as output of `all_tags`, or as `BASE_CLASS_REGISTER`.\r\n- [ ] remove the legacy `ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md` and replace it with a link to the current estimator overview.\r\n- [ ] ideas from the legacy `ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md` which have not made it into the current estimator. Algorithm owners (from CODEOWNERS files); primary publication reference; listing reduction with a type that is \"from\" and \"to\". For each of these, there probably needs to be a bit of design how it should look like (and not clutter the tables).\r\n\r\nThe current estimator table is generated via `source.conf._make_estimator_overview`, which can be used as starting point.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1930/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
