Please describe.**\r\nBuilding forecast horizons might not be obvious to new users - I know if confused me a little at first. I imagine many users will simply want to specify the number of point predictions in the horizon and let the forecaster interpret that as it sees fit.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd something like the following to `sktime.utils.validation.forecasting.validate_fh`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif isinstance(fh, np.integer):\r\n    fh = np.arange(fh) + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen if I specify `fh = 20`, I would get back 20 point predictions that immediately follow the last observation in my training data. I don't believe this would break anything in the existing API.","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
