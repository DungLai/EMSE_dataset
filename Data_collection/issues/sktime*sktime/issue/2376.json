Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2333 I have generalized `ForecastingHorizon` to accept non-integer forecasting horizons, e.g. `pd.Timedelta`. The only method which is not adjusted is `ForecastingHorizon.to_indexer`. In the referenced PR it raises `NotImplementedError` instead. The main reason I left it at that is that personally I do not understand the meaning of this method for non-integer indices. Let's say we have a time series with the following date index: `[Jan 1, Jan 2, Jan 2, Jan 5]`. The integer index here is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. But if I start thinking in relative time-based terms, say `fh = 1 day`, and a `cutoff = Jan 2`, then indexing into the this time series is nothing but defining a time threshold and simply filtering out either values before or after this threshold, say `Jan 3`, or `y[y.index < cutoff + fh]`. In such arithmetic integer index is just not very helpful.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIf I saw the solution, I would have implemented it straight away. Unfortunately, I do not see one without digging deep into how this method is used in other places of the library.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
