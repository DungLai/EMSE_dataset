Please describe.**\r\nAs discussed in the daily-stand up on 05-07-12, I wanted to propose some enhancements / changes to CNN Classifier (and hence to Deep Learning based estimators)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- [ ] Moving the `convert_y_to_keras` function in `BaseDeepClassifier` into a utils function\r\n- [x] Enable returning the `label_encoder` and `one hot encoder` to the user from `convert_y_to_keras` (it can be useful for the users in case they want to use it to encode other data / or to decode data later on)\r\n- [x] Add option to have multiple linear layers in output layer / different activation function. Also add the `use_bias` parameter to output layer. (simply as a customisation option to users, multiple linear layers are useful to create deeper networks depending on dataset / choice of activation function)\r\n- [x] option to choose optimiser (usually its Adam but just for customisation's sake we can give this as option as well). Also should allow specifying `lr` either within the optimiser or as parameter to the class itself.\r\n- [x] Accept parameter as input in `CNNClassifier` to specify `random seed`\r\n- [ ] Train/fit the model on GPU depending on users choice (maybe take an input parameter for this as well)\r\n- [x] Option to view / return the loss of fit (either as a graph or simply as a list / array ) / A better idea is to add a summary function which can return model summary as well as `fit` history. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThese are some additional features / changes I wanted to add to the `CNNClasifier`. Any inputs / additional comments are appreciated  \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
