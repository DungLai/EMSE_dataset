Please describe.**\r\nWhen compared to the vast metric library that sklearn has, sktime is missing a great deal of structure. Additionally some of the metrics in Sktime are inconsistent with sklearn. See: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics for details on what sklearn has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn particular as someone working on the clustering side of sktime the metrics are imperative to many of the algorithms for both funcationality and offering evaluation. \r\n\r\nIf you consider the current directory of sktime we have distances, benchmarking, performance_metrics in the upper most level, then some plotting stuff in with the utils, some evaluation methods within a type of time series analysis (i.e. forecasting has model_evluation) and some like classifiction where it isn't obvius where the evaluation metrics are. Point being while this is working for now the inconsistency and departure from the structure of sklearn is confusing for both developers and users of the package.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMy proposal is a restructure of sktime so that model selection, classification metrics, regression metrics, forecasting metrics, clustering metrics, pairwise metrics (distances) and plotting are located under the sktime/metrics/ directory which is in line with sklearn. In addition to the restructure I would propose some parts (in particular distance metrics) are reworked and integrated with numba rather than cython for future ease of development (see http://numba.pydata.org/).\r\n\r\nIn particular I personally would like to prioritise working on the pairwise distance. Currently the distances I'm using for clustering  are located in distances/elastic.py and distances/elastic_cython.pyx. While these distance work and are very well optimised,  they don't follow the interface set out by sklearn (they do not allow for 2 1d arrays to be past). While im not propsing scrapping these overnight I believe overtime they should be redeveloped to follow sklearns interface and move to numba over Cython.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternativly without this structure I would just develop the distance and evaluation methods I need inside the sktime/clustering directory which further makes the structure of sktime confusing and inconsistent.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is a large proposal and restructure. However, I think if we do it incrementally we can get to a good point of consistency. In particular while talking with @TonyBagnall the distance metrics we agreed that accepting 1d arrays is a necessity for Sktime.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1062/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
