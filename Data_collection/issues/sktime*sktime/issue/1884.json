I'm wondering if there are any ways to weight the features differently. Like the DTW distance on one feature (single time series) is more important than other(another single timeseries).\r\n\r\nI checked the API documentation but couldn't find any. Please can you suggest on best way to approach this.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPraveen","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1884/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
