must have a classes_ attribute in order to be used in cross validation of the experiments / orchestration pipeline.

Indices are required for predict_proba context.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like this behaviour, classifiers should not be forced into having a specific field. Resolutions are:\r\n- Remove classes_ completely by using a different cross validation system\r\n- Let orchestration / experiment classes add the classes_ attribute to the classifier themselves, though this would cause the unlikely issue where a classifier already has a classes_ attribute which is nothing to do with label encoding.\r\n\r\nCan anyone think of any other resolutions?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
