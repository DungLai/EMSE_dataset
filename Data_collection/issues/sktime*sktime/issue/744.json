Please describe.**\r\nI want to be able to use `Imputer` and `HampelFilter` inside `TransformedTargetForecaster` to be able to tune them together with a forecaster. However, this is currently not possible because there is not `inverse_transform()` function implemented. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI have checked the `sklearn.Imputer` and they also dont have an `inverse_tranform`. My idea however is to just implement a dummy `inverse_tranform` function that does nothing, so just returning input as output.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts on implementing this:\r\nPRO\r\n- enable tuning\r\n\r\nCONTRA:\r\n- inverting would not lead to the same original data (but we could store the original data inside the transformer to be able to do this at least for the insample transformations). Otherwise we could just raise a warning that inverting `Imputer` or `HampelFilter` is not unambiguously.\r\n\r\nWould be interested in your opinion @mloning @fkiraly\r\n___\r\nMartin Walter <martin_friedrich.walter@daimler.com>, Mercedes-Benz AG on behalf of Daimler TSS GmbH.\r\nhttps://github.com/Daimler/daimler-foss/blob/master/LEGAL_IMPRINT.md\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
