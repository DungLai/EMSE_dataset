Let's call this convention B.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at delayed computation, it seems to me that convention A allows to have delayed chains of computations throughout pipelines without problems, assuming all pipeline elements support `dask`. Whereas, convention B would break the chain at every component.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think, we should reconsider our decision to move to convention B, and stay with convention A instead?\r\n\r\nFYI @topher-lo, @aiwalter - any thoughts?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3570/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
