It raises a type error \r\n\r\n\"X is not of a supported input data type.X must be in a supported mtype format for Panel, found <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\"\r\n\r\nthis is a problem because we often load the train and test and merge them together. This error also occurs with resampling dataloaded from file, this is the cut down version\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing.panel import _make_panel_X\r\nfrom sktime.classification.dummy import DummyClassifier\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\ntrainX = _make_panel_X(n_instances=40)\r\ntrainY = np.random.randint(low=0,high=2,size=40)\r\ndummy = DummyClassifier()\r\n# this works\r\ndummy.fit(trainX,trainY)\r\ntrainX2 = _make_panel_X(n_instances=40)\r\ntrainX2=pd.concat([trainX2,trainX])\r\ntrainY2 = np.random.randint(low=0,high=2,size=80)\r\n# this throws a type error\r\ndummy.fit(trainX2,trainY2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThis code works with version 0.13.0 and lower, but throws the above error in 0.13.1. \r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9594042/191950092-33d72f76-898c-4c20-ad9e-acafb766ffdc.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
