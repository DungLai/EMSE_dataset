The API reference serves as a technical software reference. The user guide should serve as a scientific reference. In the user guide, we want to give an overview of sktime, including the \r\n* taxonomy of learning tasks, \r\n* how they are related and the concept of reduction, \r\n* sktime's package structure, \r\n* an overview of task-specific submodules (classification, forecasting, etc),\r\n* guidance/explanations of algorithms \r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\n* All user guide pages are in the `sktime/docs/source/user_guide/` folder, the overview page is `sktime/docs/source/user_guide.rst`\r\n* You can edit existing pages or create new ones and link them in the overview page\r\n* You can use restructured text (`.rst`) format or Jupyter notebooks\r\n\r\n## Contents \r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\"Introduction to SKTIME, motivation, structure, high-level how to use\"\r\n\r\n* assumption about users: basic understanding of scikit-learn/tabular setting\r\n* introductory example showing that there are multiple learning tasks in a time series context\r\n* \"there are many dedicated time series algorithms, you don't have to use deep learning to solve time series problems\"\r\n\r\n### Overview of time series learning tasks\r\n\r\n* task diagnosis (flow diagram): \"how to diagnose which task you are dealing with\" - include tasks that we currently do not support, see #210\r\n* reduction: how to adapt an algorithm for one task to solve another related task (diagram of reduction relations between learning tasks/algorithms)\r\n* three aspects of task specification: 1) generative setting, 2) learning, 3) evaluation\r\n\r\n### Time series transformations\r\n* many time series specific algorithms are compositions of prior transformations and tabular algorithms from scikit-learn\r\n* series-to-series, series-to-primitive \r\n* variations: fitted to single series or across independent instances\r\n* compositor: apply transforms locally (e.g. on interval) or globally over entire time series\r\n\r\n### Time series classification\r\n\"predicting a categorical target variable from time series\"\r\n* why do we distinguish between time series and tabular regression? \r\n* example (data generators)\r\n* specifying the task:\r\n    * assumed generative settings (data format: univariate, multivariate, panel data; statistical dependency structure)\r\n    * learning (input/output of algorithm type)\r\n    * evaluation\r\n* variations (univariate, multivariate, online learning)\r\n* algorithm taxonomy: see #355 \r\n    * dictionary-based \r\n    * frequency-based (e.g. RISE)\r\n    * interval-based (e.g. TSF)\r\n    * shapelet-based\r\n    * distance-based\r\n    * deep-learning\r\n* guidance on algorithm choice \r\n\r\n### Time series regression\r\n\"predicting a continuous target variables from time series\"\r\n* why do we distinguish between time series and tabular regression? \r\n* example\r\n* assumed generative settings (data format: univariate, multivariate, panel data; statistical dependency structure)\r\n* learning (input/output of algorithm type)\r\n* evaluation\r\n\r\n### Time series clustering\r\n\r\n### Forecasting\r\n\"temporal forward prediction\"\r\n* example\r\n* assumed generative settings (data format: univariate, multivariate, panel data; statistical dependency structure)\r\n* learning (input/output of algorithm type)\r\n* evaluation\r\n\r\n### Time series annotation\r\n\"annotating time points\"\r\ne.g. anomaly detection/outlier detection\r\n* example\r\n* assumed generative settings (data format: univariate, multivariate, panel data; statistical dependency structure)\r\n* learning (input/output of algorithm type)\r\n* evaluation\r\n\r\n## Useful resources\r\n* interesting blog post and PyCon presentation about how to structure documentation: https://documentation.divio.com\r\n* sphinx online editor: https://livesphinx.herokuapp.com\r\n* Jupyter books: https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/361/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
