Seems safest, but will be fiddly with the different mtypes, especially `numpy` based ones which do not have an index.\r\n* add a test scenario with `X` strictly larger to the test suite, and let individual estimators deal with this. Fix any bugs that this uncovers.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the best way is here.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3668/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
