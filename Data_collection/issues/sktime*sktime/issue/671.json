I propose adding an asymmetric error function too. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes, I also propose two changes to make Sktime's performance metrics more compatible with Scikit-learn:\r\n\r\n- Scikit-learn adapted many (all?) of its regression metrics to handle multioutput regression problems. I propose providing this functionality for each of the forecasting metrics in the above resources so that compatability with Scikit-learn's metrics is maintained and so that the functionality exists if future multivariate forecasting functionality is added. \r\n- Scikit-learn's metrics write out the full name (e.g. mean_absolute_error) and I propose updating Sktime's forecasting performance metrics to do the same\r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n- relative_error\r\n- mean_asymmetric_error\r\n- mean_absolute_scaled_error\r\n- median_absolute_scaled_error\r\n- root_mean_squared_scaled_error\r\n-  mean_absolute_error\r\n-  mean_squared_error\r\n-  root_mean_squared_error\r\n-  median_absolute_error\r\n-  median_squared_error\r\n-  root_median_squared_error\r\n-  symmetric_mean_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  symmetric_median_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  mean_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  median_absolute_percentage_error\r\n-  mean_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  median_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  root_mean_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  root_median_squared_percentage_error\r\n-  mean_relative_absolute_error\r\n-  median_relative_absolute_error\r\n-  geometric_mean_relative_absolute_error\r\n-  geometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n\r\nI've already started work on this and will start a draft pull request soon. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/671/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
