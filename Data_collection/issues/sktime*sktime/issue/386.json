[Link, but not a permalink](https://sktime.org/modules/auto_generated/sktime.forecasting.naive.NaiveForecaster.html#sktime.forecasting.naive.NaiveForecaster). The package version 0.4.1 does not support \"drift\", but fails with `ValueError: Unknown strategy: drift; expected one of ('last', 'mean', 'seasonal_last')`.\r\n\r\nI don't see a way to access the docs for older versions.\r\n\r\n#### My hypothesis\r\nI believe that\r\n1. docs are autobuilt and deployed from master on new changes\r\n    - See bullet 4 in #360: \"PRs into dev do not trigger doc builds, so changes to tutorial notebooks are not included in CI checks;\"\r\n2. master is often ahead of the latest release\r\n3. package version in master is only updated at release time\r\n     - see [the latest bump](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/commit/98ae0a1d9a3afcdcc0602a46f94a8e5aff292d28#diff-892e5b4461cd224a9f593fed8830d659)\r\n4. Consequently, the hosted docs are ahead of the latest release, while retaining the version number of the latest release. Some confusion may arise üòÅ \r\n\r\nSo when #383 enriched master with all the good stuff from dev, updated docs were built and deployed under the current version, and no package release was made.\r\n\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\n\r\nI sure don't know what would be the best(tm) way of handling this, but here's a few ideas for starters:\r\n\r\n1. Only build docs when also cutting a release (but this goes against the wish to have updated tutorial notebooks)\r\n2. Separate tutorial notebooks from the API docs so they can be built independently\r\n3. Differentiate among doc versions, so one could view either 0.4.1 or master/cutting edge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention.
