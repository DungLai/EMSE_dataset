This is because it's constructor violates scikit-learn API convention that an estimator should only set attributes to the values the user passes as arguments. `time_limit_in_mins * 60` is assigned to `self.time_limit`, which later on causes `clone` to fail.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_gunpoint\r\nfrom sktime.transformers.shapelets import ContractedShapeletTransform\r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble.forest import RandomForestClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\r\n\r\nX, y = load_gunpoint(split='TRAIN', return_X_y=True)\r\n\r\npipeline = Pipeline([\r\n    ('st', ContractedShapeletTransform(time_limit_in_mins=0.1,\r\n                                       num_candidates_to_sample_per_case=10,\r\n                                       verbose=2)),\r\n    ('rf', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)),\r\n])\r\n\r\npipeline.fit(X, y)\r\nscores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, cv = 2)\r\n\r\n# ...\r\n#   File \"C:\\Users\\rocke\\Documents\\python\\venvs\\sktime\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\base.py\", line 52, in <listcomp>\r\n#     return estimator_type([clone(e, safe=safe) for e in estimator])\r\n#   File \"C:\\Users\\rocke\\Documents\\python\\venvs\\sktime\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\base.py\", line 65, in clone\r\n#     new_object = klass(**new_object_params)\r\n#   File \"c:\\users\\rocke\\google drive\\universitaet\\data science\\sktime\\sktime\\transformers\\shapelets.py\", line 683, in __init__\r\n#     self.time_limit = time_limit_in_mins*60\r\n# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nRun cross validation without error.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nWindows-10-10.0.17763-SP0\r\nPython 3.7.4 (tags/v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 20:34:20) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nNumPy 1.17.2\r\nSciPy 1.2.2\r\nsktime 0.3.1\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"prockenschaub","id":15381732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgxNzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15381732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub","html_url":"https://github.com/prockenschaub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prockenschaub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
