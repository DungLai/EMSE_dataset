Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\n\r\nAutoregressive distributed lag models (ARDL) are a common time series model. and included in StatsModels We currently interface Statsmodel `AutoReg` which allows for coincident (X_t) exogenous data to be included. However, in many cases there could be a lag structure related to the relationship between the exogenous data and Y. ARDL models allow for this.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nUse our StatsModels adapter to implement an interface to StatsModels `ARDL` model and use StatsModels' `ardl_select_order` to provide an \"auto-ARDL\" option.\r\n\r\nBased on our previous approach to ARIMA models it looks likve we have separated out  classes for automated selection versus specifying specific models. In that case this would entail creating an ARDL forecaster class and an AutoARDL forecaster class. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nStatsModels [ARDL API Reference](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.ardl.ARDL.html) (which links to underlying code).\r\nStatsModels [ARDL notebook](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/autoregressive_distributed_lag.html) explaining ARDL model (could be useful when implementing and for documentation)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1432/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1432/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
