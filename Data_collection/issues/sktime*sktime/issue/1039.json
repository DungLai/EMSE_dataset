Issue is not resolved even if the label dtype is modified (to object, float, int, etc.) even though example seems to use str type for labels (see input [4] [here](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/examples/02_classification_univariate.html)).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSee code snippet below, with simulated data. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.utils.data_processing import from_2d_array_to_nested\r\nfrom sktime.classification.distance_based import KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier\r\n\r\n# simulate data as sinusoid for 1000 samples, add white noise\r\nt = np.linspace(0, 2*3.14, 2048)\r\nx = np.repeat(np.sin(t).reshape(-1, 1), 1000, axis=1).T\r\nx += np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=x.shape)\r\n\r\n# convert to sktime data rep\r\nX_train = from_2d_array_to_nested(x)\r\n\r\n# init and fit model\r\nclf = KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier()\r\ndummy_binary = np.array(np.random.choice([0, 1], X_train.shape[0]), dtype=str)\r\nclf.fit(X_train, dummy_binary)\r\n\r\n# eval\r\nclf.score(X_train, dummy_binary) # SLOW, does not complete computation\r\n# clf.predict(X_train) # same problem as above\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe classifier fits in ms, and I expect the scoring/predict methods to be fast as well.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTrying to do a multi-class classification problem with 1D time-series and ran into this bug while trying to get baselines using several classifiers from sktime. I thought it was an sklearn issue (perhaps related to [issue#10802](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/10802)); however, when interrupted, the `clf.score(...)` method is stuck inside some `sktime` script after calling `clf.predict`, e.g., see tiny error snippets below for the cBOSS classifier:\r\n```\r\nKeyboardInterrupt                         Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-258-f0a73361dd80> in <module>\r\n     15 dummy_binary = np.array(np.random.choice([0, 1], X_train.shape[0]), dtype=str)\r\n     16 clf.fit(X_train, dummy_binary)\r\n---> 17 clf.score(X_train, dummy_binary)\r\n     18 # clf.predict(X_train) # same problem as above\r\n\r\n~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sktime/classification/dictionary_based/_cboss.py in predict_proba(self, X)\r\n    254 \r\n    255         for n, clf in enumerate(self.classifiers):\r\n--> 256             preds = clf.predict(X)\r\n    257             for i in range(0, X.shape[0]):\r\n    258                 sums[i, self.class_dictionary[preds[i]]] += self.weights[n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.5 (default, Jul 28 2020, 12:59:40)  [GCC 9.3.0]\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\r\n   machine: Linux-4.4.0-18362-Microsoft-x86_64-with-glibc2.29\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 20.0.2\r\n   setuptools: 45.2.0\r\n      sklearn: 0.24.2\r\n       sktime: 0.6.1\r\n  statsmodels: 0.12.2\r\n        numpy: 1.20.3\r\n        scipy: 1.4.1\r\n       Cython: 0.29.23\r\n       pandas: 1.2.4\r\n   matplotlib: 3.2.1\r\n       joblib: 1.0.1\r\n        numba: 0.53.1\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
