Please describe.**\r\nRelated issues: #1032 #1505 https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/421\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI've sketched out a possible solution here: https://github.com/mloning/minimal-python-project-portable-pytest\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n* collect estimator tests in classes, one class for the `BaseEstimator` and one for each scitype \r\n* define test classes discoverable by pytest, inheriting from collection classes, possibly using multiple inheritance\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n* add `configure_get_estimators` so that it can be easily reused/configured in companion packages \r\n* rename `all_estimators` to `get_estimators` for readability\r\n* rename `estimator_instance` to `estimator_object` in line with common class/object distinction and avoiding ambiguity with \"instance\" as an i.i.d. data sample \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* If we use multiple inheritance for the class that collects the tests, we need to make sure that the parent classes have unique method names to avoid overriding methods\r\n* There still is a lot of duplication  in https://github.com/mloning/minimal-python-project-portable-pytest between the base package and companion package, especially regarding `configure_pytest_generate_tests` \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1524/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
