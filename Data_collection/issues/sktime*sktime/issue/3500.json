Please describe.**\r\nAdding DL Forecasters to sktime around the lines of how Classifiers and Regressor were migrated from sktime-dl. In this case, since there is no pre-existing code base for forecasters, we will have to create DL Forecasters roughly following the structure of other DL Estimators. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe solution would involve 2 major parts:\r\n1.`BaseDeepForecaster`: like `BaseDeepClassifer` and `BaseDeepRegressor`, the `BaseDeepForecaster` would derive from `BaseForecaster` and have functions specific to DL Forecasters (which will be its child classes)\r\n2. `FCNForecaster`: it would be the simplest forecaster to create since the network for it already exists (`FCNNetwork`) and it is the least complex forecaster\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSome good resources related to it which can be referred to:\r\n1.
