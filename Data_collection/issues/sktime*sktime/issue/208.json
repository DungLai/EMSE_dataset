Please describe.**\r\nMake code formatting consistent by using [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere are several formatting standards across the sktime codebase. This means we can't use automatic code formatters without making more changes than intended. `black` is a popular formatter that is used by an increasing number of projects including `pandas`. It enforces a strict subset of PEP8 standards easily and automatically.\r\n\r\nAs well as being a simple command-line tool, it can be integrated into several IDEs giving developers lots of flexibility. It can also be made into a git web hook or a unit test that will force contributors to make their code black-compliant to pass the regression tests ([here's an example](https://github.com/big-o/cherrypicker/blob/master/tests/test_black.py) from a side project of mine).","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
