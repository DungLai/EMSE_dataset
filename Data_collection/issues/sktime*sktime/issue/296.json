How to get started\r\nRead through our [how-to-get-started guide](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/How-to-get-started).\r\n\r\nIf you haven't done so already, watch our [online tutorial at PyData Amsterdam](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-tutorial-pydata-amsterdam-2020) to become familiar with sktime. Alternatively, work through our [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples). \r\n\r\nIf you get stuck or have a question, please comment on the relevant issue, chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/sktime/community) or the PyData discord server. \r\n\r\n## How to contribute \r\nRead our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).\r\n\r\nIt's always good to raise an issue or leave a comment on an existing issue before you start working to describe what you would like to change or implement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What to work on\r\nWe suggest a few topics to work on, but please don't hesitate to propose your own topic!\r\n\r\n### Beginner-friendly\r\n* üî¨ User testing: play around with the [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples), try to understand the code, and give us feedback! For example, which time series classifier achieves the best performance on the arrow head problem? Which forecaster achieves the best performance on the airline data set?\r\n* üìö Improve our [online documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/api_reference.html) - many classes and methods have missing doc strings!\r\n* üìñ Improve our [example notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples) - make them more engaging and instructive.\r\n\r\n### Intermediate \r\n* ‚öôÔ∏è Take a look at our [good-first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue) and pick one that interests you. \r\n* üöß Improve our dev ops, see #241 (dev ops skills)\r\n* üíª Enhance our [website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime) (web development skills)\r\n\r\n### Advanced\r\n* üß∞ Create interfaces to other toolboxes like [gluon-ts](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts) or [fbprophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)\r\n* üé® Pick a topic from our [development roadmap](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/228) and propose an API design - for examples, see our design notes on [forecasting](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Forecasting-API-proposal) and [annotation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Time-series-annotation-API-proposal)\r\n* üêº Data container, check out our [introductory notebook](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-tutorial-pydata-amsterdam-2020/blob/master/notebooks/data_container.ipynb) and [design discussion](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Time-series-data-container)\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Follow-up projects\r\nOur goal, apart from improving sktime, is to onboard new contributors and we would really like you to stay around after the sprint. We're actively looking for new contributors and your help is extremely welcome!\r\n\r\n### What we offer\r\nWe have an active community of researchers and students who work on sktime, and we offer an informal mentorship programme over the summer in which we help you become more familiar with machine learning, time series analysis and open-source software development. The programme would involve weekly calls with your mentor. \r\n\r\n### What we expect \r\nYou can choose a project to work on and we can help you to find an interesting topic. In addition to the individual project work, all students will be expected to:\r\n* peer-review fellow contributors' work,\r\n* write a blog post about your contribution,\r\n* socialise with other students and contributors. \r\n\r\nPlease get in touch if you're interested!","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
