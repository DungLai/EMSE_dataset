to keep track of a few questions regarding the implementation of rotation forest:\r\n* What do you do if the number of instances is smaller than the number of columns after subsetting, given that the number of components in PCA is `min(n_instances, n_columns)`? Add zeros?\r\n* In the original paper, they resample instances with replacement (bootstrapped) as far as I understand, why do we sample without replacements?\r\n\r\nCurrent versions are here:\r\n* [Tony](https://github.com/TonyBagnall/py-hive-cote/blob/master/classifiers/time_domain_classification/RotationForestLastTony.py)\r\n* [Markus](https://github.com/mloning/rotation_forest/blob/master/rotation_forest/rotation_forest.py), older version [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/rotf/sktime/contrib/rotation_forest/rotation_forest_reworked.py)\r\n* [UEA implementation in Java](https://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/blob/master/src/main/java/weka/classifiers/meta/RotationForest.java)\r\n* [original implementation in Java](https://github.com/Waikato/weka-trunk/blob/master/packages/external/rotationForest/src/main/java/weka/classifiers/meta/RotationForest.java)","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
