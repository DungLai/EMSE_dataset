Description\r\nFLOSS is a “semantic segmentation” algorithm compatible with online data (streaming data, sliding window).\r\nThe algorithm divides a time series into internally consistent homogenous regions called regimes.\r\n\r\nFLOSS produces a time series called the One Direction Corrected Arc Curve ($CAC_{1D}$) for each window sliding over a given raw time series. $CAC_{1D}$ annotates the raw time series with information about the likelihood of a regime change at each location.\r\n\r\n**FLOSS’s advantages** \r\n\r\n- _Domain Agnosticism_ \r\nFLOSS is a domain agnostic technique that makes no assumptions about the data. \r\n- _Real-World Data Suitability_\r\nMany techniques assume that every data region belongs to a well-defined semantic segment. However, lack of structure in accumulated data is common. FLOSS can effectively mark these difficult sections as “don’t know”.\r\n- _Streaming_\r\nOnline segmentation of data may provide actionable real-time information. \r\n\r\nFor more information about FLOSS, see - \r\nhttps://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Segmentation_ICDM.pdf\r\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/part-4-semantic-segmentation-b42c3792833d\r\n\r\n### Feature Request\r\nImplementation of FLOSS\r\n\r\n### Suggestion and considerations\r\nI have looked into [stumpy](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [matrixprofile](https://matrixprofile.docs.matrixprofile.org/index.html) packages for Matrix Profile and FLOSS interfacing. This is the summary of my findings:\r\n\r\n_Interfacing `stumpy`_ \r\nStumpy is a well-maintained and documented Python library with a univariate-data implementation of FLOSS. \r\n[`stumpy.floss`](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#floss) receive two series as input - the raw input time-series data and the output of the Matrix Profile algorithm. \r\nStumpy has implemented both univariate-data and multivariate-data Matrix Profile ([stump](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#stump) and [mstump](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#mstump), respectively), but it looks like `floss` is only compatible with univariate data.\r\n[Matrix Profile](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial_The_Matrix_Profile.html), [Multi-dimensional Matrix Profile](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial_Multidimensional_Motif_Discovery.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interfacing `matrixprofile` (MPF)_\r\nMatrixprofile is a well-documented Python library with a univariate-data implementation of Matrix Profile and other methods. Unfortunately, there is no concrete implementation of FLOSS, to my understanding.\r\n[Matrix Profile - mpx](https://matrixprofile.docs.matrixprofile.org/api.html#matrixprofile-algorithms-mpx), [Matrix Profile - stomp](https://matrixprofile.docs.matrixprofile.org/api.html#matrixprofile-algorithms-stomp), [Regimes](https://matrixprofile.docs.matrixprofile.org/api.html#matrixprofile-discover-regimes)\r\n\r\n_Suggestion_\r\nCreating a multivariate version of FLOSS will be more challenging than planned. \r\nI consider interfacing the univariate implementation of `stumpy`  to begin with and later moving on to interfacing or implementing a multivariate version of FLOSS (if such a version has been studied). \r\n\r\n_Tasks_\r\n- [ ] Interfacing the univariate implementation of `stumpy` FLOSS.\r\n- [ ] Interfacing or implementing a multivariate version of FLOSS\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
