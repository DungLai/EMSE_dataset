`ColumnForecaster` takes a list of forecasters which are applied to columns.\r\nThis causes some interaction with the tests, since whether it's univariate/multivariate depends on the `forecasters`.\r\n\r\nWhat it should be able to do is take a single forecaster (as an alternative to multiple `forecasters`), which is then by default cloned and applied to all columns, irrespective of number of columns in `y`.\r\n\r\nThat is, at the start of `_fit` we would see how many columns `y` have, and then create the clones similar to how we do it with the forecasters in `forecasters`, just of the single forecaster that is passed.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1325/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
