This is counterintuitive, and confusing, especially since the same lags are applied to both.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic, since there is no way to apply *no* lags to `X` and *some* lags to `y`.\r\n\r\nIt is also redundant, as the reducers can be pipelined with `Lag`, which would apply the lags to `X`.\r\n\r\nThe lagging in `X` should hence be removed.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
