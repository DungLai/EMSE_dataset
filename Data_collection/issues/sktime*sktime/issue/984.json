If a list is passed, we need to think about the return object - perhaps a data frame, with nested column index if we are in the multivariate case? Or, we could annotate columns `[variablename]__[statistic]`, e.g., `temperature__P95` using the reserved double-underscore.\r\n* `predict_var`, this should return predictive variance (not quantiles) - note that that's what comes out Gaussian process type regressors primarily.\r\n* `predict_proba`, this returns a `skpro`-like distribution object. May requires work on `skpro`, or could use `tensorflow-probability` distributions.\r\n\r\nFor the first two, we could alternatively think about return flags and return objects in `predict`, but that just seems very messy to me.\r\n\r\nAny opinions? @aiwalter, @mloning, @RNKuhns ","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/984/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/984/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
