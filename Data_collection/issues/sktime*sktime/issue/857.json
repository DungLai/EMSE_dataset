Please describe.**\r\nThe `sktime.forecasting.model_evaluation.evaluate` function does not work with the MASE.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nProvide the MASE() object as the `scoring` parameter. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe current problem is that `evaluate` only accepts metrics that calculate a score from `y_test` and `y_pred`. The MASE however also needs `y_train`. As `y_train` is available within `evaluate` this shouldn't take too much time.","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/857/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
