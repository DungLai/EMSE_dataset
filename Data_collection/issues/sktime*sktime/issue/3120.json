The testing framework has all interface compliance tests needed for that, so could be adapted in-principle.\r\n\r\nExample bug that was not detected due to this: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/3119\r\n\r\nAffected objects:\r\n* splitters, `BaseSplitter` descendants\r\n* performance metrics, `BaseMetric` descendants\r\n* rarely used objects present in the codebase like `BaseTask`\r\n\r\nThe key problem that needs to be addressed is that currently the test framework assumes inheritance from `BaseEstimator`, and therefore presence of `fit` and associated interface assumptions.\r\n\r\nChanges that would need to be made:\r\n* split `TestAllEstimators` into a part for objects and a part for estimators. Also relates to work on https://github.com/sktime/BaseObject where this splitting is currently ongoing. There should be a `TestAllObjects`, and, separately, `TestAllEstimators`.\r\n* add base classes to the base class registry in `registry._base_classes`, including `BaseObject` as a base class that is not there yet\r\n* optionally, add additional tests that are specific to the more specific base classes like `BaseSplitter`, `BaseMetric`. Existing tests should be moved into the test class\r\n* ensure the newly tested classes are interface compliant, by fixing any bugs similar to #3119 that the upgraded testing framework discovers","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
