following the Development version installation steps, they would have to incorporate the steps of the \"Git and GitHub workflow\" to be able to contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether it is necessary to have \"Development versions\" installation steps and separate installation steps in the \"Git and GitHub workflow\" section. \r\n\r\nIf the answer is no, a possible solution would be to direct the reader to the \"Git and GitHub workflow\" from the \"Development versions\" installation using a link.\r\n\r\nIf the answer is yes, it would be advisable to make it clearer for a new
