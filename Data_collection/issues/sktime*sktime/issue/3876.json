by @fkiraly:\r\n\r\n@patrickzib kept changing the original post constantly.\r\n\r\nThe most informative version was a link to this issue https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3567\r\n\r\nwhich had a broder explanation of minimizing dependencies, references to literature such as sklearn etc.\r\n\r\nThis got deleted, so readers of this thread who want context may like to look at the first post in #3567 and replace `numba` with \"any current dependency\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncurrent state of the first post after multiple self-edits by @patrickzib:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think it is best to aggregate the discussion into this topic and have a general discussion on dependency minimization in sktime and how this should be acchieved.\r\n\r\n- Numba: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3567\r\n- Scipy: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3875\r\n- Sklearn: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3874\r\n- Pandas: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3873\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nI will use `X` as a placeholder for the hard dependency libraries currently used in scikit-time, with $X \\in \\{scipy, numba, sklearn, statemodel, pandas\\}$\r\n\r\n@fkiraly is a strong advocate of soft dependencies. Arguments following the argumentation line of @fkiraly: \r\n\r\n> I think we should turn `X` into a soft dependency, since it is not core to the framework, but used only in specific estimators.\r\n\r\nSee above issues for his precise argumentation line.\r\n\r\n<hr> \r\n\r\n**I @patrickzib believe we should have a broader discussion. The whole discussion is centered around soft-dependencies and numba. Instead, we should discuss dependeny minimization in general, including not only** \r\n- soft dependencies \r\n- but also submodules \r\n- or removing libraries\r\n- or any other valid concept","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3876/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
