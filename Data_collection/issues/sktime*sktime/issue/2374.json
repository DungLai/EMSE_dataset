The mix-up was not detected since `SignatureTransformer` still would produce a table output, just not the one which the intention to produce was.\r\n\r\nFYI @jambo6, @TonyBagnall.\r\n\r\nI think this is fixed in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2369, although it means that the `depth` parameters chosen are no longer compatible and raise errors, and the \"expected results\" are also no longer right.\r\n\r\nHow do we go about this?\r\nPerhaps we should confirm first whether I am right, @jambo6, @TonyBagnall?","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2374/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
