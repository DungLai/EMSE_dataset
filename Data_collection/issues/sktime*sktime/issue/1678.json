Default parameters would no longer have to be entered in _config but become part of the list of things to implement, in the extension template.\r\n\r\n### Related Issue\r\n#1098 \r\n\r\n### Step\r\n[link for step](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/12_estimator_test_instances/step.md)\r\nThis issue is associated with point 3 of the **suggested refactor sequence** given in the above step.\r\n\r\n### Contributing Guidelines\r\nIf you would like to work on this: please post here and which estimator you are taking on, to avoid duplication of work.\r\nA core dev will then add your name to the estimator under refactoring and/or link the PR.\r\n\r\nA general recipe for refactoring is as follows:\r\n- pick up an estimator class from the below checklist of estimators.\r\n- look for parameters of the estimator in `ESTIMATOR_TEST_PARAMS` (in the tests._config file)\r\n- add `get_test_params` method to the corresponding estimator class which returns a dictionary of the above parameters \r\n- refer to [extension template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/main/extension_templates) to add get_test_params to the corresponding estimator class\r\n- For example, in case of `ColumnEnsembleForecaster` , dictionary of parameters which is `{\"forecasters\": FORECASTER} `, should be returned from `get_test_params` method. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChecklist of estimators:\r\n\r\n- [x] ColumnEnsembleForecaster\r\n- [x] OnlineEnsembleForecaster\r\n- [x] FeatureUnion\r\n- [x] DirectTabularRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] MultioutputTabularRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] RecursiveTabularRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] DirRecTabularRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] DirectTimeSeriesRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] RecursiveTimeSeriesRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] MultioutputTimeSeriesRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] DirRecTimeSeriesRegressionForecaster\r\n- [x] TransformedTargetForecaster\r\n- [x] ForecastingPipeline\r\n- [x] EnsembleForecaster\r\n- [x] StackingForecaster\r\n- [x] AutoEnsembleForecaster\r\n- [x] Detrender\r\n- [x] ForecastingGridSearchCV\r\n- [x] ForecastingRandomizedSearchCV\r\n- [x] TabularToSeriesAdaptor\r\n- [x] ColumnEnsembleClassifier\r\n- [x] FittedParamExtractor\r\n- [x] SeriesToPrimitivesRowTransformer\r\n- [x] SeriesToSeriesRowTransformer\r\n- [x] ColumnTransformer\r\n- [x] AutoARIMA\r\n- [x] MultiplexForecaster\r\n- [x] ShapeletTransformClassifier\r\n- [x] ContractedShapeletTransform\r\n- [x] ShapeletTransform\r\n- [x] SignatureTransformer\r\n- [x] SignatureClassifier\r\n- [x] Catch22Classifier\r\n- [x] MatrixProfileClassifier\r\n- [x] TSFreshClassifier\r\n- [x] ROCKETClassifier\r\n- [x] Arsenal\r\n- [x] HIVECOTEV1\r\n- [x] TSFreshFeatureExtractor\r\n- [x] TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor\r\n- [x] TSInterpolator\r\n- [x] RandomIntervalSpectralForest\r\n- [x] SFA\r\n- [x] ContractableBOSS\r\n- [x] TemporalDictionaryEnsemble\r\n- [x] TimeSeriesForestClassifier\r\n- [x] ComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier\r\n- [x] ComposableTimeSeriesForestRegressor\r\n- [x] SupervisedTimeSeriesForest\r\n- [x] CanonicalIntervalForest\r\n- [x] DrCIF\r\n- [x] HCrystalBallForecaster\r\n- [x] BATS\r\n- [x] TBATS\r\n- [x] Prophet\r\n- [x] UnobservedComponents\r\n- [x] PartialAutoCorrelationTransformer\r\n- [x] AutoCorrelationTransformer\r\n- [x] Imputer\r\n- [x] HampelFilter\r\n- [x] OptionalPassthrough\r\n- [x] FeatureSelection\r\n- [x] ColumnwiseTransformer\r\n- [x] AggrDist\r\n- [x] PyODAnnotator\r\n- [x] ClaSPSegmentation","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
