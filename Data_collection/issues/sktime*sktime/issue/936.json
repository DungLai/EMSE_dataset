For example, if a maximum interval for RISE is set longer than the actual series, this is only detected in fit(X). Some of these type of cases are handled, some are not. If you want to work on this, pick a classifier, raise an issue related to this and we can comment. It would be useful to road test the classifier of choice with edge cases to see what happens, and whether it is clear what went wrong when it crashes.
