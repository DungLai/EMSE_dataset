Please describe.**\r\nSimilar to sklearn's model_selection.Kfold() class, I want to be able to easily get the temporal folds out of the window splitters.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import CutoffSplitter\r\ncv = CutoffSplitter([5, 10, 15])\r\nfor train, test in cv.split(data):\r\n     # fit model on train data\r\n     # evaluate model on test data\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis function in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/window_splitters.ipynb.
