The slicing behaviour appears to be inclusive for start and end for series so there is one element that is in both.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nindex = pd.date_range(datetime(2022, 5, 1, 9), datetime(2022, 5, 2, 8), freq=\"H\")\r\n\r\ny = pd.Series(index=index, data=[1]*len(index))\r\n\r\ny_index = y.index\r\n\r\nfor id in y_index:\r\n  y_train = y[:id]\r\n  print(y_train)\r\n  y_test = y[id:]\r\n  print(y_test)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTrain and test sets should be exclusive. This can be achieved with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ny_train = y[:id][:-1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.12 (default, Oct 22 2021, 18:39:35)  [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)]\r\nexecutable: /Users/..../python\r\n   machine: macOS-12.1-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.0.3\r\n   setuptools: 60.6.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.2\r\n       sktime: 0.11.3\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.21.5\r\n        scipy: 1.7.3\r\n       pandas: 1.4.1\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.1\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.1\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: 0.19.0","closed_by":{"login":"bethrice44","id":11226988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI2OTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11226988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44","html_url":"https://github.com/bethrice44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bethrice44/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2702/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
