Currently, sktime module supports lagged time series component (window_length) which is specified in make_reduction method. It would be of great value, if this method supports moving average smoothing (backward rolling window) for target time series. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternative solution is to use ARIMA, because it supports both Auto Regressive component (lags) and Moving Average component (Smoothing). But it is not as good as GBT algorithm.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI understand that tsfresh provides tools to extract features but this process takes a lot more time to compute the features.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
