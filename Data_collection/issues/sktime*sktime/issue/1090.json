Please describe.**\r\n`TransformedTargetForecaster` inherits from `_SeriesToSeriesTransformer` and should therefore also be able to just receive transformers only in `steps`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCatching cases when last step of `steps` is not a forecaster. This would have to rise an exception when `predict()` is called as a transformer only has `fit()` and `transform()`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAfter having a multivariate interface where `y` can also be a `pd.DataFrame`, we can do the same for the new `ForecastingPipeline` (this would also inherit then from `_SeriesToSeriesTransformer`).
