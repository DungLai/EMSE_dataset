There are some nuances that I have noticed:\r\n\r\n1. There is absolutely no difference between using `SlidingWindowSplitter` and `ExpandingWindowSplitter` when pass them to `ForecastingGridSearchCV`. New data is appended to `self._y` and `self._X` according to the selected splitter strategy (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/552#issuecomment-748685565, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/520#issuecomment-737325145), but: \r\n    - Training folds are still the same for both splitters.\r\n    - Training folds become larger and larger. It's OK for `ExpandingWindowSplitter`, but not for `SlidingWindowSplitter`. For `SlidingWindowSplitter`'s training folds should have the same length and move forward step by step and forget the earliest data points.\r\n\r\n2. I believe that `initial_window` and `start_with_window` parameters can be avoided in splitter classes to make them easier to understand (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/521, https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/518). For example, I suggest the following signatures:\r\n    - `SlidingWindowSplitter(window_length, fh, step_length)`: fixed size training windows\r\n    - `ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_window_length, fh, step_length)`: expanding training windows\r\n\r\n    As you can see I was inspired by `pmdarima.model_selection`'s classes `SlidingWindowForecastCV` and `RollingForecastCV`.\r\n\r\n3. `ForecastingGridSearchCV` doesn't support a multi-step forecasting horizon (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/633).\r\n\r\n4. Also, it's good to add `cross_val_score` function in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection` that returns scores for each train/test folds. I found @aiwalter's evaluate function very similar to what I mean (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/657).\r\n\r\n5. The final suggestion is about update vs refit trade-off.\r\n    - For sliding window setting when the training fold has a fixed length there is only one option - call refit.\r\n    - For expanding window setting, from my point of view, the better approach is to use update functionality and refit as a fall-back option.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any of my suggestions sound interesting to you.
