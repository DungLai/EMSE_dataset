Simply switch upper/lower perhaps?\r\n\r\nTo reproduce: run `test_predict_pred_interval` with parameters `0.05`, `fh1`, `Prophet`.\r\nRepeat 5-10 times to see one failure (on average, stochastic, rule of thumb frequency).\r\n\r\nFYI @kejsitake.\r\n\r\nFrom discussion with @kejsitake who pointed out the likely reason:\r\n`Prophet` outputs are MC sampled, and upper may be sampled independently from lower (not a good idea?), hence If a small coverage is requested (such as the 5% in the test), the sampling variance may cause upper to be smaller than lower.\r\nLikely an issue with the dependency `prophet`.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
