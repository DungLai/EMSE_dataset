are a number of issues open for forecasting reducers (from forecasting to supervised regression and TSR), we should refactor and upgrade them.\r\n\r\nAll reducers (descendants of `_Reducer`) should support:\r\n\r\n* multivariate `y`, if the wrapped supervised regressor or TSR supports this.\r\n* exogeneous `X`, the direct reduers currently do not support this https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2464\r\n* custom transformers passed via the `transformers` argument.\r\n* native support for hierarchical data\r\n\r\nWe should also add tests
