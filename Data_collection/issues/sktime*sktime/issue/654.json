Note this only affects the python implementations of these distances - the cython versions do not have this error.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nRun either WDDTW or DDTW with two numpy multidimensional time series arrays (i.e. two 3d arrays).\r\n\r\n`derivative_dtw_distance(np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]), np.array([[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]))`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe diff usage (iirc) is incorrect for computing the derivative anyway. We should change this to compute the derivative properly.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
