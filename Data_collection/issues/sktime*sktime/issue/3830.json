For statsmodels models with exogenous features X_test length must equal the forecast horizon and therefore this currently throws the error:\r\n\r\n`ValueError: Provided exogenous values are not of the appropriate shape.`\r\n\r\nThis bug occurs for UnobservedComponents and SARIMAX.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the bug is in the `_split` function:\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/a5f824a5fff1c3fc1babd3f34b94c5055ec040b0/sktime/forecasting/model_evaluation/_functions.py#L60\r\n\r\nThis could be modified to 'X.iloc[test].sort_index()' for statsmodels models with exogenous features or alternatively by filtering X here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/a5f824a5fff1c3fc1babd3f34b94c5055ec040b0/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_statsmodels.py#L104\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.structural import UnobservedComponents\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_evaluation import evaluate\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import SlidingWindowSplitter\r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\n\r\nforecaster = UnobservedComponents(level='local linear trend')\r\n\r\ncv = SlidingWindowSplitter(fh=[1,2,3],\r\n                           window_length = 4,\r\n                           step_length = 1)\r\n\r\nresults = evaluate(\r\n        forecaster=forecaster, y=y, X = X,\r\n        cv=cv, strategy='refit', return_data=True,\r\n        error_score = 'raise'\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\npython: 3.8.12 (default, Nov 20 2022, 10:50:06)  [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)]\r\nmachine: macOS-13.0.1-arm64-arm-64bit\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 21.2\r\n   setuptools: 63.1.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.1.3\r\n       sktime: 0.14.0\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.5\r\n        numpy: 1.22.0\r\n        scipy: 1.9.3\r\n       pandas: 1.4.1\r\n   matplotlib: 3.6.2\r\n       joblib: 1.2.0\r\n        numba: 0.56.4\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
