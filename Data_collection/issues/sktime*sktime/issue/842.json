Please describe.**\r\nI'm new to sktime and time series classification.\r\nI have installed sktime toolkit. I trying to apply HIVE-COTE 1.0 to my dataset. The codes are shown as follows, x_train, y_train, x_test, and y_test are my prepared dataset. I call HIVE-COTE directly through the module HIVECOTEV1, but I am not sure if this is the correct way to reproduce hive-cote algorithm. Is this HIVECOTE1 module includes ensembling part (like TimeseriesForestClassifier)? \r\n![Outlook-1gckqx1b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76831540/116163395-0690e400-a73b-11eb-8718-25dbdf88c2a9.png)\r\n\r\nAnother question is the time series dataset I have is 3d array, which is in the format of (number of samples, time steps, number of features). But when I fed the dataset into the Timeserisforestclassifier, the error information is shown as follows. After processing the dataset with the module 'columnconcatenator()', it can run smoothly. Does that mean only 2d array can be fed into the algorithm as well as HIVE-COTE? \r\nThe shape of x_train, y_train, x_test, and y_test: (28, 1918, 62) (16, 1918, 62) (28,) (16,)\r\nerror information:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"h:/scipt/prediction/stacking for classification/HIVECOTE.py\", line 73, in <module>\r\n    clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\r\n  File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\envs\\lib\\site-packages\\sktime\\series_as_features\\base\\estimators\\interval_based\\_tsf.py\", line 86, in fit\r\n    coerce_to_numpy=True,\r\n  File \"C:\\envs\\ARTC\\lib\\site-packages\\sktime\\utils\\validation\\panel.py\", line 187, in check_X_y\r\n    coerce_to_pandas=coerce_to_pandas,\r\n  File \"C:\\Anaconda3\\envs\\lib\\site-packages\\sktime\\utils\\validation\\panel.py\", line 87, in check_X\r\n    f\"X must be univariate with X.shape[1] == 1, but found: \"\r\nValueError: X must be univariate with X.shape[1] == 1, but found: X.shape[1] == 1918.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt will be very appreciated that if you can provide a demo of Multivariate time series classification with HIVECOTE in python on Github or sktime documentation.
