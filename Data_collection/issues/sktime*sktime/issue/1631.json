I think the problem is that fbprophet is quite old and they list pystan>=2.14 as a requirement. This causes pystan 3.2.0 to be installed which is actually not compatible with prophet! Prophet only supports pystan 2. prophet has the correct pin of pystan~=2.19.1.1.\r\n\r\nYou can repro this like follow:\r\n- Download the fbprophet tar ball [here](https://pypi.org/project/fbprophet/#files)\r\n- Open `requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nYou should see the following:\r\n```\r\nCython>=0.22\r\ncmdstanpy==0.9.5\r\npystan>=2.14\r\nnumpy>=1.15.4\r\npandas>=1.0.4\r\nmatplotlib>=2.0.0\r\nLunarCalendar>=0.0.9\r\nconvertdate>=2.1.2\r\nholidays>=0.10.2\r\nsetuptools-git>=1.2\r\npython-dateutil>=2.8.0\r\ntqdm>=4.36.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n`pystan>=2.14` will install the latest pystan ([pystan 3](https://pypi.org/project/pystan/)). However, Prophet does not support [pystan 3](https://github.com/facebook/prophet#installation-in-python)!!\r\n\r\nI suspect this is making our build more complicated than it needs to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
