That is, tinkering around with the set of component classifiers, and the mixture weights, until it had - by randomness! - achieved good performance on the UCI dataset collection. Even when restricting the number of classifiers to choose from to 10 or so, and the weight combinations to as few as 5, we still face a combinatorial explosion which could plausibly explain supposed outperformance as random.\r\n\r\nI think we should just remove this estimator from `sktime`.\r\n\r\nOther problematic aspects:\r\n* the ensemble method is not available as a compositor in `sktime`, and neither weight choice nor choice of components are explorable parameters. Therefore, the authors do not give others an easy way to construct similar estimators, or explore how much impact there could be of the above kind of cherry-picking.\r\n* the authors of the paper claim the results are easily reproducible, but despite there being a benchmarking module in `sktime`, and the estimator being available in `sktime`, there is no code available for simply re-running the experiment. That is odd.\r\n* in the reference paper, a lot of tests are performed (implicitly in the critical difference diagrams), but - probably - no multiple testing correction is carried out. This approach favours type I errors, i.e., mistakenly finding outperformance by the new estimator where it is not real.\r\n* the experiment in the paper does not compare to naive baselines, or simple baselines such as much simpler pipelines as [feature extractor][supervised classifier], e.g., binner & random forest. For fairness, similar size combinatorial spaces should be explored of this combination.\r\n\r\nPaper reference HIVE-COTE2: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07551\r\n\r\nPaper with a discussion on why comparison to simpler baselines is important: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07519","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3034/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":5,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
