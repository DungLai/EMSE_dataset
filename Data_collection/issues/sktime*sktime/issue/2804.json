Please describe.**\r\nReference Issue #2777\r\nKotsu is a high level and light-weight package that performs benchmarking that has no dependency on specific packages. At a high level, it allows users to register a dataset with a validation task (CV splitter method) and then apply estimators to that registration. It will be beneficial to investigate its application to sktime's benchmarking.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nInput: estimator, dataset, cross validation splitter\r\nOutput: a Dataframe showing result per estimator per dataset\r\n*: In this notebook, the result is returned as a .csv saved to the same folder as the notebook\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
