(note, checking for identity alignment is not sound. I think one option would be to create a mock object for the dtw package we wrap)\r\n3. (maybe). have more detailed documentation for `_fit` in dtw wrapper classes, beyond 'core logic of fit'. this suggest is intended as develoepr documentation rather than end-user documentation.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1634/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
