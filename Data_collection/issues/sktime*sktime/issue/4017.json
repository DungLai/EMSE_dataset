I looked [here](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/developer_guide/documentation.html) to find out how I could remedy this. I found it difficult to understand where indents, spaces, and newlines were required. I initially looked at examples in the link to [NumPy docstring format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).  However, I was looking for an example where there is a list in the parameters section and could not find this. @aiwalter kindly re-directed me to the [`Imputer`](https://www.sktime.org/en/v0.15.0/api_reference/auto_generated/sktime.transformations.series.impute.Imputer.html) documentation. \r\n\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\n\r\nAdd more canonical examples which cover a wider range of scenarios (e.g., a list of types in the parameters section). \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4017/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
