Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there is no data loader for M5 dataset. Addition of this dataset will help greatly enhance our bench marking ability. The M5 dataset gives historical sales data and asked users to predict sales for two 28-day time periods. The dataset contains the following files:\r\n* calendar.csv - Contains information about the dates on which the products are sold.\r\n* sales_train_validation.csv - Contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store [d_1 - d_1913]\r\n* sample_submission.csv - The correct format for submissions.\r\n* sell_prices.csv - Contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date.\r\n* sales_train_evaluation.csv - Includes sales [d_1 - d_1941] (labels used for the Public leaderboard)\r\n\r\nOriginal data can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA dataset loader for M5 dataset. It'll work as follows:\r\n`load_M5()`\r\nThe result will be (a) Dataframe(s) in memory or a Callable that fetches data as the forecasting goes on.
