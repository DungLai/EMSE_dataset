Please describe.**\r\nMany forecasters require exogenous data for the forecasting horizon when generating predictions, however some models can make use of information across multiple series in training without requiring other series in prediction. \r\n\r\nThis is sometimes called \"cross-learning\", e.g. search for \"cross-learning\" in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03854.pdf. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need to distinguish between the two types of forecasting and add support for cross-learning forecasters.
