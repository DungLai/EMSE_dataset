Might be able to make use of some of the `GridSearch` functionality that already exists in sktime? (though we might need to configure it so it makes sense for evaluating how well an annotation estimator is performing?) \r\n- *potentially* we could also consider supporting some probability distribution over the number of segments returned (for example, could be modeled as a dirichlet process or something? \r\n        - this might also look like a pre-preprocessing step, but then we could imagine calculating an expectation value using our estimators instead of a MLE estimate?\r\n        \r\nAnyway - wanted to loop you all in to the discussion so you could also share any ideas or concerns you might have about this? \r\n\r\n@KatieBuc @fkiraly @lmmentel @NoaBenAmi @lielleravid @Lovkush-A  (please `@` anyone I may have forgotten who would also be interested)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
