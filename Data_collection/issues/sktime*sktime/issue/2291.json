It seems like the property class `_y` attribute gets updated with the new observations, but the model is not refitted, and predictions returned are just longer forecasts of the originally trained model.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.11 (default, Jan 25 2022, 23:19:55)  [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)]\r\nexecutable: /Users/tsangis/Projects/uk-ds-day-ahead-prices-forecast/venv/bin/python\r\n   machine: macOS-12.0.1-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.0.3\r\n   setuptools: 58.0.4\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.2\r\n       sktime: 0.10.1\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.1\r\n        numpy: 1.21.1\r\n        scipy: 1.7.3\r\n       pandas: 1.4.1\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.1\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.1\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.4\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
