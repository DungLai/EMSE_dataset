The following are some tasks which can be completed to solve these issues and improve the estimators:\r\n\r\n- [x] Verify current handling of unequal length data for both estimators. Fix any issues that arise, the current internal datatype is nested univariate dataframes, which can handle unequal length datasets (397).\r\n- [x] Verify if the 1289 RuntimeError still happens outside a main method. Perhaps add a warning to docs if it does, not much to fix with this one pretty sure.\r\n- [x] Verify if 1478 and 1484 are still issues, try relaxing `statsmodels` upper bound.\r\n- [x] Verify if 2637 still relevant to TSFresh specifically.\r\n- [x] Try to reproduce the `impute_function` bug reported in 1824, fix if it can be reproduced else close. \r\n- [x] Write docstring for `TSFreshFeatureExtractor` (2073 and 3526).\r\n- [x] Write docstring for `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor` (2073 and 3526).\r\n- [x] Verify that a parameter that allows the user to specify the features they would like to extract exists and is functioning (3526).\r\n- [x] Clearer parameters for both estimators (3526).\r\n- [x] Implement `get_test_params` methods for `TSFreshFeatureExtractor` (3526).\r\n- [x] Implement `get_test_params` methods for `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor` (3526).\r\n- [x] Add `fit_transform` method to `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor`","closed_by":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3658/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
