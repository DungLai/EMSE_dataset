From issue #1142:\r\n\r\n>it's impossible to install all dependencies via conda:\r\n>- `pmdarima` causes version conflicts, you can see the conda output in the failed ci runs of the first commits.\r\n>- Even if `pmdarima` did not cause conflicts, it's not available on windows\r\n>- tbats and catch-22 do not have a package on conda forge\r\n\r\n>I filed an issue for `tbats` to create a `conda` package here: https://github.com/intive-DataScience/tbats/issues/29 . Once that's done, I don't expect any problems adding tbats to the conda recipe.\r\n>\r\n>If `catch-22` will be removed sometime in the future, I think that just leaves `pmdarima`. We would need to figure out what's causing the version conflicts during the build and that could take some time. We can also file an issue for `catch-22` to create a conda package but I leave it up to your judgment since you have a better understanding of the timeline for deprecating its use. \r\n\r\n>So in short:\r\n\r\n- [x] adding `tbats` to the recipe once they create a package. \r\n- [ ] adding `pmdarima` to the `conda` recipe after resolving the above issues.\r\n- [ ] resolve `catch-22` situation - deprecate, move out, or help move to `conda`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
