When I try to run it this way, however, the training process seems to complete fine, but at inference time I get a ValueError from numpy saying that it cannot broadcast size (N,1) to (N,). For example, when I try to predict on a set with 8 possible classes (with the classes for each sample represented as a multi-hot vector) I get an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# these sets have shapes (22317, 4)  (7440, 4) (22317, 8)  (7440, 8)\r\nX_tr, X_ts, y_tr, y_ts = train_test_split(data, labels)\r\n\r\npipe = Pipeline([\r\n    ('concat', ColumnConcatenator()),\r\n    ('classify', TimeSeriesForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, n_jobs=n_jobs))\r\n    ])\r\npipe.fit(X_tr, y_tr.values)\r\nresult = pipe.score(X_ts, y_ts.values) # this line is the problem\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe model to output a score in this case, or a set of probability vectors when ```python predict_proba() ``` is called.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nUltimately I am trying to solve a multitask problem here. Any help is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.2 (tags/v3.8.2:7b3ab59, Feb 25 2020, 23:03:10) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nexecutable: c:\\users\\steven.belcher\\dev\\redberry\\snorkel_env\\scripts\\python.exe\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.18362-SP0\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 20.2.4\r\n   setuptools: 41.2.0\r\n      sklearn: 0.23.2\r\n        numpy: 1.18.5\r\n        scipy: 1.5.3\r\n       Cython: 0.29.21\r\n       pandas: 1.1.3\r\n   matplotlib: 3.3.2\r\n       joblib: 0.17.0\r\n        numba: 0.51.2\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: 0.17.0\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/460/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/460/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
