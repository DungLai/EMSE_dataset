Please describe.**\r\nI am not sure if this has been discussed or not, but I wanted to know if there is a way to load datasets with .fif, and .edf format? I have been drafting my gsoc proposal for the project and there is a high chance that I will come across these formats as I plan to use MNE library along with sktime for the EEG data analysis \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n What I'm trying to do here is write a function that converts .fif or .edf data into csv. I am looking for ways to interpret this solution. With the MNE library in python, csv is not a supported file format but in order to convert the  csv to the required format, we can read the csv with numpy and create a raw MNE object. I was wondering if something similar could be implemented here?\r\n  converting the .csv data into the required MNE data format looks something like this:\r\n```\r\nimport` numpy as np\r\nimport mne\r\n\r\n# Read the CSV file as a NumPy array\r\ndata = np.loadtxt('path/to/csv/file', delimiter=',')\r\n\r\n# Some information about the channels\r\nch_names = ['CH 1', 'CH 2', 'CH 3']  # TODO: finish this list\r\n\r\n# Sampling rate of the Nautilus machine\r\nsfreq = 500  # Hz\r\n\r\n# Create the info structure needed by MNE\r\ninfo = mne.create_info(ch_names, sfreq)\r\n\r\n# Finally, create the Raw object\r\nraw = mne.io.RawArray(data, info)\r\n\r\n# Plot it!\r\nraw.plot()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
