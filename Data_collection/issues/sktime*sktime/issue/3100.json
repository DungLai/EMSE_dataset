Appreciate you helping me through it. Re feedback on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3089, the pre-commit setup made life much easier for me so I think that’ll be helpful for others too. Only question for me is whether you also make clear that another option is to configure the ide to flag black and flake8 conventions for those who don’t want to use pre-commit. Not sure. Might be one of those things where more info is more confusing than helpful.\r\n\r\n@jelc53, not sure I understand - what is that other option you are referring to, i.e., \"configure the ide to flag black and flake8 conventions\"?\r\nI added an entire section called \"Integrating with your local developer IDE\" in #3089, so do you think this is not detailed enough, or is there a different option?\r\n\r\nHere: https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/developer_guide/coding_standards.html#integrating-with-your-local-developer-ide\r\n(you need to go to `latest` documentation to see the one on current `main`, the `stable` will always show the state at the last release)\r\n\r\nPull requests to improve the docs are also always appreciated!\r\nThe file in question is `developer_guide/coding_standards.rst`","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
