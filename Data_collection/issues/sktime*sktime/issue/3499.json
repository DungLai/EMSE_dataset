And this parameter is 'False' in default. So I think it means this fuction support length-uneuqal series. \r\n However, if I provide **a time series with 2 variates, 250 cases in different length**,  this function will returns '**ValueError: all input arrays must have the same shape'**.If I keep those cases in same length, it works. \r\nI think it maybe a bug? \r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI provide the following code to reproduce the bug.\r\nPS: one of length-equal variable df1 has been commented out.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import write_dataframe_to_tsfile\r\nfrom sktime.datatypes._panel._convert import from_multi_index_to_nested\r\n\r\n##df1=pd.DataFrame([[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,2],[2,3,3,3],[2,4,4,4],[2,5,5,5],[3,6,6,6]],columns=['a','b','c','d'])\r\ndf1=pd.DataFrame ([[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,2],[2,3,3,3],[2,4,4,4],[3,5,5,5],[3,6,6,6]],columns=['a','b','c','d'])\r\n\r\ndf1.set_index(keys=['a','b'],inplace=True)\r\nprint(df1)\r\n\r\nY_nested = from_multi_index_to_nested(df1)\r\n##print(Y_nested.head())\r\nwrite_dataframe_to_tsfile(data=Y_nested,equal_length= False,fold='_TRAIN',path='./path')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nProviding length-unequal time series is important, because even the same motion may cost time more or less. \r\nBesides, there are some length-unequal time series archieve in UCR archieve, such like Basic_Motions so  i think sktime is supposed to provide a way for user to create a length-unequal time series in .ts format. \r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\nsktime 0.13.2\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
