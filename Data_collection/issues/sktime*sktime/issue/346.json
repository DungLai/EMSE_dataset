Instead of adding/subtracting `n`, use `n * obj.freq`_\r\n\r\nThis error occurs when I try a plot (plot_ys) and when I try to predict (y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)).\r\n\r\nFor fixing the plot, I modified the file \"sktime/utils/plotting/forecasting.py\" in the line:\r\n\r\n_-continuous_index = np.arange(y.index.min(), y.index.max() + 1)\r\n+continuous_index = np.arange(1, len(y) + 1)\r\n\r\n>> After the above change, I got a plot with the timestamp as the index.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48148271/87846860-b9046280-c8f0-11ea-9c48-56096e428773.png)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for predict, the following file needs fixing : sktime/forecasting/base/_fh.py in line:\r\n\r\n-values = self + cutoff \r\n+values = (self * cutoff.freq) + cutoff\r\n\r\nBecause, here direct addition is not possible due to the TimeStamp index. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/shruthibalaji2307/e10dcae314773e75f6a03d4c43246f71\r\n\r\n**Input Data**\r\n[nation_level_daily.zip](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/files/4941236/nation_level_daily.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected plot_ys to plot my data without cribbing about the TimeStamp index.
