Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThere is a DummyClassifier in the classification package. It would be useful to have an equivalent straw man in the Regression package for those who think they are a sensible benchmark. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA class DummyRegressor that extends BaseRegressor using the template that predicts the mean of the response variable in the train file. Other dummy settings could be possible. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe can just work out the mean and use it as a benchmark, as we could with class distribution, but since there is a DummyClassifier, seems there should be a DummyRegressor. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3899/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
