If so, how do we deal with windows specific stuff such as WSL?\r\n* possibly move step 2 in sequence with step 1 and step 3 since step 2 is no longer highly complicated (since removal of C)\r\n\r\nFYI @lmmentel, did you make the change that shortens step 2?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
