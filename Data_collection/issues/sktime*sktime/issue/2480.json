Please describe.**\r\nThe Move-Split-Merge (MSM) distance function \r\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6189346\r\nis the top performing distance function for both 1NN classification and kmeans clustering of time series, significantly outperforming the better known dynamic time warping in both situations. The current sktime implementation\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/distances/_msm.py\r\ncannot currently handle multivariate input. It would be great if someone could adapt it. If someone does this, there could be the option to collaborate on its evaluation for multivariate time series classification and clustering, which may lead to a publication. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe reason MSM is not adapted to multivariate is that it is not immediately obvious how to do it. Our preferred solution would be an implementation of the method described by Ahmed Shifaz\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10231\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNote that this needs to be implemented in numba. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
