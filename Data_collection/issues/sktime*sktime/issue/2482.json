Please describe.**\r\nSpade is a distance function proposed here\r\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4221727\r\nand used in some comparisons, for example here\r\nhttps://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/vldb_08_Experimental_comparison_time_series.pdf\r\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/1454159.1454226\r\n(there is another more recent comparison I cant find the link for right now, will post it anon)\r\n\r\nWe have not used Spade in any of our distance experiments, because it did not perform very well in the above study. However, that was 15 years ago and it would be timely to re-evaluate it through an sktime implementation.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA numba based function modelled along the lines of existing distances.
