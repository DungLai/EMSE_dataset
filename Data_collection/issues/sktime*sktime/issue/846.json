Please describe.**\r\nsktime currently has a function \"plot_series\" for plotting time series. I am thinking of introducing Imaging of time series in \"plot_series\", which is transforming time series into images, a popular transformation. Imaging algorithms are \"recurrence plot\", \"Gramian Angular Summation Field\", \"Gramian Angular Difference Field\", and \"Markov Transition Field\". One important upside of this transformation is retrieving information for any pair of time points (x_i, x_j) given a time series (x_1, . . . , x_n). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nplot_series(series, labels=None, markers=None, imaging_method=None): \r\n-> This will plot one or more time series, that is plot_series default task\r\n\r\nplot_series(series, labels=None, markers=None, imaging_method = \"recurrence_plot\") \r\n-> This will give recurrence plot\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that the existing codebase wouldn't get hampered as we are introducing a default parameter.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/846/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
