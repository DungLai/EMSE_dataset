Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\n\r\n`sktime.datatypes._utilities.get_window` does slicing of time series objects. Splitters and `temporal_train_test_split` in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split` do, at least on the surface, the same task. It probably makes sense to unify how splitting is done across the library.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen, ideally taking into consideration the existing toolbox design, classes and methods.\r\n\r\nUse on of the classes/functions in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split` to at least partially replace seemingly duplicate `sktime.datatypes._utilities.get_window`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
