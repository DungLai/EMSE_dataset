notebooks\r\n\r\n## use cases:\r\n* search for suitable algorithms given a problem\r\n* search for information about a given algorithm\r\n\r\n## reference example from mlr3 library:\r\n*

questions:\r\n* integrate it with API reference: https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/api_reference.html (adding columns to that table)?\r\n\r\n## notes:\r\n* make clear that not all algorithm are reference implementations, even though we link them with the original research paper, some may be re-implemented, adapted or interfaced from other packages\r\n* encourage people to ping algorithm maintainers directly when they have questions about algorithm using the GitHub user name\r\n* Adding col for maintainer using
