This should support a single setting, or multiple settings. I would make a method `get_testing_param_defaults` or similar. Imports of components etc should happen inside this method, to avoid strong coupling of modules and circular imports.\r\n* default inhabitants of scitypes should move to the registry. I would suggest a method `get_example(scitype : str)`, which implements an extensible dispatch mechanusm similar to #1097.\r\n\r\nI think this would declutter the logic a lot, and make extending `sktime` much easier - since it reduces the \"points of extension\" by one. Defaeult parameters would no longer have to be entered in `_config`, but become part of the list of things to implement, in the extension template.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1098/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
