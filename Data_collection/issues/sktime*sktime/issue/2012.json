See https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2004\r\n* a newly emergent issue of random worker crashes after an innocuous move to testing classes, in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1992. See #1999 and https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2003\r\n* issues that I face in local testing on my windows machine - after a number of runs, vs code crashes; also, it creates a number of stray processes which eat memory and have to be killed manually\r\n\r\nThis indicates to me that `pytest-xdist` is still a bit immature, and at risk of causing unexplainable, hard to diagnose CI/CD issues. Do we really know when it strikes next, or how corretness of the tests is impacted?\r\n\r\nI do think, hence, that we should remove it from our CI/CD set-up.\r\nThe cost is, roughly, a doubling of CI/CD time, since the current set-up uses test parallelization with 2 workers.\r\n\r\nFYI @lmmentel.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2012/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
