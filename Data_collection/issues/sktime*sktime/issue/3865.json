Please describe.**\r\nThis issue aims to identify sections in sktime governance that are \"undemocratic\". General idea of this discussion is to give more power to the core developers to avoid that individuals can take hostage of sktime. \r\n\r\nUndemocratic in this context are for example current gov items:\r\n- Single individuals can block nomination of CC or CoC members, \r\nsee #3939\r\n- CC can supersede core dev votes. This can lead to offending majority of core devs,\r\nsee #3937\r\n- CC and CoC nominations are currently for lifetime. This should be changed, so a nomination ends e.g. after 2 years. Then another core dev vote has to happen. This is common practice in any org that claims to have a democratic governance. \r\nsee #3868\r\n- Separation of power between CC and CoC, currently there is no separation on member level.\r\nsee #3870\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI will make separate PRs for the different topics. Discussion can happen at PR. General discussion can happen at this issue.
