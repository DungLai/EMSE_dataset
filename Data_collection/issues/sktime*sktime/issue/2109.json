To make oneÂ´s life easy, arguments for both methods could default to the same argument set, like in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2100 for `predict`-like methods.\r\n- [ ] we should write output tests for `predict_var` and `predict_proba` in `test_all_forecasters`\r\n- [ ] testing equality is turned off for outputs of `predict_proba` since that is a `tfp` `Distribution`. This may need thinking, e.g., what to replace the \"arrays equal\" test by, or whether it is fine to continue skipping.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
