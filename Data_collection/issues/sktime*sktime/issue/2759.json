But there might be better ways of doing this as well! This way at least seems backwards compatible but provides an interface where the user doesn't need to know about all the different classes!\r\n\r\nAs for `GridSearch`, we currently support 2 ways of doing it. Either use the `sklearn` `GridSearch`, or you can use the `GridSearch` functionalities under forecasting -> model_selection. If you choose the later - you get something that behaves like an estimator. (a forecaster to be specific), and the former returns a dict of cv search results.  I think that classification (and perhaps after this summer ....... various annotation tasks!) are also interesting and worthwhile questions you might have about time series data, and might want to use a MultiplexTransformer for, and I think it could be nice to have a more unified `GridSearch` approach to support these goals.\r\n\r\nOne option - could be to move `BaseGridSearch` into a more general location, and make it less \"forecasty\". Perhaps it could live with `HeterogenousMetaEstimator`? Then we replace the current `BaseGridSearch` with `BaseForecastingSearch`, that adds the forecaster functionality. Hopefully this would not change the user-facing grid search classes - ie I don't think anyone uses `BaseGridSearch` on its own, though I could be wrong! Now we at least we have the optionality of building GridSearch-like estimators for other tasks other than forecasting?\r\n\r\nThere is a growth in classes though. I wonder if there is a better way to achieve this? :)  Just kicking off the discussion here per @fkiraly's suggestion. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
