Please describe.**\r\n\r\nrunning test_all_estimators requires all of the soft dependencies be installed. This is annoying when new ones are introduced, particularly when reinstalling all_extras causes fbprophet to reinstall wrong versions of things and it all needs resetting.  I am getting strange bugs with the testing results passing locally but not on the repo, so need to do some testing, but would rather not deal with fpbprophet and  dtw_python issues. It would also speed up my development time, testing takes an age\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to be able to run tests locally on hard and soft dependency modules with test_all_estimators and test_all_panel_estimators. Simply splitting the files and iterating over different lists would be fine.\r\n\r\n \r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI can locally hack out the tests into a separate file, but would rather not\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
