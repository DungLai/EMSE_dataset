For example, #322 \r\n\r\nWe could add checks and more appropriate error messages at the beginning of the files suggesting to run `pip install <soft_dependency>`. \r\n\r\nWe could add the following function:\r\n```python\r\nfrom importlib import import_module\r\n\r\ndef _check_imports(package):\r\n    try:\r\n        import_module(package)\r\n    except ModuleNotFoundError:\r\n        msg = f\"No module named {package}. {package} is a soft dependency in sktime and is not included in the sktime installation.
