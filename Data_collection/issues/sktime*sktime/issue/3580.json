Please describe.**\r\n- sktime stores trained y and trained X in the internal memory of the forecast as `self._y` and `self._X`. To my knowledge, this is currently stored in memory as Pandas Series / DataFrames?\r\n- I've been looking at long-term storage of fitted sktime forecasters  (using `cloudpickle`) and some pickled models can be quite large if fitted in high frequency long-horizon data. This seems related to `self._y` and `self._X`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- Parquet is an efficient storage format with fast read performance.\r\n- Most DataFrame mtypes supported by sktime e.g. pandas can be easily converted into a pyarrow table (then stored into a `BytesIO` buffer).\r\n- Benefits: lower memory usage at rest + a consistent representation for time series data stored in internal memory + smaller pickled model sizes for long-term storage\r\n- Cons: need to implement a few new mtype conversion functions using `pyarrow`. Parquet might not be the ideal storage type for numpy array or xarray y_train\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n- The status quo.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3580/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
