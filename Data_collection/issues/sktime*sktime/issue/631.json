T. Górecki and prof. T. Łuczak we are currently working on adjusting Similarity Forest (proposed by S. Sathe and C.C. Aggrawal [reference](http://saketsathe.net/downloads/simforest.pdf) ) to time series data. It seems to be very fast (~ O(n log(n)/O(log(n) for training/inference) and at the same time more accurate than e.g. TSF. We are going to develop this method and would like to make it widely available. Sktime seems to be a perfect place for that.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/631/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
