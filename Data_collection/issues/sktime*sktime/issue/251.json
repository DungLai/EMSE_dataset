Overview of basic unit test framework for sktime\r\n\r\n### References issues\r\n#246, #25 \r\n\r\n### All estimators\r\nTests common to all estimator objects in sktime, adapted list from

\"inverse_transform\") does not change fitted parameters\r\n- [x] check fit does not overwrite hyper-parameters (also add checks for other methods like predict, transform etc)\r\n- [x] check not
