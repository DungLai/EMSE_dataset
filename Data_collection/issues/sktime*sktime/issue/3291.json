Even if all are from the  scitype Series.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.ets import AutoETS\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nets = AutoETS()\r\nets.fit(np.random.random(100))\r\nets.update_predict(np.random.random(10))```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect that update_predict works with every mtype that implements the series scitype. If this is not possible, I would suggest that the documentation of update_predict in forecasting._base is updated. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI suppose that it would work if in line 2210 of forecasting._base the instance is checked against a list of all scitypes instead of only checked against the pd.Series and pd.DataFrames.\r\n\r\nIf it should also work with np.arrays, I can take a look if it is possible to check the against all mtypes.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects also the issues which proposes to add new mtypes. E.g., #2655\r\n\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.18362-SP0\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.0.3\r\n   setuptools: 60.8.2\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.2\r\n       sktime: 0.13.1\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.21.6\r\n        scipy: 1.7.3\r\n       pandas: 1.4.1\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.1\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.1\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.5\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
