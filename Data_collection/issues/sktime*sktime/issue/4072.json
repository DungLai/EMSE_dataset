Please describe.**\r\nWhen you try to run the function `predict_intervals` off an ExponentialSmoothing forecasting object, you get the following error:\r\n\"NotImplementedError: ExponentialSmoothing does not have the capability to return prediction intervals. If you think this estimator should have the capability, please open an issue on sktime.\"\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt seems like statsmodels has two generalized exponential smoothing classes. By generalized I mean that they can contain trends and seasonalities. These are [ETSModel](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.exponential_smoothing.ets.ETSModel.html) and [holtswinter.ExponentialSmoothing](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing.html). Sktime currently interfaces holtswinter.ExponentialSmoothing but I think it should try to interface ETSModel instead as it is the more feature-rich version.\r\n\r\nAs you can see at the end of [this page](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/ets.html), ETSModel can do prediction intervals and simulations.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis feature request is similar to https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1362\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4072/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
