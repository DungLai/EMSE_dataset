For this case:\r\n```Python\r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\r\n```\r\nWe already know there cannot be another `RandomForestClassifier` class and the libs from `sklearn.ensemble` are not big. Therefore, this seems to a balanced solution for both `0.23.x` to `0.24.x` version of `scikit_learn`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? If you also agree with this suggestion then I will pull a request to fix that.
