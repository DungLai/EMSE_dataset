Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, we're using `sphinx-panel` as an [extension](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/3c56f535dc1d060c0053ab6c7f1a1a7199133539/docs/source/conf.py#L51) to build documentation. However, in the current state, `sphinx-panel` is not being actively [maintained](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-design/issues/51) and they suggest using [`sphinx-design`](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-design) instead.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere is a migration [guide](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html#migrating-from-sphinx-panels) which can be followed. Changes involve replacing `panel`, `link-button` etc. directives with their updated versions. It might not be as simple as refactoring the names since there seem to be some differences in their formatting as well.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3370/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3370/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
