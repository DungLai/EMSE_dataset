While very flexible, the nested pd.DataFrame is slow and continues to cause a lot of bugs and confusion on the side of users and contributors.\r\n\r\nI propose the following steps to change it:\r\n- [x] Add support for 3d numpy arrays with shape = (n_instances, n_variables, n_timepoints) for rectangular/time-homogeneous data,\r\n- [x] Make 3d numpy arrays the default data container, with automatic conversion from nested pd.DataFrames to 3d numpy arrays in input checks, except in a few cases where we need to support time-heterogeneous data,\r\n- [x] Adding full support for multiple data containers, possibly with estimator tags (class attributes) for supported output types, returning the same output type as input type whenever possible. \r\n\r\nI've not started implementing anything yet, I suspect there will be a few more complicates which I haven't thought about. The proposed change would touch almost every file for the series-as-features setting. \r\n\r\nMore details in our enhancement proposal: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/master/steps/02_data_container/step.md\r\n\r\nAny feedback and ideas welcome!
