Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, window length parameters (e.g. `window_length` or `initial_window` in `SlidingWindowSplitter`) have to be integers and denote the absolute number of time points, similar to how scikit-learn handles fractions in their cross-validation functionality. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd support for floats denoting the number of time points relative to the passed data. For example passing `window_length=0.5` would mean half of the data `y` passed to `split` in the `SlidingWindowSplitter`.\r\n\r\nThe parameters `window_length` and `initial_window` are used in several locations in the code base.
