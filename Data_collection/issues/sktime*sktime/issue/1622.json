Please describe.**\r\nI want to use specific lagged series such as [y(t-1), y(t-24), y(t-48), y(t-168)]. If I specify window length as 168, my reduction method is going to take all the lagged series starting from y(t-1), y(t-2)... y(t-168)]. I would prefer it to be an array just like fh (forecast horizon). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nwindow_length should take an ndarray and created lagged series based on the numbers in window_length. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently, I do not have any alternative. \r\n**Additional context**\r\nBelow code demonstrates, what I want to achieve.\r\n```\r\nlags = [0,1,2,3,23,24,25,26,167,168,169]\r\nfor i in (lags):\r\n        target_ts['variable_to_be_predicted_lag_' + str(i + 1)] = target_ts['variable_to_be_predicted'].shift(i + 1)\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
