I've implemented a number of basic unit tests that ensure consistency for estimators in our framework and compatibility with scikit-learn. \r\n\r\nMany of our estimators already pass the tests and some of them were easy to fix. However, others still need some reworking. \r\n\r\nWhat I need you to do is:\r\n* please review the changes in #246 that affect your estimators/files and let me know if there's anything that I should not have changed \r\n* please open a PR to implement the necessary fixes based on the `refactor` branch (or `dev` branch once it's merged)\r\n* if you have reproducible benchmarking results for a given data set, it'd be great to add a unit test that ensures reproducibility\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need help or are unable to make these changes. \r\n\r\nYou can find the list of estimators that need to be fixed below. The unit tests are implemented in [`sktime/tests/`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/refactor/sktime/tests) and [`sktime/utils/testing/`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/refactor/sktime/utils/testing/estimator_checks.py).\r\n| Estimator | Author | Fixed |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| BOSSEnsemble | @MatthewMiddlehurst | #263 |\r\n| ColumnTransformer  | @mloning | #246 |\r\n| ContractedShapeletTransform  | @jasonlines | #329 |\r\n| ElasticEnsemble  | @jasonlines |\r\n| KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier  | @jasonlines  | #689 |\r\n| MrSEQLClassifier  | @lnthach | #264 |\r\n| PCATransformer  | @prockenschaub | #262 |\r\n| ProximityForest  | @goastler |\r\n| ProximityStump  | @goastler |\r\n| ProximityTree  | @goastler |\r\n| RandomIntervalSpectralForest  | @TonyBagnall  | #246 |\r\n| Rocket  | @angus924 | #266 |\r\n| RowTransformer  | @mloning | #246 |\r\n| SFA  | @MatthewMiddlehurst | #263 |\r\n| SAX  | @MatthewMiddlehurst | #263| \r\n| ShapeletTransform  | @jasonlines | #329 |\r\n| ShapeletTransformClassifier  | @jasonlines @TonyBagnall | #329 |\r\n| TimeSeriesForestClassifier  | @mloning | #246  | \r\n| TimeSeriesForestRegressor  | @mloning | #246 |\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
