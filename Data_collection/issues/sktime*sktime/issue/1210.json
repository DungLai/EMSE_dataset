Describe the issue linked to the documentation\r\nI would like to enhance the docstring of `StackingForecaster` regarding \r\n\r\n- what it does\r\n- when it is useful\r\n- how to use it (example)\r\n- adding reference, if existing\r\n\r\n@mloning could you please provide me some infos, I would do the rest then :)\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n- why is it mandatory for `final_regressor` to be a regressor and could this not also be a forecaster?\r\n- I understood that a usecase is HTS data where you have `n` lower level forecasts and one high level forecaster which uses the lower level predictions as exog data. Is this correct?\r\n\r\n@GuzalBulatova fyi","closed_by":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
