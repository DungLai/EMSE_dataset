Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI've been playing with the `ForecastingGridSearchCV`. It works well , however for one of the forecasters in our tests, *some but not all fits fail*. Happily there is handling for failed fits with the score for this being set by `error_score=np.nan`. However, the `out.mean()` in the `_fit` method of the `ForecastingGridSearchCV` [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/bd8d7c531d2dc3eb947ae31613dd929dc9f0d72f/sktime/forecasting/model_selection/_tune.py#L150) has `skipna=True` by default, which means that the final cross-validation score ignores the NaNs when calculating the mean over the folds, which results in a non-nan result which could be misleading. Say for example all folds failed except for one, then the user will get a non-nan mean score and might not notice!\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nFirst, I think that `out.mean(skip_na=False)` would be a more appropriate default, especially given `error_score=np.nan` by default, so the user doesn't fall into a trap of misinterpreting the mean.\r\n\r\nSecond, some user control over the aggregation function would be desirable. In this case the user could then reintroduce the `skip_na=True` behaviour, or put in a median instead of a mean, or something entirely different, if that is how they'd rather aggregate scores over folds. The implementation would need a new kwarg in `ForecastingGridSearchCV` where the user could specify the score aggregation function and the name (I would think similar to how the user injects their own per-fold scorer).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nBecause of the issue above I've taken to setting `error_score=np.inf` so that the mean returns `np.inf` when one fit fails.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis request is related to Discord chat message at https://discord.com/channels/723500657255907408/725717099376541708/1019494739969593364\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3446/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
