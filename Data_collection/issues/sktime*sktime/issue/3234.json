The problem is that` evaluate() `does not return the last fitted forecaster but it can optionally return the `y_train `for each forecaster, so we can take that data to fit the forecaster if not refit :)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_shampoo_sales\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import (\r\n    ExpandingWindowSplitter,\r\n    ForecastingGridSearchCV,\r\n    ExpandingWindowSplitter)\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.naive import NaiveForecaster\r\ny = load_shampoo_sales()\r\nfh = [1,2,3]\r\ncv = ExpandingWindowSplitter(\r\n    start_with_window=True,\r\n    fh=fh)\r\nforecaster = NaiveForecaster()\r\nparam_grid = {\"strategy\" : [\"last\", \"mean\", \"drift\"]}\r\ngscv = ForecastingGridSearchCV(\r\n    forecaster=forecaster,\r\n    param_grid=param_grid,\r\n    cv=cv,\r\n    refit=False)\r\ngscv.fit(y)\r\ngscv.predict(fh=[1,2,3])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf `refit is False`, then the last `y_train` from cross-validation should be used as fit data \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n`main`\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
