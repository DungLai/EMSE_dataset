Please describe.**\r\nWith #1130 (not merged yet at the time of writing this issue), the naive model accounts for seasonal periodicity and is robust against NaN values for all strategies except the drift strategy.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAs pointed out in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1130#issue-688158837, if the drift strategy would use the same util functions as the other strategies, this would:\r\n\r\n- make it robust against NaN values, both at the end of the time series and at the start\r\n- let it account for seasonal periodicity\r\n\r\nThe `\"handles-missing-data\"` tag for the naive model could then be switched to `True` (it currently doesn't seem possible to assign this tag on a strategy level, although there is some ongoing discussion about assigning tags in #981).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatively, I tentatively propose the drift method might be eligible for removal? I don't see the use case for this strategy, which is why I am not attempting to fix this myself.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
