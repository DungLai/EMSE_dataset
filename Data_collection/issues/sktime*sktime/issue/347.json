Please describe.**\r\nWhen we load a pandas series as input data, Python datetime indices are not supported by sktime, only simple numerical indices are supported.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe datetime index provides much more clarity while plotting and analyzing the data. Sktime must support series that have a datetime index and add appropriate computations in the datetime context.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI have tried using the numerical index, but it does not clearly indicate the unit of the time, whether it represents seconds, minutes, days, weeks, or months.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMore details about this are posted in this Bug : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/346\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
