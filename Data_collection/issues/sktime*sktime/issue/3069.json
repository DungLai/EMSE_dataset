This results in OOM errors and crashes when training on very large datasets. For example, I cannot train `AutoETS` model on the `electricity` dataset from the Monash repository on a machine with 300GB of RAM.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in the following line of code in [`sktime.datatypes._utilities.py`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/5767dbaac759ed6ac43a8977f4c46beb93d0f18c/sktime/datatypes/_utilities.py#L299) \r\n```python\r\nseries_idx = [obj.loc[x].index.get_level_values(-1) for x in idx.droplevel(-1)]\r\n```\r\nSuppose our dataset consists of 300 time series each of length 20000, stacked into a `DataFrame` with `MultiIndex` (level 0 = time series ID, level 1 = timestamp). The above line of code will try to create an array with 20000 * 20000 entries, even though we actually only need an array with 300 * 20000 entries.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datatypes import get_cutoff\r\nfrom sktime.utils._testing.hierarchical import _make_hierarchical\r\n\r\ndf = _make_hierarchical((300,), max_timepoints=20000, min_timepoints=20000)\r\nget_cutoff(df)  # program gets stuck and eventually crashes with in an OOM error\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe code shouldn't result in an OOM error.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAn easy solution to this problem is to replace L299 in [`sktime.datatypes._utilities.py`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/5767dbaac759ed6ac43a8977f4c46beb93d0f18c/sktime/datatypes/_utilities.py#L299) \r\n```python\r\nseries_idx = [obj.loc[x].index.get_level_values(-1) for x in idx.droplevel(-1)]\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```python\r\nseries_idx = [obj.loc[x].index.get_level_values(-1) for x in idx.droplevel(-1).unique()]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n```\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.1.2\r\n   setuptools: 63.2.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.1.1\r\n       sktime: 0.13.0\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.22.4\r\n        scipy: 1.8.1\r\n       pandas: 1.4.3\r\n   matplotlib: None\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.2\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
