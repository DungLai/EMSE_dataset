Please describe.**\r\n\r\nYes. As noticed by @KishManani in the slack, using `pandas` 1.5.2 for rolling operations (e.g. `df.rolling(window=window_size).mean()` ) throws a future warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFutureWarning: min_periods=None will default to the size of window consistent with other methods in a future version. Specify min_periods=0 instead.\r\n```\r\nSo, it means that the behaviour of `WindowSummarizer` transformer (which uses `rolling` and doesn't specify `min_periods` at the moment) will change if in future `pandas` changes the default behaviour to be `min_periods=0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nExplicitly specifying `min_period` with the value of window length can make `WindowSummarizer` to retain it's behaviour even after `pandas` changes the default.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
