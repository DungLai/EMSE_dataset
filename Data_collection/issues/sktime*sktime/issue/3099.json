Will add and check things off as I get to them:\r\n\r\n- [ ] add Baum-Welch logic to `_fit` so that the parameters which are used in the Viterbi algorithm can be dynamically extracted from the data. \r\n- [ ] Expand support to multi-dimensional data (should be a simple extension!)\r\n- [ ] Move beyond the assumption of equal time spacing\r\n- [ ] Add support for partially observed data\r\n- [ ] For a \"fitted\" HMM add the option to \"sample\" from the model.\r\n- [x] Write a wrapper for hmmlearn\r\n- [ ] write an example use case/notebook of how to use it\r\n- [ ] Look at implementing other statistical methods eg CRF\r\n\r\nFYI @lmmentel ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3099/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
