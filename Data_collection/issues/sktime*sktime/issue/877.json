Please describe.**\r\nSktime's `BaseEstimator` inherits from scikit-learn's `BaseEstimator` and adds functionality for getting estimator tags and checking if an estimator has been fitted. \r\n\r\nThe functionality to check if an estimator is fitted (and the `is_fitted` property) are not needed for \"non-fitable\" Sktime classes (for instance performance_metrics). However, these Sktime would benefit from inheriting from a base Sktime object that includes the estimator tag functionality. Additionally, if these classes inherit from Sktime's BaseEstimator it causes problems for unit testing that is designed to test \"fitable\" estimators.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCreate an Sktime `BaseObject` class that inherits from scikit-learn's `BaseEstimator` and only adds the method for returning estimator tags. \r\n\r\nSktime's BaseEstimator can then inherit from the `BaseObject` and add the functionality that applies to estimators (e.g. `is_fitted` and `check_is_fitted`).\r\n\r\nAdd appropriate unit tests for BaseObject.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nPrimary alternative is to copy functionality needed functionality from BaseEstimator (e.g. #858), but inheriting the functionality is much cleaner and less error prone. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/877/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
