provides functionality for fusing series-to-tabular transformers with tabular supervised learning methods.\r\n\r\nThis should be interfaced, or replicated in the more general interface.\r\n\r\nIn this

series-to-tabular with a tabular SL method to obtain a TSC/TSR method.\r\n\r\nConditional on a consolidated interface design as in https://github.com/kiraly-group/sktime/issues/5 and
