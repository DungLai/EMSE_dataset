Please describe.**\r\nMLFlow is a powerful package itotrack, log, save and deploy ML models. It allows users to save a record of every parameters and  experiments for analysis in a user-friendly manner. Such model can be deploy in the exact state when it was created later on. It would be good to investigate MLFlow's implementation of sktime in the context of benchmarking. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA simple implementationof MLFlow to demonstrate that it can perform benchmark using sktime's metrics, dataset and estimators. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOpenML, gluonts, kotsu. Refer to Issue #2777 \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TNTran92","id":55965636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTY1NjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92","html_url":"https://github.com/TNTran92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNTran92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2916/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
