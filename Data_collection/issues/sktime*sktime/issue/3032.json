In that case, we still need to think about testing, but can exclude most existing estimators.\r\nThis might be useful if it turns out that most current estimators cannot actually handle duplicate or irregular time indices.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
