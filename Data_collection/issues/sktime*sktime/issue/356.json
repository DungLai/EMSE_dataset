Please describe.**\r\n\r\nDICOM for data is standard for storing images in hospitals. However, it can also be used to store \"waveform\" data such as ECG. Analysing this data with sktime requires expertise in converting and formatting. It would be great to embed tools to transform DICOM time series into ts format.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nthere are existing DICOM interfaces in python. These should be explored and hopefully facilitate the translation. \r\n\r\n1) This should involve code to form a single file including time series for a single patient record, where meta information is stored in the .ts file header.  \r\n2) post processing code to form different problem types such as clustering, classification and anomaly detection. \r\n\r\nthere is a lot of leg work to make this happen and we will need to define some more meta info in the .ts format. \r\n\r\nThe whole issue of data extraction/formatting might be better in a sister package at sktime.org?
