Please describe.**\r\nAs discussed in dev-days  meeting on 15-07-2022 and #2935 , #2991 adding ability to run the neural models on GPU is extremely useful. We need to add functionality to support GPU and multi-GPU:\r\n\r\nFor GPU functionality:\r\n1. A user would need tensorflow-gpu and cuda-toolkit installed. We will have to add them as a soft dependency? I am unsure if these are required since pytorch (which I am comfortable with) does not really require them\r\n2. We can also have the functionality of multi-gpu: https://keras.io/guides/distributed_training/ . In my estimate majority of the people using sktime would be on kaggle / collab in which case there is a single gpu used. And time series data should not be so heavy that multi-gpu are required, but there might be few using it on larger data / maybe college gpu cluster where they might have easy access to gpus and would prefer running the models with multiple gpus? It might be worth having in those cases","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3020/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
