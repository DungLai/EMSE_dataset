Please describe.**\r\nThe current implementation is controlling the randomness using `numpy.seed` e.g. [line 140](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/2ab70b78caf30f3a5fa1ea516ba4179dd44ba632/sktime/transformations/panel/rocket/_minirocket_multivariate.py#L140). This is considered bad practice according to the numpy docs here: \r\nhttps://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.seed.html?highlight=seed#numpy.random.seed\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe suggested approach for controlling the random generator is to create a new RandomState instance. Scikit-Learn has a nice function [sklearn.utils.check_random_state](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.check_random_state.html) that takes all the different inputs (`int, None, RandomState`) and returns the appropriate RandomState. The solution should replace `np.random.seed(seed)` with `rng = check_random_state(self.random_state)` and then any calls of the type `np.random.choice(...)`, or `np.random.randint(...)` with `rng.choice(...)`, `rng.randint(...)`. Example code:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_random_state\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nrng = check_random_state(self.random_state)\r\n\r\n#Â replace all calls from np.random to rng\r\nrng.choice(...)\r\nrng.randint(...)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ltsaprounis","id":64217214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE3MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64217214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis","html_url":"https://github.com/ltsaprounis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ltsaprounis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2568/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
