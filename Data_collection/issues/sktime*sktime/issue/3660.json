Most are situated in the main package folder i.e. `sktime.classification.base.py`, but the files surrounding the base classes and their availability in the `__init__.py` file will change from package to package. \r\n\r\nFor base classes which are in an `__init__.py` with other estimators or situated in a subpackage, any imports will also import the surrounding estimators. While rather niche, this can possibly lead to situations like the one seen in #3634 where unrelated estimators are being imported through base class imports in the `registry` package.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to have a similar structure for all packages.\r\n\r\nA few ideas, though feel free to suggest others:\r\n\r\n1. Move base classes to the `base` package, i.e. `from sktime.base import BaseForecaster` or `from sktime.base._base import BaseForecaster`. Possibly in subpackages i.e. `from sktime.base.forecasting import BaseForecaster` or `from sktime.base.forecasting._base import BaseForecaster`.\r\n2. Place the files in the main package i.e. `from sktime.forecasting import BaseForecaster` or `from sktime.forecasting._base import BaseForecaster`. This would require no files other than the base class to use the top level `__init__.py`.\r\n3. Have base class subpackages i.e. `from sktime.forecasting.base import BaseForecaster` or `from sktime.forecasting.base._base import BaseForecaster`. This also requires no top level `__init__.py` usage.\r\n4.
