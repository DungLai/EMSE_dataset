Plays at power grab, election fraud, or asset seizure are unlikely to succeed.\r\n* the electorate is the *entire contributor community*, i.e., anyone in the world and also potentially from anonymous accounts. This seems much less a biased approach than gatekeeping by a small community that has historically formed around certain research groups and is currently not very diverse.\r\n* eligibility to election *requires having made a certain amount of contributions* overall and recently. In `sktime`, these could be org, events, mentoring new contributors, as well as code - explicitly not implying that code is the only valuable contribution. Only that who wants to lead must have contributed and contributed recently (and not just playing a popularity game).\r\n* occupying *higher power roles requires a degree of transparency*, disclosure of conflicts of interest, and going through a managed scrutiny phase.\r\n\r\nGiven that the contributor community has grown, and recent discussions on the topic, `sktime` is perhaps ready to think about this wider governance model.\r\n\r\nI also do think before we enact substantial changes to our governance model, we need to ensure that we think carefully about a broader process by which the wider contributor community can be involved.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3890/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
