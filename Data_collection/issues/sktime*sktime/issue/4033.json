be only on python 3.9, but this is due to the matrix design which spreads estimators across version/OS combinations.\r\n\r\nIn theory, it could be a 3.9 specific failure, but I think that is less likely than windows specifity (although it may be worth to test that by turning the `matrixdesign` flag off in the CI).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/4033/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
