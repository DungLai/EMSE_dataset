Please describe.**\r\nCurrently models from DARTS are not supported in sktime.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSince the DARTS models use a unified fit, predict format, it may be beneficial to have a DARTS adapter built into `sktime`. The catch seems to be that DARTS works on a proprietary format of data (`TimeSeries`), so the adapter will need to handle the conversion from `TimeSeries` to pd.Series and vice versa.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom darts import TimeSeries\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI tried creating the adapter outside of sktime. It trains OK, but the prediction does not work. Not sure what the issue is. Can someone help out please?\r\n\r\n**[Notebook with DARTS adapter](https://gist.github.com/ngupta23/d876b55fdfc47e5573b209d3aa5be222)**","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1624/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
