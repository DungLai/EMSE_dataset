This inefficient vectorization should be removed, and the transformers moved to the `transformations.series` module, with deprecation.\r\n\r\nOne of two things should happen:\r\n* inefficient/loop vectorization should be replaced with efficient vectorization; `X_inner_mtype` should be changed to something more efficient, e.g., `pd-multiindex` (a `Panel` mtype)\r\n* the vectorization should be removed, `X_inner_mtype` should be replaced with `pd.DataFrame` (a `Series` mtype). This will simplify the transformer and confer automated vectorization from the base class.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the `\"scitype:instancewise\"` tag should change to `True` (since a transform is applied by instance).\r\n\r\nThe following transformers have this issue:\r\n- [ ] `DWTTransformer`\r\n- [ ] `SlopeTransformer`\r\n\r\nUntil #1854 is merged, work on this should be based on #1854.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
