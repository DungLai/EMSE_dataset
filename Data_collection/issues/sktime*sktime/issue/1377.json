Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe currently support manylinux 2010 wheels. However, manylinux2010 reached its end-of-life last year and our dependencies are no longer supporting it going forward. \r\n\r\nTwo examples so far:\r\n1. llvmlite/numba stopped supporting manylinux 2010: https://github.com/numba/llvmlite/issues/768\r\n2. Pillow released version 8.3.2 today that no longer supports manylinux 2010: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files . This is breaking our CI\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDrop support for manylinux 2010 so we can use the latest versions of our dependencies \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nPin our dependencies to the last version that supports manylinux 2010. Or use separate dependencies only for manylinux2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1377/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
