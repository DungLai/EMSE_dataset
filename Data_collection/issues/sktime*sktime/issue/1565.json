Scikit-learn has a toggle button on their code examples to remove the \">>>\", \"...\", output and other items that are needed in the code-block, but make it difficult to copy the code directly.  We should implement something similar.\r\n\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTell us how we could improve the documentation in this regard.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe need to add javascript to every page that lets users hide the items described above so that the example code is easier to copy. We can easily adapt Scikit-learn's javascript blurb that does this. Then we need to make sure it is included on every page using a layout.html template.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
