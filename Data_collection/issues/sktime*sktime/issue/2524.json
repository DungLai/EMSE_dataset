I feel that this is somehow connected.\r\n\r\nI noticed that `ThetaForecaster` is unable to generate the prediction intervals when it's inside a `ForecastingPipeline`. It turns out that the problem is not with the pipeline but with the input being forced to be a `pd.DataFrame`.\r\nThe error i'm getting is:\r\n```python\r\nValueError: Unable to coerce to Series, length must be 1: given 36\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is connected with the addition of `y_pred` with `sem` in  `_predict_quantiles`, in theta.py.\r\nI'd offer a work around but I'm sure a temporal change of data type is not the best solution;-).\r\n\r\nBtw, is it expected that `sem` is a pd.Float64Index instance?\r\n\r\nHere's a toy example:\r\n```python\r\npd.DataFrame([1,2])+pd.Float64Index([.1,.2])\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\ny = load_airline()\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)\r\n\r\nfp = ThetaForecaster(sp=12)\r\nfp.fit(pd.DataFrame(y_train))\r\nfp.predict_quantiles(fh=y_test.index)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\ny = load_airline()\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)\r\n\r\nfp = ThetaForecaster(sp=12)\r\nfp.fit(y_train)\r\nfp.predict_quantiles(fh=y_test.index)\r\n```\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 05:59:45) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nexecutable: C:\\Users\\Mi\\miniconda3\\envs\\sktime-dev\\python.exe\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.22000-SP0\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.0.4\r\n   setuptools: 62.1.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.2\r\n       sktime: 0.11.2\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.22.3\r\n        scipy: 1.8.0\r\n       pandas: 1.4.2\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.1\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.53.0\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.5\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2524/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
