In the `datatypes` module.\r\n\r\nExample 1: `xarray` (series, panel, and hierarchical), as used in `pywatts`. FYI @benheid, @kalebphipps, @smeisen\r\nRelated: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2655\r\n\r\nExample 2: `ListDataset` (panel data), as used in `gluonts`. FYI @TNTran92, @AurumnPegasus, @ltsaprounis.\r\nRelated: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2893\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that adding examples naively, as of now, would attach the soft dependency imports to large parts of the `datatypes` module.\r\n\r\nSome ways out:\r\n\r\n* encapsulation as fixtures, similar to `pytest`, or directly via `pytest`, with imports inside the fixture. Plus, calling fixtures only when soft dependencies are installed.\r\n* relying on checks that does not import, or only imports late. E.g., instead of `isinstance(obj, ListDataset)`, use `type(obj).__name__ == \"ListDataset\"` etc.\r\n\r\nAny good ideas?","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2957/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
