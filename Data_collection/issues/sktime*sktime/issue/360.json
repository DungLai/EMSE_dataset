This has a number of disadvantages:\r\n\r\n* it adds a level of complication for new contributors, often PRs are created where new contributors have created a new branch based on dev and want to merge it into master or vice versa;\r\n* automatic updating of the CHANGELOG does not work nicely;\r\n* GitHub recognises only contributors that merge into master;\r\n* PRs into dev do not trigger doc builds, so changes to tutorial notebooks are not included in CI checks;\r\n* we need an additional PR where we collect all changes on dev and merge it into master for every new release (including merge conflicts, etc).\r\n\r\nInstead, we could work directly based on the master branch. New releases would be triggered by tags which I have set up already. \r\n\r\nThis is what other packages seem to do too (see e.g. scikit-learn). \r\n\r\n### What we would have to change:\r\n* contributing guidelines\r\n* automatic changelog builder (GitHub action)\r\n* add support for versioned documentation, otherwise docs built on master do not reflect latest release on PyPI","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
