During those experiments, i'm consistently getting the results that HC2 is slower than HC1 (using default parameters for both), which contradict the results given in the paper presenting HC2. That is, trying on multiple datasets, with and without using n_jobs>1.\r\n\r\nIs this an expected behavior due to some work in progress or something wrong on my side ?\r\n\r\nExample results on the Crop dataset with varying number of samples:\r\n\r\n|n_samples|RDST              |Rocket            |DrCIF             |HC1              |HC2               |STC              |RDST_std            |Rocket_std          |DrCIF_std         |HC1_std           |STC_std            |HC2_std           |\r\n|------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\r\n|225   |0.8935474371537566|0.4801460364833474|18.577583170495927|7848.464765178971|8959.079658895731 |86.56675709038973|0.04171504359692335 |0.010750255547463894|0.3076158696785569|4.683004071004689 |0.43590452894568443|25.00064292922616 |\r\n|450   |1.6947628241032362|0.8065409753471613|24.938918606378138|8360.594130783342|10547.514885107055|243.3796755867079|0.02757885307073593 |0.055771343410015106|0.2900445992127061|18.76490328181535 |1.9626950984820724 |43.63670677691698 |\r\n|675   |2.320853997953236 |0.9106023721396923|44.63115615211427 |8971.236895166337|12217.335100212134|430.5591306462884|0.028325325809419155|0.008519411087036133|1.7223147563636303|35.296641977503896|0.5699807498604059 |29.104480856098235|\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code used to produce my benchmark can be found here :\r\nhttps://github.com/baraline/convst/blob/main/PaperScripts/benchmark.py\r\n\r\nThe system i'm running the experiments on :\r\nDELL PowerEdge R730 on Debian 9 with 2 XEON E5-2630 Corei7 (92 cores) and 64GB of RAM\r\n\r\nSktime version : 0.10.1\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
