Such logic should be placed at the start of `_fit`\r\n2. dynamic tags need to be set in the `__init__`, since tags are read at the start of the `fit` call which precedes the `_fit` call\r\n3. we have the `fit_is_empty` tag, which can mean that `_fit` is never called for a given estimator, as well as estimators/object types that have no `fit` (such as distances)\r\n\r\nHere, 1. conflucts with 2. and with 3., but 2. and 3. do not conflict with each other (I think).\r\n\r\nI feel we need to think about potential ways to resolve this situation.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1798","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
