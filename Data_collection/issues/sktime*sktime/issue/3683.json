This is more a doubt than a bug.\r\nI need to implement outlier detection and replacement on a pipeline, and found the OptionalPassthrough transformer that would work perfect, because I need precisely to try if the transformation works fine or not and choose the best (like an hyperparameter to tune, wether to use or not the transformation), so far so good. But, my concern is about how it does the transformation in the test set. Typically, the normal way to to things, in order to avoid training with the same data we test, is Initialize the transformer, train and transform with the train set (train_set = Transformer.fit_transform(train_set)) and then use that transformer already trained to transform the test data (test_set = Transformer.transform(test_set)). How does it works with HampelFilter, or StandardScaler, or other transformers that needs the same behaviour?\r\nAnother question regarding the OptionalPassthrough transformer is if it can be used on an \"evaluate\" function of sktime, or only can be implemented on ForecastingGridSearchCV. If so, it would be nice to have that on the userguide and I can help on the guide.\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
