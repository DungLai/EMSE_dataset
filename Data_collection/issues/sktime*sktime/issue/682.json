Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMost of sklearn compatible `fit` methods are called using X, y order\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# sklearn and (most) sklearn compatible libraries such as imblearn - fit definition\r\ndef fit(Xt, yt, **fit_params):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n# call\r\nself._final_estimator.fit(Xt, yt, **fit_params)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `_final_estimator` is a sktime model, this causes an issue since the X and y arguments get reversed because sktime `fit` methods are called using y, X argument order (reverse of sklearn and sklearn compatible libraries).\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# sktime fit methods\r\ndef fit(self, y, X=None, fh=None, **fit_params)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if sktime argument order could be made consistent with sklearn and other sklearn compatible libraries by reversing the order of y and X arguments in fit.\r\n\r\ny could default to None and an internal check could be added in the base class to make sure that this to be present, else flag an error.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# sktime fit methods (proposed)\r\ndef fit(self, X=None, y=None, fh=None, **fit_params):\r\n    if y is None:\r\n        raise ValueError(\"y value was not provided\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI can not think of any.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCalling sktime models using `imblearn` pipeline which uses sklearn compatible calls [using X, y format](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn/blob/4162d2d8ef127a81238ee72ebabac55642daee7c/imblearn/pipeline.py#L281). This causes issues since sktime expects y to be the first argument, so X and y get flipped internally.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
