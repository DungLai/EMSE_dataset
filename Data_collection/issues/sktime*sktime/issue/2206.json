But when I run the snippet of code below, I clearly see the difference in results based on whether exogenous variables are passed or not. \r\n\r\nDoes the tag reflect the correct behavior?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import TransformedTargetForecaster, make_reduction\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\nfh=[1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nforecaster = make_reduction(estimator=LinearRegression(), scitype=\"tabular-regressor\", window_length=12, strategy=\"recursive\")\r\nprint(forecaster)\r\nprint(f\"Ignores X: {forecaster.get_tag('ignores-exogeneous-X')}\\n\\n\")\r\n\r\n#### With Exogenous ----\r\nforecaster.fit(y, X, fh=fh)\r\npreds = forecaster.predict(X=X[-4:])\r\nprint(f\"Predictions with Exogenous:\\n {preds}\\n\")\r\n\r\n#### Without Exogenous ----\r\nforecaster = make_reduction(estimator=LinearRegression(), scitype=\"tabular-regressor\", window_length=12, strategy=\"recursive\")\r\nforecaster.fit(y, fh=fh)\r\npreds = forecaster.predict()\r\nprint(f\"Predictions without Exogenous:\\n {preds}\\n\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/158032777-1325e773-6152-45d5-b3a8-f7983a33d4db.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would have expected the model to utilize exogenous variables appropriately as it is nothing but a regression model. So the behavior seems to be ok, but the tag seems to be incorrect.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.7.12 (default, Jan 15 2022, 18:48:18)  [GCC 7.5.0]\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\r\n   machine: Linux-5.4.144+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 21.1.3\r\n   setuptools: 57.4.0\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.2\r\n       sktime: 0.10.1\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.21.5\r\n        scipy: 1.4.1\r\n       pandas: 1.3.5\r\n   matplotlib: 3.2.2\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.55.1\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.5\r\n      tsfresh: None","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
