There should probably be a tag for this rather than turning them off manually for individual estimators. Addressed in PR #1195 which introduces the tag, and tests for either error raised, or correct return of pred intervals, depending on tag value.\r\n- [ ] `test_update_predict_predicted index` - in `update_predict`, formatting of the multi-cutoff thing is not implemented for data frame returns (or numpy) and will break in that case\r\n- [ ] `check_update_predict_predicted_index` does not just check index, but also checks that data frames have 2 columns or more (which is off-topic), so this needs to be removed and possibly replaced by output tests. #1193\r\n- [ ] `_format_moving_cutoff_predictions` breaks if given a list of data frames, which happens for a multivariate forecaster #1213\r\n\r\nThis was found by testing @GuzalBulatova's new multivariate column forecaster with the new framework.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
