The anomaly arises when running transformations testing locally. Strangely, this is not picked up with the repo tests. Differencer in transformations.series.difference return the same size data frame as input, which means for first order difference it returns nans in the first row\r\n \r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.difference import Differencer\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\r\n                   'b': [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],\r\n                   'c': [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]})\r\ndiff = Differencer()\r\nprint(df.diff())\r\n```\r\noutputs \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9594042/143411260-750b4921-f771-4737-aaa7-56d7c7a9be7c.png)\r\n Is it meant to have nans? If so, the tests need changing.
