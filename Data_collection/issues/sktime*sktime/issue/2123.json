It might be useful to invite contributions for a separate vignette/example on the advanced use cases of the evaluation class which could be linked to here? (parameter modification, custom metric composition, tuning over metric parameters)\r\n- Section 3.1. For me, it wasn't really clear what the other reduction strategies are, is this documented somewhere for further reading? \"In the above example we use the \"recursive\" reduction strategy. Other implemented strategies are..\"\r\n- Section 3.2. Is there a `normaliser` component for the pipelining? This could be useful for (e.g.) renewables forecasting where you have (user defined) changes in capacity of wind farm, region, solar park, etc\r\n- Section 3.4.1. Would it be more clear to include `seasonal=\"additive\"` in the exponential smoothing model to link with the examples shown previously? \r\n\r\nI made a few more minor changes to `01a_forecasting` and `01a_forecasting` in PR #2114 \r\n\r\nI hope this is useful!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2123/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
