Or will this mess up `sklearn` compatibility\r\n* can we create sth similar to `attrs` to `sklearn`-ify a spec?\r\n* can we create sth similar to `attrs` for `sktime` task specific base classes that minimizes boilerplate, e.g., standard docstrings, `__init__` structure, etc\r\n\r\nNot saying we should do sth like this, but I think the idea is quite compelling.
