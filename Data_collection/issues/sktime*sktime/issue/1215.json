Please describe.**\r\nI got the idea to add `sktime` as a package to `mlflow` like the following packages that are already included:\r\nhttps://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/index.html\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFot this we would have to contribute to `mlflow` ofc, but I thought anyway to open the issue here first as we might find here someone to work on it more likely maybe. We could also open an issue at `mlfow`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOutreach. We might also think of other packages where we could integrate `sktime` similarly to `mlflow`.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1215/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
