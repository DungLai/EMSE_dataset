On my system, the `load_UCR_UEA_dataset` utility is unable to find the file after downloading it\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nX_train, y_train = sktime.datasets.load_UCR_UEA_dataset(\"AbnormalHeartbeat\", split=\"train\", return_X_y=True)\r\n```\r\n```\r\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/williamgilpin/miniconda3/envs/dysts/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sktime/datasets/data/AbnormalHeartbeat/AbnormalHeartbeat_TRAIN.ts'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThis should import the data.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThere appear to be two issues here. First, if the data has not been downloaded before, `sktime` downloads an `.arff` file. However, the data loader utility looks for a `.ts` file. I tried manually downloading the UCR archive in `.ts` format, and then passing the location via the `extract_path` kwarg, but the path joins do not appear to be working---for example, if I pass a directory named `resources`, sktime will look for the file in `resources/resources`. \r\n\r\nI very much recognize that this could be an issue with how I have things installed and how my Python path is set up---I did try a fresh virtual environment, but that didn't solve the issue for me. However, if others can't reproduce this bug, then it probably is a quirk on my system---in which case I apologize for any inconvenience. Thanks again for this amazing package.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\nsktime-0.6.1\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"williamgilpin","id":8154246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTQyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8154246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin","html_url":"https://github.com/williamgilpin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamgilpin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
