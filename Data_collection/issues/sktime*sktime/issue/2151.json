Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRequesting a transformer to convert a non-stationary series to a stationary series. This would be helpful for VAR models which require stationarity as a prerequisite.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA transformer for differencing is already there, but to achieve stationarity, we may have to test for stationarity first and then apply differencing zero or more times appropriately. This transformer should orchestrate all this in a convenient wrapper.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nDoing this manually, but it is not convenient.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf possible, this should work for multiple series such that it can be applied to all outputs of a VAR model (multivariate).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2151/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
