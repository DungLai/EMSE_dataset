ARIMA `predict_interval` produces wider intervals for lower coverage level compared to the higher coverage level\r\n2. Quantile to alpha conversion seems to be inconsistent.\r\n3. AutoETS predictions do not match the 50% quantile from `predict_quantiles`\r\n4. Coverage to quantile conversion seems to be inconsistent.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nThe entire code can be found here: https://gist.github.com/ngupta23/ab7e003de06ae5b919937c31b2bad179 with snippets below\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import ARIMA\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster\r\ny = load_airline()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ARIMA \r\n```python\r\nforecaster = ARIMA(order=(1, 1, 0), seasonal_order=(0, 1, 0, 12))\r\nforecaster.fit(y, fh=[1,2,3])\r\n\r\nforecaster.predict(return_pred_int=True, alpha=0.05)\r\nforecaster.predict_quantiles(alpha=[0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.975])\r\nforecaster.predict_interval(coverage=[0.8, 0.9, 0.95])\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/159455224-202b4135-b20f-47ca-a8ac-88f4d1bbb018.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/159455256-2121c932-25fa-4657-a38e-820191d97239.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33585645/159455279-3729d87e-9ada-45bd-a2aa-0ee8b3af6fc8.png)\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n\r\n1. The 0.5 quantile from `predict_quantiles` matches with the forecast from `predict`. (Check pass)\r\n2. ARIMA `predict_interval` produces wider intervals for lower coverage levels compared to the higher coverage level (Seems like a bug).\r\n3. Intervals returned from `predict` with alpha = 0.05 seems to correspond to Quantiles = [0.025, 0.975] which is counter to this comment.
