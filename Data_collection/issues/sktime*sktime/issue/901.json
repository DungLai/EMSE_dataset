Also add the below information to be more explicit in the documentation.\r\n\r\nWhen building sktime’s documentation, the most common options for **`make`** are:\r\n\r\n- html: build any HTML output that hasn’t been built yet or needs to be rebuilt to include changes to the documentation source files.\r\n- clean: remove all previously built documentation output. All output files are generated from scratch on the next build.\r\n- serve: start a minimal web server and open a web browser to display the docs. Starting a server is necessary because large portions of the documentation require JavaScript files in the background.\r\n\r\nFor example, to clean the docs build directory, run the following command:\r\n\r\n`make clean`","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/901/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
