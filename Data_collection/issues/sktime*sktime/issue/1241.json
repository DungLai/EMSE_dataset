Please describe.**\r\nWhen using a forecaster with exog data and giving e.g. an `fh=[1,2,3]` but the `X` in `predict(fh=fh, X=X)` has a different length or index shape, then there is only a cryptic error like this:\r\n```\r\nValueError: X array dims (n_rows) != n_periods\r\n```\r\nBut it should tell the user what exactly was wrong.\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd \r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\n\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import AutoARIMA\r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\n# enlarge data to be used by arima model\r\ny = pd.concat([y]*5, ignore_index=True)\r\nX = pd.concat([X]*5, ignore_index=True)\r\n\r\ny_train, _, X_train, X_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, X)\r\nforecaster = AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True, sp=12)\r\nforecaster.fit(X=X_train,y=y_train)\r\nforecaster.predict(X=X_test, fh=[1,2,3])\r\n```\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdding this to e.g. `check_X` and `check_y_X` so that we can give also an `fh` and it will compare them and raise a more descriptive exception if they dont match together. We have to add it to `BaseForecaster` then.\r\n\r\nException message could be sth like:\r\n```\r\nGiven ForecastingHorizon and X in predict() must have same length and index values.\r\n```\r\n@dbart79 fyi","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
