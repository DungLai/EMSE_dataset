These have become more frequent recently.\r\n* community assets, communication and operations channels including GitHub accounts of developers, control of the repositories, and social channels Slack, Discord, twitter\r\n\r\nMotives for attackes can differ, e.g.:\r\n\r\n* criminal actors using `sktime` as a stepping stone for ransomware attacks via SSCA\r\n* nation state actors using `sktime` for SSCA, e.g., in the context of cyberattacks\r\n* community assets used as leverage in community internal social conflicts \r\n* community assets being seized as a supportive measure to enhance length, scope, or scale of an SSCA\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the key tools to mitigate any of the above risks are:\r\n\r\n* [separation of duties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_duties) - reducing the risk that a single actor can seize control of an entire process of all assets, by increasing the number of separate responsibilities or control points\r\n* [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) - reducing the risk of impersonation of elevated rights by a malicious actor by increasing the number of independent authentication points\r\n\r\nThis issue is also about discussing:\r\n\r\n* are there other key critical points that need to be covered by security architecture?\r\n* are there other measures than the above that we should consider?\r\n* what are the trade-offs, e.g., with operational efficiency\r\n* what is the best implementation of said measures?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3836/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
