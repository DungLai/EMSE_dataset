There is also a mostly empty section [\"user guide\"](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/user_guide), whose content largely duplicates [\"tutorials\"](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/tutorials.html).\r\n\r\nThe most important content actually already exists and would just need to be reshuffled.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following changes:\r\n- [x] merge \"tutorials\" and \"user guides\" into a single section. From \"user guides\", introduction can move over to \"introduction to sktime\", the rest is empty and can just go. Seems unnecessarily duplicative. First section of any major notebook currently is a tutorial anyway.\r\n- [x] ensure that the major tutorials in `examples`, i.e., those with a number at the start, are displayed in \"tutorials\". The sequence can be the same. Same for the appendices (start with letters).\r\n- [x] the lower quality, \"short\" notebooks which are \"demo of estimator X\" should go imo, or moved to the end. In `examples`, they just have random names. We either want all vignettes in there (currently only a minorty is linked).\r\n- [ ] there is some duplication of content in \"loading and working with data in sktime\", with the notebook \"datatypes and datasets\" https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/AA_datatypes_and_datasets.ipynb . This should be carefully looked at, outdated content (e.g., the implication that we still rely mainly on the nested data frame format; or the individual converter functions which were replaced by `convert` and `convert_to`) removed or replaced. There is some content in the older notebook which isn't in the newer one.\r\n\r\nSome new material would also be useful - this is existing functionality for `sktime` that's reflected only in interface specifications currently (see extension templates). In very subjective decreasing order of importance:\r\n- [ ] tutorial for transformers - work in progress: #1025, #1705 \r\n- [ ] tutorial for metrics\r\n- [x] tutorial on distances and kernels (addressed: now included with the transformers tutorial)\r\n- [ ] tutorial on alignment algorithms","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
