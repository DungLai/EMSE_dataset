Please describe.**\r\nRelated issue: #2083 , we need a test to avoid silent bugs like this.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nUse a mock forecaster/classifier/transformer to track if all args where given to it when using a composition. We could eiterh us `_X` and `_y` to read from it or compare the output, e.g. `predict()` of the mock forecaster should return a lower error if `X` is given. \r\n\r\nWe could start with forecasting module to create such a test, ideally automated for all compositions. \r\nWriting such tests would only make sense if they can be automated, otherwise if it needs to be added manually to the class that needs to be tested, there is no difference as it could also be forgotten, same as in #2083 .\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
