Outlier detection methods that use kernel density estimates generally employ a user defined parameter to determine the bandwidth. Lookout uses persistent homology to construct a bandwidth suitable for outlier detection without any user input. \r\n\r\nR code:\r\nhttps://github.com/sevvandi/lookout\r\n\r\nThe R implementation depends on some additional packages (which either need to have equivalent python counterparts, or the functions be re-written), specifically:\r\n- [ ] `phom <- TDAstats::calculate_homology(dist(X), format = \"distmat\")`\r\nhttps://rdrr.io/cran/TDAstats/src/R/calculate.R (R)\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-tda/ripser.py/blob/master/ripser/ripser.py (python)\r\n- [ ] `RANN::nn2(x, k = nn)$nn.dists`\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RANN/versions/2.6.1/topics/nn2 (R)\r\nshould be able to use sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors (python)\r\n- [ ]  `evd::fpot(log_dens, qq, std.err = FALSE) `\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/evd/versions/2.3-3/topics/fpot (R)\r\nhttps://github.com/iagolemos1/thresholdmodeling (python)\r\n^ new dependency, but most likely need to re-write as it's not been maintained\r\n- [ ] `evd::pgpd(-log(kdeobj$lookde), loc = qq,...` The Generalized Pareto Distribution\r\nhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.genpareto.html\r\n\r\nThe major uncertainty in the scope of this work is in `evd::fpot`, Maximum-likelihood fitting for peaks over threshold modelling, using the Generalized Pareto or Point Process representation.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nKandanaarachchi, Sevvandi, and Rob J.
