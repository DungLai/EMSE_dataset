While fixing #1079 noticed that when set to array fit does the job but predict fails, as it attempts to reuse the same `cap` and `floor` params. `predict` expects `cap` and `floor` to be same length as `fh` and thus will need to passed into `predict`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.fbprophet import Prophet\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\ny = y.to_timestamp(freq=\"M\")\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=36)\r\n\r\ny_train_df = pd.DataFrame(y_train)\r\ny_train_df.columns = [\"y\"]\r\ny_train_df[\"cap\"] = 1000\r\n\r\ncap = np.full_like(y_train_df[\"y\"], 1000)\r\n\r\nforecaster = Prophet(growth=\"logistic\", growth_cap=cap)\r\n\r\nforecaster.fit(y_train_df)\r\n\r\ny_pred = forecaster.predict([1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\ny_pred with valid values.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nonly fails if cap is array.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll continue looking into this.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
