Please describe.**\r\nWhen fitting a grid search with a pipeline in `sktime`, it can happen that the estimator or one of the transformers raises an exception for some combinations of the params. I personally faced this often when a transformer like box cox introduces negative values, but the following transformer/estimator can only use `>0` or `>=0 ` values. This is especially a problem when you want to apply an `optionalPassthrough` to the transformers.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFor this, in `sklearn` there is a param `error_score`:\r\n```error_score‘raise’ or numeric, default=np.nan\r\nValue to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting. If set to ‘raise’, the error is raised. If a numeric value is given, FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit step, which will always raise the error.`\r\n```\r\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html\r\n\r\nWe also should have this as it can be quite cumbersome in a bigger grid to not get any exception. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
