I just came to learn of it and have been absolutely blown away by the documentation and algorithms that are now accessible to people who aren't intimately familiar with this field..\r\n\r\nI have been diving through your documentation for a use case of mine where I have a data structure matching japanese_vowels dataset, i.e, multivariate time series unequal time series. After the initial learning curve getting your data into the expected format, I'm now in a trial and error phase to find the methods that are applicable for my usecase. \r\n\r\nI saw that most examples for multivariate time series used the motions data, so I've kind of just been trying to run those examples replacing them with the japanese vowels. Obviously, this is a time consuming process. I wonder if you had any suggestions  as to how to proceed. Are there plans to add some sort of tagging for method documentation so we know which methods (classifiers/transformers) are suitable for a given data type? \r\n\r\nSecondly, I understand that unequal time series is probably a more difficult usecase so I was wondering if I might not just try and pad the different time series using forward fills to get the more common equal time series use case. That might increase the options I have available for my use case. Since this is all quite new to me, I was thinking of using different transformations (PAA/SAX/Catch22, Matrix profile etc) and then find a way to featurize these for a couple of different pipeline setups: sklearn type as well as the sktime multivariate pipelines from the examples.\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1984/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
