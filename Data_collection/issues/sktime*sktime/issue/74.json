For now, I'm working around the problem by manually resetting the indices of all loaded `Series` after import.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked whether other means of loading the data also behave this way.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.utils.load_data import load_from_ucr_tsv_to_dataframe\r\nfrom sktime.classifiers.elastic_ensemble import ElasticEnsemble\r\n\r\nX_train, y_train = load_from_ucr_tsv_to_dataframe(\"GunPoint_TRAIN.tsv\")\r\n\r\n# what follows is the workaround\r\n#X_train = X_train.applymap(lambda series: series.reset_index(drop=True))\r\n\r\nelastic_ensemble = ElasticEnsemble()\r\nelastic_ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, `load_from_ucr_tsv_to_dataframe` should yield a `DataFrame` containing `Series` whose indices always start at 0.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nLinux-4.19.45-1-MANJARO-x86_64-with-arch-Manjaro-Linux\r\n\r\nPython 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)\r\n[GCC 7.3.0]\r\nNumPy 1.16.4\r\nSciPy 1.2.1\r\nsktime 0.2.0\r\n</details>","closed_by":{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
