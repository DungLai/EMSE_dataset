series classifiers should be refactored according to the [new extension template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/classification.py).\r\n\r\nIf you would like to work on this: *please post here* and which classifier you are taking on, to avoid duplication of work.\r\nA core dev will then add your name to the classifier under refactor and/or link the PR.\r\n\r\nChecklist of classifiers:\r\n\r\n- [x] `BaseColumnEnsembleClassifier`\r\n- [x] `ComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier`\r\n- [x] `BOSSEnsemble`, `IndividualBOSS` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1544\r\n- [x] `ContractableBOSS` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1295\r\n- [x] `MUSE` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1359\r\n- [x] `TemporalDictionaryEnsemble`, `IndividualTDE` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1357\r\n- [x] `WEASEL` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1544\r\n- [x] `MUSE` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1544\r\n- [x] `ElasticEnsemble` #1584\r\n- [x] `ProximityForest`, `ProximityStump`, `ProximityTree` #1584\r\n- [x] `ShapeDTW` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1554\r\n- [x] ~~`KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier`~~ (inherits from _KNeighborsClassifier and calls a version of self._fit in its current fit)\r\n- [x] `Catch22Classifier` #1487\r\n- [x] `MatrixProfileClassifier` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1545\r\n- [x] `SignatureClassifier` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1545\r\n- [x] `TSFreshClassifier` #1473 \r\n- [x] `HIVECOTEV1`  #1504\r\n- [x] `CanonicalIntervalForest` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1269\r\n- [x] `DrCIF` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1269\r\n- [x] ~~`TimeSeriesForestClassifier`~~ (bit complicated, involves the series_as_features base class)\r\n- [x] `RandomIntervalSpectralForest` #1583\r\n- [x] `SupervisedTimeSeriesForest` #1583\r\n- [x] `Arsenal` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1305\r\n- [x] `ROCKETClassifier` https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1239\r\n- [ ] ~~`MrSEQL`~~ (deprecated)\r\n- [x] `ShapeletTransformClassifier` #1490\r\n\r\nA general recipe for the refactor is as follows:\r\n\r\n* go through all the public methods, `fit`, `predict`, etc, and change them to the new private version `_fit`, `_predict`, etc\r\n* remove input checks (e.g., `check_X`) and output operations (e.g., set cutoff) from the private version; make sure these are already all present in the `BaseClassifier`.\r\n* if there's an input or output check/operation that looks like it should be in `BaseClassifier` but isn't, add a note to your PR and make it very explicit; consider adding it to `BaseClassifier` but make sure @TonyBagnall  and @fkiraly are aware of such a change (ping in PR and ask for review).\r\n* make sure all the tests pass. Don't change any of the tests. (unless there is a really good reason, in which case please explain)\r\n* if there's an inheritance tree (not just a single class) downstream from `BaseClassifier`, make sure you do the above for all nodes in the inheritance tree\r\n* move any \"properties\" or \"capabilities\" fields to the `_tags` dictionary.\r\n* If new tags are added, ensure they are added to the [tag registry](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/registry/_tags.py). Look up the classifier tags (using `registry.all_tags`) before you add any new ones. Ensure @TonyBagnall and @fkiraly are aware of changes to the tag registry (ping in PR and ask for review).","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
