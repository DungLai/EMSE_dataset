Should `update` or `fit` ever be called with an empty series `y`? That seems wrong, but I would have to untangle the rationale in `_predict_moving_cutoff` (which isn't properly documented).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
