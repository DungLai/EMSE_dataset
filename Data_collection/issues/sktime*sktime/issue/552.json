Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAs in real use cases we collect data to enlarge our training set, it would be useful to have an option on the `SlidingWindowSplitter` to have fixed start windows for the fold. For example for `window_length = 5`, `step_length = 1` and `fh = 3`\r\nhere is a representation of the folds:\r\n```\r\n|-----------------------|\r\n| * * * * * x x x - - - |\r\n| - * * * * * x x x - - |\r\n| - - * * * * * x x x - |\r\n| - - - * * * * * x x x |\r\n\r\n* = training fold.\r\nx = test fold.  \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could add the option to have the folds of the form:\r\n```\r\n|-----------------------|\r\n| * * * * * x x x - - - |\r\n| * * * * * * x x x - - |\r\n| * * * * * * * x x x - |\r\n| * * * * * * * * x x x |\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nJust add an option on the `SlidingWindowSplitter` class to keep `start_fixed`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWhen this parameter is set to `True` we compute the folds as \r\n```python\r\nend = self._get_end(y)\r\nstart = self._get_start()\r\n\r\nfor split_point in range(start, end, step_length):\r\n            training_window = np.arange(start, split_point)\r\n            test_window = split_point + fh - 1\r\n            yield training_window, test_window\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n See `fixedWndow` parameter from [Caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/data-splitting.html#data-splitting-for-time-series)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22996444/102721496-65f96600-42fb-11eb-9f67-fb4bc446592b.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/552/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
