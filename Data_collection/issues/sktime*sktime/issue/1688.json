Please describe.**\r\nThere is a simple naive forecasting possible by means of just copying values from the most recent season(s). Example for shampoo data can look as follows:\r\n```python\r\ny = load_shampoo_sales()\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=12)\r\ny_pred = y_train[-12:]\r\ny_pred.index = y_test.index\r\nplot_series(y_train, y_pred, y_test, labels=[\"y_train\", \"y_pred\", \"y_test\"])\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29627036/144651953-c62969b9-f498-4ea9-a4f1-fe2aaa989b8e.png)\r\n\r\nTogether with a `Detrender`, this might be a powerful naive forecast.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be important to take the first n points of the last season(s) for a forecast of n points. So it will not be just copying the last n points and take them as predictions. In above pic, if we would forecast only 4 steps, then we would take `y_pred = y_train[-12:-8]\r\n` instead `y_pred = y_train[-4:]`. Maybe we can also do both approaches an have a param for it to distinguish between them.","closed_by":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1688/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
