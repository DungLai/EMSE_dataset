the bug**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n-->\r\nAs discussed in PR https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1711: \r\nIf the series passed does have the` ds `column, the forecaster raises an error, which it shouldn't. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g.

what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nThe forecaster should not throw an error in this case\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1711, there were two approaches suggested to solve this issue:\r\nFirst by @fkiraly \r\n- write a functions df_to_prophet which takes X and does not have any side effects on it.\r\n- df_to_prophet moves index of X to ds column. If a ds column is already present, it renames it to a name that doesn't exist yet in the columns. For instance, the longest column name plus an underscore or similar.\r\n- the function is applied whenever X is passed.\r\n\r\nSecond approach would be not renaming the column. I am not sure how to handle the issue in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1712/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
