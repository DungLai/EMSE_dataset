Please describe.**\r\nSquare root transformations are often referenced as a potential transformation in forecasting, including in Practical TImeseries Analysis by Aileen Nielsen and in Rob Hyndman's forecasting packages in R. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThis can easily be implemented as a series-to-series transformer.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not include this functionality. Users could transform their series prior to use with a `sktime` forecaster. However, packages in other languages include the functionality and it is referenced by relevant texts so including it allows us maintain functionality that users may commonly expect.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
