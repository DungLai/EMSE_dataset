Please describe.**\r\nCurrently there are only two installation commands:\r\n- `pip install sktime`\r\n- `pip install sktime[all_extras]`\r\n\r\nWe dont have yet a separate install command for each individual soft-dependencies to do e.g. `pip install sktime[pmdarima]` or `pip install sktime[pmdarima,prophet]` and this causes an issue as sometimes people just run `pip install sktime` and then get a soft-dependency exception if trying to run code with a soft-dependency. Then they run e.g. `pip install pmdarima` but this might fetch a `pmdarima` version that is actually not compliant  with what is defined in the `pyproject.toml`. This can lead to unexpected exceptions and breaking code.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere are two possible solutions:\r\n1) We offer for each soft-dependency a command like `pip install sktime[pmdarima]` additionally to `pip install sktime[all_extras]`\r\n2) In the soft-dependency check `_check_soft_dependencies()` we fetch the version by `pmdarima.__version__` and compare it with what is in `pyproject.toml`. If this is not compliant, an exception is raised. We have to check if for all soft-dependencies the version can be fetched from `__version__`.\r\n\r\nPossibly we can just implement both solutions as for solution 1) users could still just do `pip install pmdarima` which can break code.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3833/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
