Please describe.**\r\nWhen preparing AR and ARIMA class models, it is helpful to be able to visually inspect segments of (univariate) time series through lag plots. Currently this feature doesn't exist within sktime but exists in other packages such as pandas\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA lag plotting function should be made available within sktime with compatibility with native representation of univariate time series (pandas Series object or columns of a pandas DataFrame). Output will be a (resizeable) lag plot. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Pandas api contains a lag plot function\r\n2. Stable R libraries have a lag plotting function\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nReferences on lag plots: \r\n* [Lag plot in R - Rob Hyndman's book](https://otexts.com/fpp2/lag-plots.html)\r\n* [Pandas lag plotting from Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.plotting.lag_plot.html)\r\n* [Lag plot described on NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/lagplot.htm) \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/588/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
