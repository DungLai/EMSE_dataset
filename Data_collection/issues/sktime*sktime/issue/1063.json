of our most requested/used time series classifiers is the pipeline of `tsfresh` feature extraction and then an `sklearn` classifier. \r\n- [x] There should be a shorthand `TsfreshClassifier` for that.\r\n\r\nWe should create a module with simple  \"feature extraction based\" TSC strategies like this, e.g., `feature_extr_based`.\r\n\r\nOther shorthands that would be great to have:\r\n- [ ]  `TabularizerClassifier`, using the tabluarizer; a bonus feature would be using its potential \"good first issue\" extension to be created, the binner #242\r\n- [x] `MatrixProfileClassifier` using the matrix profile\r\n- [x] `SignatureClassifier` - using signature - this already exists in @jambo6's work, so just needs to be moved into the same \"TSC type\" sub-folder\r\n- [ ] `SevenNumberClassifier` - using the seven-number-summary of the series (quartiles, mean, variance). A nice feature would be the ability to specify which of these to use, or more \"sample summaries\" like kurtosis or other percentiles; this should not use any sequential features, only features where the order does not matter.\r\n\r\nAll of these will have parameters: `estimator` - a `sklearn` classifier; and any parameters that come from the feature extractor, without additional nesting level (that you would get from `Pipeline`).","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
