This can probably be converted to use numba\r\n    b. weaasel and muse copy the differences into the attribute data in the wrong place (purely due to names used)\r\n\r\n2. Distance based:\r\n   a. EE has a predict with an extra argument, which does not match the interface \r\n   b. PF: still has to do list. Class definition not at the top of the file as with others.  \r\n   c. PF: Two forms of comment for parameters :paras: and Parameters \r\n   d. PF: code structure not the same, main class not at top.\r\n\r\n3. Interval based:\r\n   a.
