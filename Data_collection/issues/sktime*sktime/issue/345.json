Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the reduction meta-estimators only handle univariate data (we raise a not-implemented error [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/979aed585983fb820ddb0ca8a619d5730dbed4a7/sktime/forecasting/compose/_reduce.py#L67)). We need to extend it to support multivariate time series data. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n* Use temporal cross-validation iterator to transform multivariate time series into data frame with lagged values and vector with target values. Currently, the transformation happens [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/979aed585983fb820ddb0ca8a619d5730dbed4a7/sktime/forecasting/compose/_reduce.py#L73). \r\n* The `x_windows` list needs to be extended to contain the data from all series. \r\n* The different formatting of the windows for reduction to time series and tabular regression needs to be adapted too to handle multivariate data. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nLinked to #228 ","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/345/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
