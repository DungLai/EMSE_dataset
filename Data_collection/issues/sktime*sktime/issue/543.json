Great project and work that you all have been doing :)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTell us about the confusion introduced in the documentation.\r\n-->\r\nAs a new comer to using this package, I've been trying to figure out how to format the data that I have so that it can be used by all of the awesome methods that you guys have made. I've taken a look at [load data](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/examples/loading_data.ipynb) example where there is extensive writing about loading from a .ts file as well as how to use long format data with sktime. I've also looked at the other examples but they all have the data in it's correct format\r\n\r\nIt says the from_long_to_nested method converts rows from a long-table schema data frame _assuming_ each row contains information for `case_id, dimension_id, reading_id, value`. From my understanding (please correct me if i'm wrong) long format data should be in the format (cases, feature dim, time dim). For example, if I have 5 customers, 3 different columns for each one, and 6 time observations for each customer, the dimensions would 5 x 3 x 6. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we begin with this data format (I feel like this is a pretty common initial representation):\r\n\r\n| CustomerId      | date | feature1 | feature2 | feature3 | class\r\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |\r\n| 1      | 2010-10-15 | 1 | 2| 3| 'a'|\r\n| 1      | 2010-10-16 | 3 | 4| 5| 'b'|\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n| 2   | 2010-10-15 | 1 | 2| 3| 'c'|\r\n| 2      | 2010-10-16 | 3 | 4| 5|'d'|\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nHow do the above columns map to the `case_id, dimension_id, reading_id, value` representation?\r\nCustomerId -> case_id, correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTell us how we could improve the documentation in this regard.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCould there be an example that uses some concrete examples of the mapping?\r\n\r\nCould there also be an example that shows how to prepare this data for use by `from_long_to_nested`? \r\n\r\nEven better might be a method `df_to_long(case_id_identifier, feature_name_list, date_column_identifier)`  that converts a dataframe that is [tidy](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/DWE/book/6-2-tidy-data.html) to the required long format.\r\n\r\ncase_id_identifier would be the unique identifier (CustomerId in my case), feature_name_list an array of strings that identify the columns you want to use, and date_column_identifier a string that identifies the date column\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
