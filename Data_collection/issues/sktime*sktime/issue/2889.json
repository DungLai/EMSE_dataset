However, I can't get it to work for both ARIMA and AutoARIMA. Is there an inherent difference between ARIMA forecasters and others? Do I have to call or wrap them differently or is ConformalPrediction not possible with ARIMA?\r\nWith other forecasters I have no issues.\r\n\r\nThis is the error I get:\r\nFile \"...\\site-packages\\statsmodels\\tsa\\statespace\\sarimax.py\", line 843, in _conditional_sum_squares\r\n    Y = endog[r:]\r\nIndexError: too many indices for array: array is 0-dimensional, but 1 were indexed\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import AutoARIMA, ARIMA\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.conformal import ConformalIntervals\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\ntrial_forecaster = AutoARIMA()\r\nconformal_forecaster = ConformalIntervals(trial_forecaster, method=\"conformal\")\r\nconformal_forecaster.fit(y, fh=[1,2,3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated! </div>","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
