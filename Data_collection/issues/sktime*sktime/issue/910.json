This is due to the `float` conversion happening in `__init__`, which is against what sklearn expects during cloning - it expects that all of the values passed as arguments to `__init__` will not be modified in any way when being set as object attributes.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.fbprophet import Prophet\r\nfrom sklearn.base import clone\r\nmodel = Prophet()\r\nmodel.set_params(changepoint_prior_scale=1)\r\nclone(model)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will raise a sklearn `RuntimeError`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo exception is raised.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 07:30:14)  [GCC 7.3.0]\r\nexecutable: /home/baum/anaconda3/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-5.11.0-7614-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.10\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 20.2.4\r\n   setuptools: 50.3.1.post20201107\r\n      sklearn: 0.23.2\r\n       sktime: 0.5.3\r\n  statsmodels: 0.12.2\r\n        numpy: 1.20.1\r\n        scipy: 1.6.1\r\n       Cython: 0.29.17\r\n       pandas: 1.2.3\r\n   matplotlib: 3.4.1\r\n       joblib: 1.0.1\r\n        numba: 0.51.2\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.0\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
