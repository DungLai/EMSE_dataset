This would require us to check python 3.11 support for soft dependencies periodically and potentially remove the condition at a later point in time.\r\n* `numba` could be solved by \"wait for python 3.11 support\". When that happens is unclear.\r\n* or, we can turn `numba` into a soft dependency right now, and deal with it as with the other soft dependencies. This is entirely feasible - the PR here could be merged and enable python 3.11 https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3856. But, it is a very contentious issue with some core developers.\r\n* a third option keeps `numba` as core dependency, but makes it optional *only on python 3.11*, until it becomes compatible. This option is implemented here, ready for merge and enable: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/4000. As it turns out, this is also very contentious.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
