Ensure content is clean, well-documented, and interface compliant.\r\n* content could also move to different repositories.\r\n\r\nFYI @TonyBagnall, what is all this?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@TonyBagnall's re-post, here, 4h later:\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nfrom the beginning, contrib and _contrib have been areas where working code could be stored, particularly by the UEA group. This was a convenient solution proposed by the developers at the time. However, sktime is now at a stage where it looks odd having this code there. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRemove _contrib, ship any useful code to subpackages\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues to resolve before we do this, so please dont just delete it. The main of these are\r\n\r\n1. Where to put the rotation forest and the continue interval tree classifiers. These are standard vector classifiers, not time series classifiers, used  within time series classifiers. I think we should just locate them within the file containing the time series classifier of interest.\r\n\r\n2. clustering_experiments and classification_experiments are central to how we run experiments. These are moving to an sktime-estimator-evaluation sub package (still private at the moment). \r\n\r\n3. Also need to review other content, and see what is salvagable\r\n\r\nMy goal is to have this done by the time the grant starts. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
