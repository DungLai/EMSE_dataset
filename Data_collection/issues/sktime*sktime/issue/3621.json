But multivariate forecasting models such as VAR assume that all columns are passed.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.compose import EnsembleForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.exp_smoothing import ExponentialSmoothing\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.var import VAR\r\n\r\n# load data\r\n_, y = load_longley()\r\n\r\n# run ensembler\r\nforecaster = EnsembleForecaster(\r\n    forecasters=[(\"var1\", VAR()), (\"var2\", VAR())],\r\n    aggfunc=\"mean\"\r\n)\r\nforecaster.fit(y)\r\nforecaster.predict(fh=[1,2,3])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe ensemble forecaster should ensemble all models without any failure.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n```raw\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.9 (default, Oct 16 2021, 12:00:06)  [Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)]\r\nexecutable: /Users/anhoang/Scratchpad/.venv/bin/python\r\n   machine: macOS-12.5.1-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 22.3\r\n   setuptools: 49.2.1\r\n      sklearn: 1.1.2\r\n       sktime: 0.13.4\r\n  statsmodels: 0.13.2\r\n        numpy: 1.22.4\r\n        scipy: 1.8.1\r\n       pandas: 1.5.1\r\n   matplotlib: None\r\n       joblib: 1.2.0\r\n        numba: 0.56.3\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
