Please describe.**\r\nReviewing a plot of a series, as well as its ACF and PACF functions is a common exploratory data analysis step in time series analysis. \r\n\r\nCurrently users would have to individually plot the series using sktime's `plot_series` function and then either import and use statsmodels' `plot_acf `and `plot_pacf` functions. Providing an off-the-shelf method to easily generate a nice looking figure containing all three plots would make basic time series exploratory analysis easier for users.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen, ideally taking into consideration the existing toolbox design, classes and methods. \r\n\r\nCreation of a convenience function `plot_correlations` to generate a plot of a time series and its ACF and PACF. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\nAlternative is to have users continue to use separate functionality from sktime's `plot_series` and statsmodels' `plot_acf `and `plot_pacf`  functions. But this is more cumbersome for users performing a routine exploratory data analysis task. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/817/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/817/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
