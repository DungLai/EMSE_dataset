Please describe.**\r\nI and @koralturkk would like to add a wrapper for forecasting with [BSTS](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/sts)\r\nExamples are given [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Structural_Time_Series_Modeling_Case_Studies_Atmospheric_CO2_and_Electricity_Demand#model_and_fitting).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n**Idea 1)**\r\nWrapping each possible [module](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/sts) via an argument of type `list` containing one or several `dict`.\r\nFor example: \r\n```python\r\ntfp.sts.DynamicLinearRegression(\r\n    design_matrix, drift_scale_prior=None, initial_weights_prior=None,\r\n    observed_time_series=None, name=None\r\n)\r\n```\r\n ...would become \r\n```python\r\nadd_DynamicLinearRegression = [{\r\n\"design_matrix\" = design_matrix,\r\n\"drift_scale_prior\"=None, \"initial_weights_prior\"=None,\r\n    \"observed_time_series\"=None, \"name\"=None}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this is also the way I was wrapping in `fbprophet` with `add_seasonality()` e.g.\r\n\r\n**Idea 2)**\r\nAllowing that the user creates the modules outside `sktime` so that it can be passed as a `tfp.sts` class:\r\n```python\r\nimport tensorflow_probability as tfp\r\ndlr = tfp.sts.DynamicLinearRegression(\r\n    design_matrix, drift_scale_prior=None, initial_weights_prior=None,\r\n    observed_time_series=None, name=None\r\n)\r\n```\r\nWe would need `**kwargs` for it to pass `dlr` in `sktime.BSTS(dlr)`\r\n\r\nLooking forward for your feedback @mloning ","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
