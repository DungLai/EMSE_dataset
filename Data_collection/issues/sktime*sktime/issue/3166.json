In theory, this could end in infinite recursion, but it seems it does not, and `all_estimators` returns the correct answer.\r\nStill, a call to `all_estimators` takes very long, indicating that still sth might be going on.\r\n\r\nNow, when I try to refactor to `all_objects`, the expected infinite recursion *does* happen.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* why does it not happen in the status quo, but only after refactor?\r\n* how to avoid it in a principled way? Excluding `\"all\"` in the argument does not prevent `pkgutil.walk_packages` to load the package, i.e., does not prevent the recursion. There is also no option in `walk_packages` to exclude modules by name.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
