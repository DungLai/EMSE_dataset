Updated after discussion below.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the `SFA` does not comply with any `sktime` transformer interface, because `transform` returns a list of dictionaries.\r\n\r\nBased on discussion with @MatthewMiddlehurst, @patrickzib (below and on slack), the list of dict can be read as a table, with list index = row index and key = col index, so it is formally/scientifically a transformer.\r\n\r\nThe non-compliance comes through `sktime` currently not supporting list of dict as a table format.\r\nTwo options would exist in-principle: always convert to a compliant output format (i.e., modify SFA), or introduce list of dict as a compliant format (i.e., modify the datatypes module).\r\n\r\nWe've reached the conclusion that we should do the second, i.e., that it should be added, since conversions to `pd.DataFrame` etc greately reduce performance of composites, namely classifiers that use the SFA transformer.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
