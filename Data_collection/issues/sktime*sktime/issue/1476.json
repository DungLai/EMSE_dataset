Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\n\r\n`sktime` currently has a variety of forecasting error metrics (where a lower value is better). Adding support for common \"score\" metrics (where a higher value is better) would be nice to round out our forecasting performance metrics. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe can provide a sktime compatiable interface to scikit-learn's implementation of a couple common \"score\" metrics. The metrics that make the most sense to me for use in evaluating forecasting models are:\r\n\r\n- [explained_variance_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score.html#sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score)\r\n- [r2_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html#sklearn.metrics.r2_score)\r\n\r\nAdding these should be relatively straight-forward. The first step is to implement a function for each in `sktime.performance_metrics.forecasting._functions.py` and the contributor can generally follow along with what is done for `mean_absolute_error` in that file. \r\n\r\nThen there needs to be the class versions of the metrics in implemented in `sktime.performance_metrics.forecasting._classes.py`. Both metrics can inherit from `_BaseForecastingScoreMetric` and just need to define `__init__` appropriately (see `MeanAbsoluteError` as a guide).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nPrimary alternative is not adding the metrics. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe need to provide an interface, instead of just using the scikit-learn versions, to ensure that they fit with sktime's forecasting performance metric interface (need to optionally accept y_train without throwing an error).\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
