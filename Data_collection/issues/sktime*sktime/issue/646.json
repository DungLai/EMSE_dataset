Please describe.**\r\nDistance measures are currently not tested, both python or cython implementations. This leads to bugs like #645 and #596 \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFor every distance measure, a corresponding unit test should be made to check known inputs against known outputs. This will a) test whether the distance measures are working properly and b) run checks in travis ensuring any new development does not silently break / alter the distance measure code / behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNo alternatives afaik.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis will help with any classifier which uses distance measures, as if the distance measure pass all tests but your classifier does not you know the problem lies in your classifier rather than the distance measures. Likewise, the reverse is true if a problem lies in a distance measure instead of your classifier.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
