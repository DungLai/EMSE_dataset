Please describe.**\r\nInclude MultiRocket (https://github.com/ChangWeiTan/MultiRocket) as a classification algorithm. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMultiRocket can be integrated analogously to Rocket or MiniRocket. In my test data sets, the algorithm showed very good results. I have already redesigned the code of @ChangWeiTan accordingly so that there is a transformer and a classifier analogously to Rocket. @ChangWeiTan could possibly say whether integration in sktime is also in his sense. After that, I would upload the code accordingly as a pull request. Since I'm not familiar with the licenses, I don't know if I can just use the code.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1558/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
