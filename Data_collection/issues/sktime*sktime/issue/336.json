Please describe.**\r\n\r\nBootstrapping time series can be a good approach to generate confidence intervals. Following [Forecasting: Principles and Practice, Ch 11.4](https://otexts.com/fpp2/bootstrap.html):\r\n\r\n> There are at least four sources of uncertainty in forecasting using time series models:\r\n\r\n> 1. The random error term;\r\n> 2. The parameter estimates;\r\n> 3. The choice of model for the historical data;\r\n> 4. The continuation of the historical data generating process into the future.\r\n> When we produce prediction intervals for time series models, we generally only take into account the first of these sources of uncertainty. Even if we ignore the model uncertainty and the uncertainty due to changing data generating processes (sources 3 and 4), and we just try to allow for parameter uncertainty as well as the random error term (sources 1 and 2), there are no algebraic solutions apart from some simple special cases.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- Obtain confidence intervals for many possible bootstrap methods as part of the forecasting pipeline. \r\n- Use bagging to generate forecasts by combining individual predictions from bootstrap samples. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIntegration with existing packages like [arch](https://arch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), in particular with the [Time-series Bootstraps](https://arch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bootstrap/timeseries-bootstraps.html). \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nHere are some useful resources:\r\n-  [Forecasting: Principles and Practice, Ch 11.4](https://otexts.com/fpp2/bootstrap.html)\r\n- [arch](https://arch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package.\r\n- [Blog Post: Bootstrapping time series for improving forecasting accuracy](https://petolau.github.io/Bootstrapping-time-series-for-improving-forecasting-in-R/)","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/336/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
