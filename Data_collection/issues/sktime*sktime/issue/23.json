Classifying multivariate data (independent vs dependent). \r\n\r\nPoint 1 is obviously fundamental. To summarise, this is how I see the differences, I have done a minimal sci-kit learn implementation where the intervals and summary stats are hard coded, but the base classifier is configurable through the constructor. Marcus has implemented it with an internal Pipeline, where the transforms are externally configurable through the constructor, but the classifier is hard coded. I have inherited from RandomForest directly, whereas Marcus has cloned and adapted the base classifiers and the ensembles. \r\n\r\nMy reasoning is that, whilst a generic configurable TSClassifier with a pipeline is desirable,  it should be the base classifier. If we implement a classifier called TSF that directly refers to a paper that describes the algorithm, then we should match the paper description. With a general purpose pipeline, users could build a classifier that is called TSF but is in fact something completely different. I also think transformers may be an over design for this very simple algorithm, and I would like to test what overhead (if any) they introduce.  \r\n\r\nObviously, I prefer mine :) I am of course more than happy to discuss and to go the other way if that is the consensus.
