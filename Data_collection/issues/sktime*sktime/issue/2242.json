Perhaps not all OS-version are necessary to be tested, but we probably should test the \"oldest\" combination of packages we are claiming support for?\r\n\r\nFYI @lmmentel, @freddyaboulton ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
