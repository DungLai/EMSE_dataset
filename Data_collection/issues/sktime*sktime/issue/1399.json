Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the `NaiveForecaster` can only handle univariate input data. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe are working on a quick fix to extend it to multivariate data using the `ColumnForecasterEnsemble` (see discussion in our [meetup notes](https://github.com/sktime/community-org/blob/main/meetups/previous_meetings/20210909-meetup.md#applying-univariate-forecasters-to-multivariate-data)). But it would be nice to re-write the implementation in `_fit` and `_predict` to handle both univariate and multivariate data internally making use of the shared API of `pd.Series` and `pd.DataFrame` objects.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
