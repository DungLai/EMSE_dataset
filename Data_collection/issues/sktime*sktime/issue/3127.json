Unrelated to this.\r\n* a [convolution kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)), as commonly used in signal and image processing\r\n* an [integral kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_kernel), which is related to both RKHS kernels and convolution kernels\r\n\r\nThe subtle thing is: Rocket uses *convolution* kernels but not RKHS kernels, i.e., it does not use evaluates of kernel functions as would be characteristic for \"kernel methods\" in that sense.\r\n\r\nWhereas, ML users would typically expect to be able to specify the kernel function in a \"kernel based method\".\r\n\r\nI hence propose to rename the category from the ambiguous (and potentially misleading) \"kernel based\" category to \"convolution based\", and reserve the category \"kernel based\" to methods that take RKHS kernels as hyper-parameters.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
