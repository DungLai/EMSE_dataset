Please describe.**\r\nIn some cases where models are very slow, you may wish to refresh a model with new data without refitting its' parameters. I thought this would be achieved by calling `update` with `update_params = False` however currently this seems to not impact model predictions at all. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA method for adding new data to models that can change predictions without refitting model parameters. For example an AR(1) model where $y_{t} = a + b y_{t-1}$ you initially fit to find $a$ and $b$. Currently there is no way to change $y_{t-1}$ without refitting the model. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nTried using `update_params=False` in `update` and `UpdateEvery`/`UpdateRefitsEvery` but cannot get it to replicate this behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\nRunning this code obtains same prediction before and after updating the AR(1) model.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import ARIMA\r\n\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nmod = ARIMA()\r\nmod.fit(y.iloc[0:12])\r\nprint(mod.predict(fh=1))\r\nmod.update(y.iloc[12:13], update_params=False)\r\nprint(mod.predict(fh=1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3496/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
