Please describe.**\r\nThe `HampelFilter` was included in the transformation module prior to the addition of the annotation module. It is used to detect outliers, which is an annotation task. \r\n\r\nI've talked with @aiwalter who added it, and we both think it should be moved to the annotation module in the long-run. But we don't want to move it without being able to still use it (and other annotators) in a `ForecastingPipeline`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHampelFilter should be moved to the annotation module and refactored to comply with that interface. This should be done in conjunction with completion of #840, which will add a `ConditionalImputer` transformer that will allow annotators to be used\r\nin a `ForecastingPipeline`. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative of leaving the `HampelFilter` in the transformation module is not ideal in the long-run because then we have estimators for the same task (detecting outliers) in more than one module.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
