I do not believe that it is possible at the moment to use a KernelPCA, specifically with the dynamic time warping based Global Alignment Kernel (which is used, for instance, in sktime's TimeSeriesSVC). It would be interesting and probably useful to have this included in sktime, and because of the existing implementation of the kernel, I do not think that it would be that difficult to add (perhaps it is already available?).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
