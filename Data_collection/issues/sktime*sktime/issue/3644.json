I am also running under the assumption that y as in the time series data we are trying to model is meant to be passed first to the function and all exogenous inputs afterward (like it is used in the [check_y_X function]).(https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/sktime/utils/validation/forecasting.py)). However the logic in the function seems to be reversed.\r\n\r\nShouldn't the line `failure_cond = not y_index.isin(first_index).all()` be switched to `failure_cond = not first_index.isin(y_index).all()`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe following code is erroneously accepted (no error raised). Here X is a subset of y and thus should fail.\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.utils.validation.series import check_equal_time_index\r\n\r\ny = pd.DataFrame(data={'a':[1,1]}, index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2005-01-01', '2005-01-02']))\r\nX = pd.DataFrame(data={'a':[1]}, index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2005-01-01']))\r\n\r\ncheck_equal_time_index(y,X, mode='contains')\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere X is a superset of y but it throws an error when it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n```\r\ny = pd.DataFrame(data={'a':[1]}, index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2005-01-01']))\r\nX = pd.DataFrame(data={'a':[1,1]}, index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2005-01-01','2005-01-02']))\r\n\r\ncheck_equal_time_index(y,X, mode='contains')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, the fix should be just that line I mentioned.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
