So far, scikit-learn has the MAPE. This measure has some serious shortcomings, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error#Issues). If you are interested in this topic, the following could be good additions:\r\n\r\n## Mean directional accuracy\r\nI think this one is especially interesting when you only want to predict the direction of your time series correctly. Up or down nothing else. A classic problem to apply this is when dealing with the prediction of stock prices. I don't really care if my model can tell me if the stock price rises by 10% or 20%, it's important that it rises. And the model won't output accurate percentages anyway. It makes it potentially easier to design a well-performing model according to this metric.\r\n\r\n## Logarithm of the accuracy ratio\r\n[Here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2635088), the author explains why it is a good measure. What I like about this measure: Usually, the MAPE punishes over and underestimating differently. If the actual value A is 2 and the forecast F is 1, the APE here is 0.5. If A=2 and F=4, the APE is 1. Two different scores, although the prediction is half or double the actual value, and I would like these errors to be the same. The Logarithm of the accuracy ratio does exactly that (0.48 in both cases). (By the way, the Mean directional accuracy does this, too.)\r\n\r\nAnother nice property is that the best constant prediction for some label vector y is the geometric mean of y. This is analog to the mean, which is the best constant prediction for the MSE metric, or the median for the MAD metric.\r\n\r\n[You can find my implementations here.](https://github.com/Garve/scikit-bonus/blob/master/skbonus/metrics/_regression.py)\r\n\r\nIf you like, I can do a pull request.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRobert","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
