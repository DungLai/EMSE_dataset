issue is to create a wishlist of interval forecasters and probabilistic forecasters.\r\nAnyone can add wishes here, in the end we prettify and move to the forecasting wishlist.\r\n\r\nInterval forecasters have `predict_quantile` or `predict_interval`.\r\n(or `predict_var` but that's more variance forecaster)\r\n\r\nProbabilistic forecasters will have `predict_proba`, i.e., predict full distributions.\r\n\r\nWe should also include compositors, especially those converting point foreceasters into interval or probabilistic forecasters.\r\n\r\nInspiration can be the M5 competition, but we should also make sure we have \"simple baselines\" such as \"constant variance = back-test aggregate variance\" etc.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
