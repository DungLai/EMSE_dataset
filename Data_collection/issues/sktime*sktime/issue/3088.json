Please describe.**\r\nA very useful approach to time series forecasting using machine learning is the Direct Multioutput (DIRMO) approach. Its relevance is explained in a highly cited article: \"The DIRMO strategy aims to preserve the most appealing aspects of DIRect and MIMO strategies by partitioning the horizon H in several blocks, and using MIMO to forecast the values inside each block.\" The model \"provides a beneficial trade off between the preserving a larger degree of the stochastic dependency between future values and having a greater flexibility of the predictor.\"\r\n\r\nSource: Bontempi, Gianluca, Souhaib Ben Taieb, and Yann-AÃ«l Le Borgne. \"Machine learning strategies for time series forecasting.\" European business intelligence summer school. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2012.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA standard implementation of the DIRMO strategy in make_reduction, which would require additional arguments to define the blocks of the forecasting horizon to be forecasted.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nManually creating this forecasting strategy from the components already in sktime. This leads to a lot of boilerplate code.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe DIRMO strategy is mentioned in the same paper that is given as a reference in the documentation of sktime for the Recurive, Direct, Dirrec and Multioutput strategies.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
