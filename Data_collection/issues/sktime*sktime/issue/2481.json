Please describe.**\r\nTime Warp Edit (TWE) distance is a time series distance measure published in PAMI some time ago\r\n\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0703/0703033.pdf\r\n\r\nfor some reason, it has its own wiki page\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warp_Edit_Distance\r\n\r\nIt is not currently implemented in the distances module in sktime, and it would be good to have it. If someone does this, there could be the option to collaborate on its evaluation for multivariate time series classification and clustering, which may lead to a publication.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOne of the reasons it is not currently in sktime is because there was some question about the original authors implementation, but Im not sure if it was resolved, if anyone does remember, please post here. \r\nThe original c version is here\r\nhttps://github.com/pfmarteau/TWED/blob/main/TWED_c/TWED.c\r\n\r\nWe have two versions in our Java repo tsml, although the structure of distances over there is a bit of a mess.\r\nhttps://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/blob/master/src/main/java/tsml/classifiers/legacy/elastic_ensemble/distance_functions/TWEDistance.java\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/blob/master/src/main/java/tsml/classifiers/distance_based/distances/twed/TWEDistance.java\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNote that the implementation must be in numba, for which the C implementation would be useful. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
