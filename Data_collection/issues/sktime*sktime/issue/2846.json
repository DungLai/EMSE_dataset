I guess it is because, `y_pred` doesn't have `y_true` ' s column name in its name. It is somehow removed during inner convertion processes. \r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_longley\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.arima import ARIMA\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_evaluation import evaluate\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import ExpandingWindowSplitter\r\n\r\ny, X = load_longley()\r\n\r\nfh = np.arange(1,3)\r\n\r\nmodel = ARIMA()\r\n\r\ndf = evaluate(\r\n    forecaster=model,\r\n    cv=ExpandingWindowSplitter(fh=fh),\r\n    y=y,\r\n    X=X,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nNo warning should be given\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\nSystem:\r\npython: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 06:04:18)  [GCC 10.3.0]\r\nexecutable: /miniconda3/envs/predy-ts/bin/python3.8\r\nmachine: Linux-5.13.0-51-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.10\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\npip: 22.1.2\r\nsetuptools: 62.3.4\r\nsklearn: 1.0\r\nsktime: 0.12.0\r\nstatsmodels: 0.13.2\r\nnumpy: 1.21.6\r\nscipy: 1.8.1\r\npandas: 1.3.5\r\nmatplotlib: 3.5.2\r\njoblib: 1.1.0\r\nnumba: 0.55.2\r\npmdarima: 1.8.5\r\ntsfresh: None\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
