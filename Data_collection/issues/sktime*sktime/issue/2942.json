If taking, please say which of the sub-tasks you would like to work on.\r\n\r\nSuggested actions:\r\n\r\n- [ ] `clustering` - plotting functionality for clustering. Move to `sktime.clustering` module.\r\n- [ ] `datasets` - duplication of `sktime.datasets`. https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3518\r\n- [ ] `diagram_code` - critical difference diagrams. https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3519\r\n- [ ] `distance_based` looks like a time series classifier. Move to `classification`.\r\n- [ ] `windows_installation` - install instructions. Move to docs, sub-page of install instructions.\r\n- [ ] `_classification_test_reproduction` - tests, should move to `TestAllClassifiers` or `TestAllEarlyClassifiers`, duplications removed\r\n- [ ] `_plot_path` - plotting functionality for alignment. Move to `sktime.alignment` module.\r\n- [ ] `classifier_capabilities_table` - could go in the docs, next to the estimator table\r\n- [ ] `set_classifier`, `set_clusterer`. Not sure why needed, but if needed should be refactored so there is not a million if/else but refs are by class name string. Parameter settings could to into `get_test_params`.\r\n- [x] `ShapeletTransform` - transformer, move to `sktime.transformations`","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
