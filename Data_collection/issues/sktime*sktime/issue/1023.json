discussion in #839 , which was originally about *transformers*, not *annotators*.\r\n\r\nStream annotators can naturally be used as transformers.\r\n\r\nSo, my question:\r\n\r\nshould we give them a `transform` interface point too, which just loops to `predict`?\r\n\r\nWe could adopt the convention even that `transform` naturally produces the `dense` representation (same indices as the transformed series), while `predict` produces the `sparse` representation (e.g., only indices of annotations).\r\n\r\nOr, we could adopt the convention that this is 1:1 the same and return type is controlled via constructor.\r\n\r\nPinging @satya-pattnaik, @mloning - what do you think?\r\n\r\nEspecially since @satya-pattnaik's original design had `transform`, not `predict`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1023/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
