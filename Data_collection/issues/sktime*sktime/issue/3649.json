It is well-documented that uniform scaling works better for these kinds of problems (Keogh 2005 - https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/b13634.pdf), so I was surprised to find that there is no implementation of this in sktime. Would love to see this implemented here.\r\n\r\nIf I've missed an implementation of this in the documentation, apologies. (also open to any suggestions on how to do this manually)\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
