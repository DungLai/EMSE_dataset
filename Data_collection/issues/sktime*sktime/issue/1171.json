In fact, all the series must not be equal! So it needs to fail as early as in the first iteration.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.5 (default, Sep  3 2020, 21:29:08) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nexecutable: C:\\Users\\off99\\anaconda3\\python.exe\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.19041-SP0\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 20.2.4\r\n   setuptools: 52.0.0.post20210125\r\n      sklearn: 0.24.1\r\n       sktime: 0.7.0\r\n  statsmodels: 0.12.2\r\n        numpy: 1.19.5\r\n        scipy: 1.6.2\r\n       Cython: 0.29.23\r\n       pandas: 1.2.4\r\n   matplotlib: 3.3.4\r\n       joblib: 1.0.1\r\n        numba: 0.51.2\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
