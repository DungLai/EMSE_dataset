Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, `ForecastingGridSearchCV` can only return `best_forecaster_`, however I would like to also get best `n` forecasters in order to create an `EnsembleForecaster` with them. Ensembling would probably especially work well in combination with using `MultiplexForecaster` to find the models which to use inside the ensemble.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe could add a param like `return_n_forecaster=1` and if `>1` we could return a list `best_n_forecasters_`. The information of best `n` forecaster can be easily extracted from `results`, like done here for `best_forecaster_`:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/7343dc36566935b42167878c45d570099af96dab/sktime/forecasting/model_selection/_tune.py#L292-L296\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI could write a custom function to get this forecasters without contributing it to `sktime`. However I would need to be able to access `results` which is a `pd.DataFrame`.\r\n___\r\nMartin Walter <martin_friedrich.walter@daimler.com>, Mercedes-Benz AG on behalf of Daimler TSS GmbH.\r\nhttps://github.com/Daimler/daimler-foss/blob/master/LEGAL_IMPRINT.md\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
