And, a high risk that secondary locations go out of sync.\r\n\r\nThere should, instead, be a single interface point that those estimators can refer to, so there is a single point of change and a single point of truth.\r\n\r\nExisting secondary references should be updated to refer to that single point of truth instead. References can be found by searching for one of the distance strings such as `\"lcss\"`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
