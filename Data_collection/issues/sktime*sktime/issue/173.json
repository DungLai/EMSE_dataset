This does not change behaviour for if the estimators are deterministic but might do so if they include a stochastic element and might blow up the object if called multiple times. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sktime.forecasters import ExpSmoothingForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasters import EnsembleForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_shampoo_sales\r\n\r\nshampoo = load_shampoo_sales()\r\ntrain = pd.Series([shampoo.iloc[0].iloc[:30]])\r\n\r\nestimator = [('ses', ExpSmoothingForecaster())]\r\nm = EnsembleForecaster(estimators=estimator)\r\n\r\nm.fit(train, fh=1)\r\nprint(len(m.fitted_estimators_)) # Result: 1\r\nm.fit(train, fh=1)\r\nprint(len(m.fitted_estimators_)) # Result: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nClear previous fits whenever the fit method is called.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nWindows-10-10.0.17763-SP0\r\nPython 3.7.4 (tags/v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 20:34:20) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nNumPy 1.17.2\r\nSciPy 1.3.1\r\nsktime 0.3.0\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
