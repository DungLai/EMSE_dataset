A full refit - as of now - should remain the default.\r\n\r\nThe `AutoARIMA` class in the `pmdarima` package does have such an `update` method, which would in turn need to be referenced in the `sktime` wrapper. As far as I can tell this would require adding a `_update` method to the `_PmdArimaAdapter` class. As discussed with @fkiraly `update_pdq: boolean` should control re-fit/update.
