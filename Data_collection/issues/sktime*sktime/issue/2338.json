Please describe.**\r\n\r\nStarting from version 22.3.20 of `flake8-bugbear` (https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/releases/tag/22.3.20) `@lru_cache` decorator in `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon.to_relative` and `sktime.forecasting.base._fh.ForecastingHorizon.to_absolute` raises a pre-commit error. Adding `# noqa: B019` silences the warning, but I do not think this is a very sustainable solution.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIs `@lru_cache` strictly necessary? Is the speed gain so dramatic that it overweights the dangers suggested by flake8? I do not have much experience with caching, so I have no good solution to propose.","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2338/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
