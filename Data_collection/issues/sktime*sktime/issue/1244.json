Please describe.**\r\nThe current dataset with exog data for forecasting is `load_longley()` but it has only `len(y)` of `16`, so e.g. `AutoARIMA` fails with this when doing a default  `train_test_split`. Also for vector forecasting, which is probably coming soon, we might need a longer dataset for some forecasters.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe can e.g. `macrodata` from `statsmodels` and pick one column as target `y`:\r\n```python\r\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndf = sm.datasets.macrodata.load_pandas().data\r\ndf.index = pd.PeriodIndex(year=df[\"year\"], quarter=df[\"quarter\"])\r\n# set unemployment rate as y\r\ny = df[\"unemp\"]\r\n# set other columns as X\r\nX = df.drop(columns=[\"unemp\"])\r\n```\r\nI am open for other established datasets that we might use.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nVector forecasting","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1244/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
