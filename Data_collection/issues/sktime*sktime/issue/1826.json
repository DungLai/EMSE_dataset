(40x6x100)\r\nI would expect 22 features per univariate series so an output of 40 instances each with 6 sets of 22 features (40x6x22), but I have an output of size 40x22.\r\nIt's writed: \"The default procedure will concatenate each column prior to transformation\" in the notebook, does that mean that for each instances, the algorithm take the 6 series (for 6 dimensions/columns) and flatten them in a single 600 data point time series ?\r\nDoes the features extracted means something then ? From what I uderstand from catch22 paper, they test their feature extraction method on univariate time series, so I would expect the multivariate version of the implementation of catch22 to apply the feature extractions mehod to each of the 6 univariate time series individually and concatenate the result after. \r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_basic_motions\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.catch22 import Catch22\r\nBM_X_train, BM_y_train = load_basic_motions(split=\"train\", return_X_y=True)\r\nprint(BM_X_train.shape, BM_X_train.iloc[0,0].shape)\r\nc22_mv = Catch22()\r\nc22_output = c22_mv.fit_transform(BM_X_train)\r\nprint(c22_output.shape, c22_output.iloc[0,0])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nI would expect the multivariate version of the implementation of catch22 to apply the feature extractions mehod to each of the 6 univariate time series individually and concatenate the result after.\r\nLike if I use a column transformer on each columns individually:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.compose import ColumnTransformer\r\ntransformer = ColumnTransformer(\r\n    transformers = [(str(i), Catch22(), [BM_X_train.columns[i]]) for i in range(BM_X_train.shape[1])]\r\n)\r\nc22_output = transformer.fit_transform(BM_X_train)\r\nprint(c22_output.shape, c22_output.iloc[0,0])\r\n```\r\nAlthought different format of the outputs could work as discussed here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1719\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n'0.9.0'\r\n<details>\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.12\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 21.2.2\r\n   setuptools: 58.0.4\r\n      sklearn: 1.0.1\r\n       sktime: 0.9.0\r\n  statsmodels: 0.12.1\r\n        numpy: 1.19.3\r\n        scipy: 1.7.3\r\n       Cython: None\r\n       pandas: 1.3.5\r\n   matplotlib: 3.5.1\r\n       joblib: 1.1.0\r\n        numba: 0.54.1\r\n     pmdarima: None\r\n      tsfresh: None\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following code snippet and paste the output here:\r\n \r\nfrom sktime import show_versions; show_versions()\r\n-->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
