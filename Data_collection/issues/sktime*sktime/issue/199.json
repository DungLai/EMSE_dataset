The forecast horizon is given to `fit` and the predictions are calculated in this method instead of in `predict`. This prevents your from using this forecaster in the same interfaces and pipelines as everything else.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link\r\nit in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_forecast(ts, fcstr, test_size=20):\r\n    train, test = ts[:-test_size], ts[-test_size:]\r\n    fh = np.arange(len(test)) + 1\r\n    \r\n    fcstr.fit(train)\r\n    fcstr.predict(fh=fh)\r\n    \r\ndata = load_airline()\r\n\r\nfcstrs = [\r\n    ThetaForecaster(),\r\n    ExpSmoothingForecaster(),\r\n    ARIMAForecaster(),\r\n    DummyForecaster()\r\n]\r\nfor fcstr in fcstrs:\r\n    # ValueError: DummyForecaster requires to specify the forecasting horizon in `fit`\r\n    do_forecast(data, fcstr)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\n`DummyForecaster.fit()` should not require a forecast horizon.
