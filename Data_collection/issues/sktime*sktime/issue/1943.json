I.e., that checks are performed accordingly, and `X`, `X2` being passed to `_transform` with potentially permuted columns.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things to do:\r\n- [ ] the design - what should the behaviour be, where is the parameter set? Probably, it should be a tag, not a constructor argument? Or should it be a constructor argument that all distances have?\r\n- [ ] implement in the base classes\r\n- [ ] write tests to check that particular logic","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1943/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
