This shoudl be investigated as a potential bug.\r\n\r\n### Discussed in https://github.com/sktime/sktime/discussions/3574\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **kylehiroyasu** October 12, 2022</sup>\r\nHi I am just getting started with `sktime` and I have data where some instances are missing measurements at certain time intervals. I expected that I could just using the `Imputer` to interpolate intermediate values as part of a pipeline. However I get an error when the `Imputer.transform` is called on data size data other than the training data:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.impute import Imputer\r\n\r\ntransformer = Imputer()\r\ntrain = np.random.uniform(size=(3,10,20))\r\ntest = np.random.uniform(size=(5,10,20))\r\ntest[2,:,5] = np.nan\r\n\r\ntransformer.fit(train)\r\ntransformer.transform(test)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nCell In [1], line 10\r\n      7 test[2,:,5] = np.nan\r\n      9 transformer.fit(train)\r\n---> 10 transformer.transform(test)\r\n\r\nFile ~/miniconda3/envs/egg_project/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/transformations/base.py:390, in BaseTransformer.transform(self, X, y)\r\n    387     Xt = self._transform(X=X_inner, y=y_inner)\r\n    388 else:\r\n    389     # otherwise we call the vectorized version of predict\r\n--> 390     Xt = self._vectorize(\"transform\", X=X_inner, y=y_inner)\r\n    392 # convert to output mtype\r\n    393 X_out = self._convert_output(Xt, metadata=metadata)\r\n\r\nFile ~/miniconda3/envs/egg_project/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sktime/transformations/base.py:930, in BaseTransformer._vectorize(self, methodname, **kwargs)\r\n    927 n_fit = len(self.transformers_.index)\r\n    929 if n != n_fit:\r\n--> 930     raise RuntimeError(\r\n    931         \"found different number of instances in transform than in fit. \"\r\n    932         f\"number of instances seen in fit: {n_fit}; \"\r\n    933         f\"number of instances seen in transform: {n}\"\r\n    934     )\r\n    936 # transform the i-th series/panel with the i-th stored transformer\r\n    937 Xts = []\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: found different number of instances in transform than in fit. number of instances seen in fit: 3; number of instances seen in transform: 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this the expected behavior? and if so what is the reasoning?
