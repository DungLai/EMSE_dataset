As you can see in the snippet below:\r\n\r\n```    \r\ndef run(self, predict_on_runtime=True, save_strategies=True):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Method for running the orchestrator\r\n        \r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        predict_on_runtime : bool, optional (default=True)\r\n            If True makes predictions after the estimator is trained\r\n        save_strategies : bool, optional (default=True)\r\n            If True saves the trained strategies on the disk\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n\r\n        for task, data in zip(self._tasks, self._datasets):\r\n            dts_loaded = data.load()\r\n```\r\nBut on the documentation we assume that is a list of `DataFrame` pandas. Which doesn't have the `load()` method ([DataFrame documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)). What is being used is a `DatasetHDD` list.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7353520/66721744-07be2280-eddc-11e9-95f8-71ee3d07736e.png)\r\nMinor issue: typo on `skitme`->`sktime`.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n**1. Easiest Solution**\r\nChange the documentation. \r\n`datasets (pandas dataframe) – datasets in pandas skitme format` -> `datasets (list of DatasetHDD) – datasets in DatasetHDD format`\r\n\r\n**2. Accept a DataFrame pandas as parameter to create a DatasetHDD**\r\n\r\n**3. Create a method that converts DataFrame pandas to DatasetHDD**\r\n\r\n**4. Create a .ts file from DataFrame pandas**\r\nI haven't found this option on the code base. I mean, even if this exists, it should be easily to find on the documentation, we should have an update on the [loading data tutorial](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/examples/loading_data.html) if that's the case. If we don't have a `create_tsfile_from_dataframe()`, this can solve the problem creating the tsfile and using it as parameter to the `DatasetHDD`. \r\n\r\n**5. DatasetRAM should be analogous to DatasetHDD**\r\nThe `load()` method on both classes are different. `DatasetHDD` splits the dataset, though the `DatasetRAM` doesn't. Maybe we could create a `Dataset` class and make that the parent class for both `DatasetRAM` and `DatasetHDD`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? If I said something that is not right, please, let me know.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
