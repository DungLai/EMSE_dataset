Please describe.**\r\n\r\nSimilar to seasonality, regressors in Prophet can also be customized (e.g. `mode` argument) ([Ref](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/multiplicative_seasonality.html)). \r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Python\r\nm = Prophet(seasonality_mode='multiplicative')\r\nm.add_seasonality('quarterly', period=91.25, fourier_order=8, mode='additive')\r\nm.add_regressor('regressor', mode='additive')\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sktime` provides the capability to customize seasonality using the `add_seasonality` argument, but nothing like this for regressors. Could this functionality be added to the Prophet class?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nSome way of providing the arguments to use for each regressor which would get added here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/4194aacaa105ef59807ea56c1bb3497b37eb1613/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_fbprophet.py#L95\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nNone that I can think of at this time.
