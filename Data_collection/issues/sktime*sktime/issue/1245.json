For example, see [column transformer](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py) or [compose](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/compose/__init__.py) or [ensemble](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/ensemble/__init__.py). Additional, but brief, information could also be included in some cases, but check with a core developer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: when updating docstrings prioritization should be given to code artifacts that are part of the public API, followed by heavily used non-public code objects. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\nThe goal of the docstring section of the docsprint is to reform all docstrings in the following modules to our preferred format:\r\n   - [ ] annotation\r\n   - [ ] base\r\n   - [ ] classification\r\n   - [ ] clustering\r\n   - [ ] distances\r\n   - [ ] forecasting\r\n   - [ ] performance_metrics\r\n   - [ ] regression\r\n   - [ ] transformations\r\n        - [ ] Boxcox -- Ryan\r\n        - [ ] LogTransformer -- Ryan\r\n        - [ ] ExponentTransformer -- Ryan\r\n        - [ ] SqrtTransformer -- Ryan\r\n        - [ ] ThetaLines -- Guzal\r\n        - [ ] Columnwise -- Guzal\r\n        - [ ] TabularAdapter -- Guzal\r\n        - [ ] Detrender -- Svea\r\n        - [ ] Deseasonalizer -- Svea\r\n        - [ ] ConditionalDeasonalizer -- Svea","closed_by":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1245/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
