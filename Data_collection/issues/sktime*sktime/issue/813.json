Please describe.**\r\nNA\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI thought I'd ask first, before submitting a PR—@MatthewMiddlehurst because it's your code, @kachayev and @RavenRudi because you are working on related PRs—would it be helpful to add [MiniRocket](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/transformations/panel/rocket/_minirocket.py) as an option for ROCKETClassifier?\r\n\r\nIf so, I'd suggest making MiniRocket the default, because it's so much faster than Rocket, but this is only a suggestion.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatively, of course, we could have a separate MINIROCKETClassifier.  This would essentially just duplicate all the ROCKETClassifier code, but perhaps it would be clearer to do it this way.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNA","closed_by":{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/813/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
