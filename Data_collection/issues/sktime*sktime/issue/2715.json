Maybe there could be a minimal `sktime` version which works under all Python versions and all OSes, and put `prophet` and other difficult dependencies into an extra version.","closed_by":{"login":"2-5","id":3753822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTM4MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3753822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5","html_url":"https://github.com/2-5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/2-5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
