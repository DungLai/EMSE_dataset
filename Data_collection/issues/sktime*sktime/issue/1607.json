Please describe.**\r\n\r\nlocation: classification.compose._column_ensemble.py\r\n\r\nthese classifiers need to conform to the new fit, predict, prdict_proba model, but it looks non-trivial. fit does not currently call check_X, but seems to do some of its own bespoke formatting (_validate_column_callables). It also inherits from _HeterogenousMetaEstimator which may complicate things.  I also think there are no unit tests for this classifier. I'm not sure why it is using a label encoder in fit, other classifiers dont. Also not sure why it needs a base class, which is only accessible through the private file (i.e. not in init). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe could just wrap this classifier. Should add unit tests.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could deprecate this?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nin the general refactor of classifier base class.
