Navigate to the root directory of the project and instantiate a conda environment (`conda activate sktime`).\r\n2. Enter in the command line: `make docs`.\r\n3. View the [error](https://gist.github.com/luiszugasti/dfe5dab78c637255465bb22dd68f6b5f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCreation of the docs. I will add that this works fine in WSL2.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nChecked the contents of the \"docs\" folder and the `symlink_examples.sh` document is there. (This is from a fresh clone of the repository)\r\nUnfortunately, I am unsure how Sphinx begins its search through the files.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n<details>\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.8.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jan 25 2021, 22:54:47) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nexecutable: C:\\Users\\Luis\\anaconda3\\envs\\sktime\\python.exe\r\n   machine: Windows-10-10.0.18362-SP0\r\n\r\nPython dependencies:\r\n          pip: 20.2.4\r\n   setuptools: 49.6.0.post20210108\r\n      sklearn: 0.23.2\r\n       sktime: 0.5.3\r\n  statsmodels: 0.12.2\r\n        numpy: 1.20.1\r\n        scipy: 1.6.0\r\n       Cython: 0.29.17\r\n       pandas: 1.1.5\r\n   matplotlib: 3.3.4\r\n       joblib: 1.0.1\r\n        numba: 0.52.0\r\n     pmdarima: 1.8.0\r\n      tsfresh: 0.17.0\r\n</details>","closed_by":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/675/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
