These algorithms are similar enough to the rest of the classification package that they could just reside in a sub-package for now, such as `classification/early_classification`.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the current classification API is suitable for these algorithms, some issues may arise and will require discussion: \r\n- How do we deal with an algorithm refusing to make a prediction? Both in the sense of what would we actually return (`None` seems reasonable) and how would we go about testing, as returning this is likely to break some of the standard classifier ones.\r\n- How do we verify input when predicting? Some algorithms can only make decisions at specific series lengths (commonly in 5% intervals), do any additions need to be made for this, or should it be left to the individual algorithm? \r\n- Some algorithms keep data from previous prediction attempts, i.e. a decision at 15% of the series may use information from the decisions at 5% and 10%. Do we require any additional predict inputs to accommodate this? How do we reset for new data when predicting?\r\n- Do we require an extended base class for any of this? Would having it anyway help with testing, or would it be better as a tag?\r\n\r\nGood first implementations would be [TEASER](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-020-00690-z) and a simple probability threshold for making the decision.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
