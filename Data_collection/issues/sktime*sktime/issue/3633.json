This often results in classifiers/regressors that are big, making it more difficult to test its interface / binding contract in `sktime`. To reduce the testing time, a class method `get_test_param()` is to be used which contains 'smaller' values that will be fed to the constructor for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nTake a look at TapNet's [classifier](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/sktime/classification/deep_learning/tapnet.py#L235) and [regressor](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/sktime/regression/deep_learning/tapnet.py#L216) for how this can be done.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example (for more details, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\nThe errors due to the lack of this method are sporadic in nature but have been caught in various runners like #3525, and #3562, where one of the estimators cause the workers to crash. See #3620 for discussion.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n-->\r\n- Apart from decreasing the testing time by decreasing the model size, one also needs to take care of the fact there is significant code coverage from the choices of parameters.\r\n- At least two sets of params should be provided for this. Kindly check the link provided for tapnet for clarity.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MatthewMiddlehurst","id":25731235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25731235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewMiddlehurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewMiddlehurst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3633/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
