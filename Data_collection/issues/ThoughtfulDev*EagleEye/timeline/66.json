@ronnielivingsince1994 ,\r\nthank you for linking the other issue.\r\nI have not tested this setup on Heroku and as far as i know the webdriver still needs a x-server to run.\r\n\r\nSo when using the dockerfile you need to run the docker container using the following arguments:\r\n```\r\nsudo docker run -t --net=host --env=\"DISPLAY\" \\\r\n                           --volume=\"$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw\"  \\\r\n```\r\nYou need to set the DISPLAY env varibale for Xorg and mount your local .Xauthority so that the docker container can access the hosts x-server.\r\nSo your docker host still needs a xorg server and desktop environment to run the container.\r\nMaybe you can install a desktop environment on heroku and a vnc-server and try it that way?\r\n\r\nHope i could help
