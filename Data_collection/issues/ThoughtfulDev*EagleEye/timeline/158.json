In your case it would become:\r\n\r\n`profile_img_links = driver.find_elements(\"xpath\", \"//a[@class='_2ial']\")`\r\n\r\nothers include:\r\n\r\n`image = e.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, \"img\")\r\nlink_name = self.driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME,'a')`\r\n\r\nYou need to adjust both google.py and facebook.py. After that comes the need to adjust the xpaths.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ThoughtfulDev/EagleEye/issues/comments/1304485990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JamesPiggott","id":9627050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjcwNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9627050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesPiggott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesPiggott/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
