However, since our method is model-agnostic, you can simply replace the VGG-16 with other network. Just keep one point in mind, because we use bilinear pooling as the image representation, the number of channel of the last convolutional layer of your network should not be too large.（否则最后的维度会extremely high）\r\n2、We use a two-stage fine-tuning strategy. In the first stage, only the newly-initialized fc layer is updated (freezing all previous layers)，and the best weights in this stage will be stored in the fc_model folder (named net_params_best.pkl). In the second stage, we continue to fine-tune all network based on the best weight saved in the first stage.\r\n3、Actually, an concurrent work that extending our method for the BIQA of contrasted-altered scenarios has been done. You may read 'No-reference quality assessment for contrast-altered images using an end-to-end deep framework'. You can generate the distortions you want, and then re-train the S-CNN.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/comments/536275852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zwx8981","id":14050646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDUwNjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14050646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981","html_url":"https://github.com/zwx8981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2671089496,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY3MTA4OTQ5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/events/2671089496","actor":{"login":"shenguquanxin","id":41544155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTQ0MTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41544155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin","html_url":"https://github.com/shenguquanxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T09:48:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2671089497,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NzEwODk0OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/events/2671089497","actor":{"login":"shenguquanxin","id":41544155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTQ0MTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41544155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin","html_url":"https://github.com/shenguquanxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T09:48:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/comments/536277833","html_url":"https://github.com/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/10#issuecomment-536277833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/10","id":536277833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjI3NzgzMw==","user":{"login":"shenguquanxin","id":41544155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTQ0MTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41544155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin","html_url":"https://github.com/shenguquanxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenguquanxin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-29T10:04:44Z",
