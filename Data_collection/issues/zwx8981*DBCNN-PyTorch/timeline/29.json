I set:\nscnn_root = 'pretrained_scnn/scnn.pkl'\nckpt = \"your path of the checkpoint file\"\nimage_name = \"4.jpg\"\ncheckpoint = torch.load(ckpt)\nmodel.load_state_dict(checkpoint)\nI comment the code of checkpoint, since it has been set in scnn_root, am I right?\n“4.jpg” is my test image, and I get the output: Prediction = -0.0054. I think the prediction should be [0, 1], so whats wrong with my codes?\nKang\n—\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\nTriage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS or Android. \nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.Message ID: ***@***.***>\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/comments/1005676880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xiongxiongtiao","id":66411001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDExMDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66411001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao","html_url":"https://github.com/xiongxiongtiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongxiongtiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6179289408,"node_id":"CE_lADOCfC6_c5BOSG5zwAAAAFwUHlA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/events/6179289408","actor":{"login":"zwx8981","id":14050646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDUwNjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14050646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981","html_url":"https://github.com/zwx8981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-03T16:09:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
