I have a custom dataset consisting of 5248 images. I made necessary changes to include this in data loader. \r\n\r\nIn dbcnn.py, I provide the list index as (0,5248). Dbcnn.py runs and takes several hours but does not produce even a single epoch.\r\n\r\nWhen I change the list index as (0,29), then dbcnn.py produces training and val images and the script runs and produces 50 epochs that is set\r\n\r\nThe images that I use are taken from Android or iphone. Each image have different resolution. Can. You suggest a way to train on my images only? Is there any other way I can increase the speed of training by pre processing my images for your model?","closed_by":{"login":"zwx8981","id":14050646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDUwNjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14050646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981","html_url":"https://github.com/zwx8981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwx8981/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zwx8981/DBCNN-PyTorch/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
