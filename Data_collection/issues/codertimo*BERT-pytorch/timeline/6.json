Well I was confused the meaning of word \"Bidirectional Transfomer\" at first. But when I saw this description on paper, I knew that `Bidirectional Transfomer = Transformer Encoder` which is used in [Attention All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)\r\n\r\n> We note that in the literature the bidirectional Transformer is often referred to as a “Transformer\r\nencoder” while the left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer decoder” since it can be used for text generation. -BERT Paper Section 3.1 Model Architecture\r\n\r\nSo bi-directional is meaning of, Transformer(self-attention) can see the context, both left and right side. Implementation of Transformer Encoder block is here https://github.com/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/blob/master/model/transformer.py. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to ask more, if you have any question :) have a
