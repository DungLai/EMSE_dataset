function.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11796873/47404382-aee71b80-d77f-11e8-83ce-340832a8f33b.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/comments/432499474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yangze01","id":11796873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzk2ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11796873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01","html_url":"https://github.com/yangze01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangze01/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/comments/432640613","html_url":"https://github.com/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/32#issuecomment-432640613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/32","id":432640613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjY0MDYxMw==","user":{"login":"cairoHy","id":3580577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODA1Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3580577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy","html_url":"https://github.com/cairoHy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cairoHy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-24T12:46:58Z","updated_at":"2018-10-24T12:46:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Probably
