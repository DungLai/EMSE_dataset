Lots of TPUs parallelize about 25% better than GPUs. RTX 2080 Ti and V100 should be ~70% matmul and ~90% matmul perf vs TPU if you use 16-bit (important!). BERT ~= 375 RTX 2080 Ti days or 275 V100 days.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/comments/431041558/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"codertimo","id":9063575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjM1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9063575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo","html_url":"https://github.com/codertimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codertimo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1912504622,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkxMjUwNDYyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/events/1912504622","actor":{"login":"MrRace","id":10300313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzAwMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10300313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace","html_url":"https://github.com/MrRace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-18T14:57:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1912504623,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5MTI1MDQ2MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/events/1912504623","actor":{"login":"MrRace","id":10300313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzAwMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10300313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace","html_url":"https://github.com/MrRace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-18T14:57:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/comments/431216123","html_url":"https://github.com/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/1#issuecomment-431216123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/1","id":431216123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTIxNjEyMw==","user":{"login":"MrRace","id":10300313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzAwMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10300313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace","html_url":"https://github.com/MrRace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-19T01:31:00Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T01:31:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@codertimo
