I have a question about Mask LM loss after I read your code. Your program computes a mask language model loss on both positive sentence pairs and negative pairs. \r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to compute Mask LM loss on negative sentence pairs? I am not sure how Google computes this loss.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MarkWuNLP","id":14267648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY3NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14267648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkWuNLP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkWuNLP/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
