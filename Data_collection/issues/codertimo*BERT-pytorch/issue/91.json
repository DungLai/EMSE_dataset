But the x[:, 0] means I take the first word in every 64 sentences so lead x[:, 0] to has shape of (64, 256). I don't understand why the task NextSentencePrediction should use this kind of input, can someone help me to explain this?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/91/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codertimo/BERT-pytorch/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
