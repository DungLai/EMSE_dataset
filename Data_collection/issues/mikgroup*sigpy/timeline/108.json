To double check that everything is okay on the data side, I would also run the following:\r\n```\r\nlamda = 0.005\r\nimg_tv = mr.app.TotalVariationRecon(ksp, mps, lamda, coord=coord).run()\r\npl.ImagePlot(img_tv, title='Total Variation Regularized Reconstruction')\r\n```\r\nDepending on the conditioning of the problem, you will need to vary the number of iterations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/1065354533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6226609518,"node_id":"CE_lADOCFKrHc5Fg0WuzwAAAAFzIoVu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/events/6226609518","actor":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-11T18:03:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
