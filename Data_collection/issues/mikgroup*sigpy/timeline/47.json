Just some thoughts below:\r\n\r\nI guess this is not straightforward. Splitting the data need to be done carefully, depending the operation I'm doing, it might be difficult to split matrix along the encoding and channel dimension. It will work only if I have independent datasets (like 2D multi-slice) but what is the preferable way if want to reconstruct one dataset with regularization on subsampled dimension: [kx, ky, kz, cha, contrast] ?\r\n\r\nI would like to have your opinion, if we consider a 5D dataset with random acceleration along ky and kz and multiple contrasts. Do you think that it is possible to split the data along the readout direction (fully sampled) for non linear reconstruction? I know it is possible for standard 3D GRAPPA as the kernel application is the same in every location but here I'm not really sure. \r\n\r\nIf you have any example regarding the communicator object I will be interested to use it. This might be particularly usefull for optimizing parameters as the reconstruction time seems relatively long on one CPU.   \r\n\r\nThanks in

You are correct in that applying a 3D regularizer will result in slightly different solutions based on how you partition your data. I would personally expect better wavelet sparsity the larger the readout block, but I would test this.\r\n\r\nThat being said, in my experience, most of the computational burden comes from the least squares (or data consistency) term. If A is your forward operator, I would recommend that you use the ```ToDevice``` Linop along with the ```Diag```, ```Hstack``` and ```Vstack``` to break a large problem into smaller ones so that Ax, AHx and AHA that can be processed on the GPU.  For most kinds of problems in MRI, this ```ToDevice``` trick will work directly for the coil dimension.  I would also recommend looking into the communicator object, as described by Frank, to use multiple CPUs in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you would like to use a full volume wavelet transform and it does not fit on the GPU, you can process it on the CPU while still taking advantage of the GPU for the data-consistency term.\r\n\r\nNote that there will be some penalty to moving data around.\r\n\r\nFor an example of splitting multi-contrast data to perform non-linear reconstruction, please take a look at the following. An example reconstruction pipeline is discussed in-depth.\r\n\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04195.pdf\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/621914511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/621946287","html_url":"https://github.com/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/47#issuecomment-621946287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/47","id":621946287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTk0NjI4Nw==","user":{"login":"valeryozenne","id":7050315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTAzMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7050315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne","html_url":"https://github.com/valeryozenne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T16:01:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T16:01:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, it helps a lot.
