PR makes cupy more of an optional dependency in sigpy. When cupy import fails, sigpy raises a warning, instead of an error. This allows sigpy to continue operating without cupy being available.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis scenario is difficult to simulate via unittests. However, it was verified in the case below:\r\n\r\nScenario:`machineA` has gpu, `machineB` does not have gpu. Both machines share a single NAS filesystem.\r\n1. Conda environment created using machineA on shared NAS. This environment is also visible to machineB\r\n2. `import sigpy` works on machineA - this is expected and was happening before.\r\n3. `import sigpy` also works on machineB, even though gpu is not
