I found a solution that seems to work! :)\r\nI will leave it here so that  aybe it can help someone else:\r\n``` python\r\ndevice = 0\r\n[nt,nz,nc,ny,nx] = oshape\r\nDr = sp.linop.ToDevice([nc,ny,nx], \r\n                      odevice = device, #GPU\r\n                      idevice = -1) #CPU\r\nDl = sp.linop.ToDevice(ksp.shape[-3:], \r\n                      odevice = -1, #CPU\r\n                      idevice = device) #GPU\r\nF = sp.linop.Diag([Dl*sp.linop.NUFFT([nc,nx,nx], \r\n                                       sp.to_device(np.squeeze(coord[tt,:,:,:]),device), \r\n                                       oversamp, \r\n                                       width)*Dr for tt in range(nt) for sl in range(nz) ])\r\nRs1 = sp.linop.Reshape(oshape=F.ishape, ishape=oshape)\r\nRs2 = sp.linop.Reshape(oshape=ksp.shape, ishape=F.oshape)\r\nFT = Rs2*F*Rs1\r\noutput = FT.H * (ksp * dcf[:,np.newaxis,np.newaxis,:,:]).astype(np.complex64)\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust as a disclaimer: this is not the optimal solution, but it's the one that allows you to use the gpu (with still a significant speedup) while transfering just a little chunck of data at a time (a 2D slice of a single time frame)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/615512627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mscipio","id":17526160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTI2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17526160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio","html_url":"https://github.com/mscipio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/619619607","html_url":"https://github.com/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/46#issuecomment-619619607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/46","id":619619607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTYxOTYwNw==","user":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-26T20:23:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-26T20:23:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Please
