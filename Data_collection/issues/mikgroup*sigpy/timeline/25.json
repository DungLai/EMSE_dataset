is preliminary code to address issue #25. I have not modified any other functions yet as I wanted to run this by you first. The main goal of this commit is to use PyWavelet's wavelet coefficients to perform n-dimensional forward and inverse wavelet transforms using generic numpy/cupy functions. This should hopefully allow for wavelet to be used directly on the GPU. (I have not tested this on the GPU yet, but will be soon.) The main question I wanted to ask is the following: To ease n-dimensional processing, fwt returns a dictionary that iwt takes as input.

Is there any plan to allow wavelet to run on gpu?\r\n\r\nthanks a lot for this amazing tool!\r\nMarco","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/1136083069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcobattiston1988","id":29372400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzcyNDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29372400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988","html_url":"https://github.com/marcobattiston1988","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/1137390687","html_url":"https://github.com/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/25#issuecomment-1137390687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/25","id":1137390687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFKrHc5DyzRf","user":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T14:58:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T14:58:14Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI think @frankong was worried about the correctness of my implementation.

Sid,\r\n\r\nI have been looking a bit into the solution proposed here\r\n\r\nI ran some quick tests on 2D data, comparing forward transform using this implementation and the one in PyWavelets. Qualitatively, it looks reasonably similar, although coefficient absolute values are a bit different. It also has a different size, probably the zero padding is applying in a slightly different way, as when I look at the tiled coefficients they appear a bit shifted? Another thing I noticed, when looking at residual error of a forward+backward transform, this new implementation shows a slighltly higher error compared to the forward+backward of pywavelet (still the effect on the input image could not be appreciated). These were just qualitative tests, I am happy to go a bit more in detail with the comparison if needed...Do you rememeber by any chance what the issue was when you first incorporated this? I can try to focus on that...\r\n\r\nRegarding the performace, I had hard time to get decent computation times. \r\nInitially, this solution was way slower than the PyWavelet implementation, although I could see some activity on the GPU. Using the nvidia profiler (NSight), I could see that the GPU workload was getting much more intermittent right after the first iteration of the GradientMethod. I tried to move into the initialization of the Wavelet linear operator as much operations as possible, but that didn't really help. The key move was to downgrade my cuda version, from 11.4 to 11.2 (I am running this on Windows 10), and all of sudden I got a factor 10 of reduction in recon time (and I can see that the GPU is working consistently).\r\nNow recon times are more comparable with the pywavelet implementation. Actually on 3D data, this is now more the 50% faster, while it is roughly 50% slower than the original implementation on 2D data... I am definitely not an expert on code optimization (even worse on GPU), but I believe there is some room for improvement...\r\n\r\nLook forward to your feedbacks\r\n(and thanks a lot for the effort you put into sigpy!!!)\r\n\r\nMarco\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/1164188845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcobattiston1988","id":29372400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzcyNDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29372400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988","html_url":"https://github.com/marcobattiston1988","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcobattiston1988/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/1179278782","html_url":"https://github.com/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/25#issuecomment-1179278782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/25","id":1179278782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFKrHc5GSl2-","user":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-08T18:57:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T18:59:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi Marco,\r\n\r\nThanks much for the tests! I will personally be a swamped for a few months but if you're willing to take the lead, I'd be happy to review any pull-requests on this.\r\n\r\nThe following are what I envision would need to be done before the GPU version can be implemented:\r\n\r\n1. (Not GPU specific) Generally, modify the wavelet calls and linops to take in the `modes` argument used in `pywt` (details: https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/regression/modes.html).\r\n2. (GPU specific) Given the same chosen modes, require that the CPU output and GPU output are less then a certain amount of error (say, 1e-4% to 1e-6% of the top of my head). This will be really helpful for unit-tests!\r\n\r\nOn the performance difference, I think we can revisit it after (2) is done! Once that's set as a baseline, we can look at optimizations.\r\n\r\nThanks much for all you've reported on so far already!
