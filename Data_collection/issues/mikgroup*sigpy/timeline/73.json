I tried specifying the crop value as 0.90, 0.85, and 0.80 in the ESPIRiT app. A crop value of 0.90 resolved the issue with the sensitivity maps **most** of the undersampled data. This **problem still exists for certain data**\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n![AXFLAIR_202_TV_90_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115280224-fb8cf100-a147-11eb-949f-b783b259a4e5.png)  ![AXFLAIR_206_TV_90_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115280235-ffb90e80-a147-11eb-8ca7-2e386a0f8de5.png)\r\n\r\n![AXT1_201_TV_90_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115280267-0ba4d080-a148-11eb-9f2c-c9d6b5c6d5ba.png) ![AXT1PRE_200_TV_90_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115280519-50c90280-a148-11eb-8814-0e0d8cdb7611.png) ![AXT1POST_201_TV_90_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115280603-69391d00-a148-11eb-9f49-3f5f7a5cc790.png)\r\n\r\nI tried reducing the crop value to 0.80 but the problem still exists to some extent for certain data, so I believe it could be a data-specific Issue. I will check if adjusting the Kernel_width parameter helps with completely eliminating this issue with sens maps (regardless of the acquisition & data?)\r\n\r\nDo you also think adjusting Kernel_width

I have 150 files, each containing k-space data of different acquisitions [AXFLAIR, AXT1, AXT1POST, AXT1PRE, AXT2]. Choosing the default crop & kernel_width was producing the unexpected maps for some data while working fine for the other when ESPIRiT was run on GPU. \r\n\r\n**By trial and error, A crop of 0.70 and kernel_width of 5 in ESPIRiT generated the expected sensitivity maps for all the data**(irrespective of acquisition type), thus enabling better reconstruction of the undersampled data.\r\n\r\n![AXFLAIR_202_TV_70_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115781777-26cb4680-a3bb-11eb-92b4-44c968005aed.png)![AXFLAIR_206_TV_5_70_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115781812-3054ae80-a3bb-11eb-8f55-2ab32470209d.png)\r\n![AXT1_201_TV_70_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115781842-39458000-a3bb-11eb-8646-1612fcd15642.png)![AXT1PRE_200_TV_70_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115781869-42365180-a3bb-11eb-80f3-3e6b477d3dc0.png)\r\n![AXT1POST_201_TV_80_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59664991/115781878-45c9d880-a3bb-11eb-91fa-acea0fc35950.png)\r\n\r\n**Could
