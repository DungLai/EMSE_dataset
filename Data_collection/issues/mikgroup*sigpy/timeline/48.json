Instead you probably want to do multiply `y` with `dcf**0.5` and `A` with `sigpy.linop.Multiply(y.shape, dcf**0.5)` as well.\r\n\r\nYou can also directly use the [SenseRecon App](https://sigpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/sigpy.mri.app.SenseRecon.html#sigpy.mri.app.SenseRecon). It uses the LinearLeastSquares App and supports `z` and other arguments. You can use the `weights` argument to supply `dcf`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/comments/620086799/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"frankong","id":9143405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9143405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong","html_url":"https://github.com/frankong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3323003779,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzMyMzAwMzc3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/events/3323003779","actor":{"login":"mscipio","id":17526160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTI2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17526160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio","html_url":"https://github.com/mscipio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T13:36:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
