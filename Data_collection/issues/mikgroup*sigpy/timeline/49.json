When that array is no longer referenced, python may keep that memory in its memory pool for future arrays rather than returning it to the OS (for efficiency purposes). That is why used_bytes may drop to 0 after the array is no longer referenced (i.e. when you \"delete\" the app), but total_bytes remains the same; total_bytes shows the memory remaining in the memory pool of that python program. When you restart the python kernel, obviously all memory is returned to the OS.\r\n\r\nIf you need that memory returned to the OS right after the app finishes running, delete all references to that app (e.g. `app = None`), and then for CuPy you can do `mempool.free_all_blocks()`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I've noticed in some cases that python _will_ return memory to the OS as soon as the array is no longer referenced if the array is really large.\r\n\r\nI hope this addresses your problem.
