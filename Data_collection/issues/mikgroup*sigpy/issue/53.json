I'm trying to do spline interpolation but when I specify `kernel='spline'` I get an error which I understand after looking in the source code where the kernel is specified as an array. Can you provide some guidance for how to use this function by specifying the kernel as an array? In particular, I'd be interested to know if it would be possible to do nearest neighbour gridding.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"frankong","id":9143405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9143405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong","html_url":"https://github.com/frankong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
