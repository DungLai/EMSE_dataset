Please describe.**\r\nCurrently SigPy functions get the device from the first argument, and perform operations in that device. This is inconsistent with CuPy, which simply uses the device in the current context.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nChange all SigPy functions to use the device in the current context, with CPU as default. If inputs are inconsistent, an error will occur.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nKeep the same interface for compatibility reasons.
