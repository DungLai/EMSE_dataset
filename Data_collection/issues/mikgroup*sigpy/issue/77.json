Please describe.**\r\nCuPy is a useful library for GPU-based ndarray operations; however there can often be issues with installation. SigPy has been useful in making the CuPy dependency optional; however, in the current state, the dependency is not really optional.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the `cupy` library is installed (`pip/conda install`) but not properly configured (e.g. wrong nvcc version is active), the importing `cupy` fails as shown below. Currently, sigpy attempts to set `cupy_enabled` by checking `util.find_spec(\"cupy\") is not None`. However, this is not sufficient, as the cupy package can still be installed but can fail on import.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import cupy\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/usr/miniconda3/envs/dl_ss_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cupy/__init__.py\", line 16, in <module>\r\n    from cupy import _core  # NOQA\r\n  File \"/home/usr/miniconda3/envs/dl_ss_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cupy/_core/__init__.py\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    from cupy._core import core  # NOQA\r\nImportError: libcublas.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/usr/miniconda3/envs/dl_ss_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cupy/__init__.py\", line 37, in <module>\r\n    raise ImportError(_msg) from e\r\nImportError: CuPy is not correctly installed.\r\n\r\nIf you are using wheel distribution (cupy-cudaXX), make sure that the version of CuPy you installed matches with the version of CUDA on your host.\r\nAlso, confirm that only one CuPy package is installed:\r\n  $ pip freeze\r\n\r\nIf you are building CuPy from source, please check your environment, uninstall CuPy and reinstall it with:\r\n  $ pip install cupy --no-cache-dir -vvvv\r\n\r\nCheck the Installation Guide for details:\r\n  https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/install.html\r\n\r\noriginal error: libcublas.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nEven if `import cupy` fails when `cupy` is installed, sigpy should not fail. Currently, sigpy passes along the ImportError raised by cupy, which causes sigpy to error out.\r\n\r\nBecause cupy is an optional dependency, sigpy should catch the exception, print a warning message to the user, and continue on with `cupy_enabled=False`. I believe the code below should do the trick:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# in sigpy.config\r\nfrom importlib import util\r\nimport warnings\r\n\r\ncupy_enabled = util.find_spec(\"cupy\") is not None\r\nif cupy_enabled:\r\n    try:\r\n        import cupy\r\n    except ImportError as e:\r\n        warnings.warn(e)\r\n        cupy_enabled=False\r\nif cupy_enabled:  # pragma: no cover\r\n    cudnn_enabled = util.find_spec(\"cupy.cuda.cudnn\") is not None\r\n    nccl_enabled = util.find_spec(\"cupy.cuda.nccl\") is not None\r\nelse:\r\n    cudnn_enabled = False\r\n    nccl_enabled = False\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"frankong","id":9143405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9143405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong","html_url":"https://github.com/frankong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/77/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/77/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
