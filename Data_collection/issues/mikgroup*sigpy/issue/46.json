The coordinate sampling scheme is basically a radial sampling in the axial plane x-y, and a full cartesian sampling in the z direction.\r\n\r\nI built my own function for this purpose, but the only way I am able to perfome the 3D reconstruction, is if I loop each slice at a time, along the z direction. If I pass the all kspace to the function sp.nufft_adjoint, I get all sorts of errors.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking that maybe the problem is in the shape of the kspace.\r\nSo far I am trying to pass it as: `[n_coils, n_slices, n_spokes, n_ro]`\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"mscipio","id":17526160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTI2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17526160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio","html_url":"https://github.com/mscipio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
