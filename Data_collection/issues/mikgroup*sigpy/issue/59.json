Finding that out was surprisingly difficult, as sigpy does not have a sigpy.__version__ member. Instead, I actually started comparing the source code that I found in my python path.\r\n\r\nOf course, with pip (and probably conda), there are other ways of finding out the installed version, but not when installing it manually.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think it'd be a good idea to add a __version__ string to sigpy.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about python packaging, but it could probably live in a file and just be read into, for example, setup.py. This would also make sure that that version is always accurate.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nChristian","closed_by":{"login":"frankong","id":9143405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9143405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong","html_url":"https://github.com/frankong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
