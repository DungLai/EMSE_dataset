Please describe.**\r\nThere is no wavelet transform in GPU. Currently, SigPy moves array to CPU and uses pywavelet to perform the wavelet transform, which is the main bottleneck for compressed sensing MRI reconstructions.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA GPU wavelet transform can leverage the GPU multi-channel convolution operations already wrapped in SigPy. Low pass and high pass filtering can be done in one operation using the output channels. Strides can be used to incorporate subsampling.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nImplement the GPU kernels for wavelet transforms. But this would be less optimized than cuDNN convolutions.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"frankong","id":9143405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9143405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong","html_url":"https://github.com/frankong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
