I have been trying to reconstruct a radially sampled dataset acquired on a Siemens Biograph mMR scanner. I have a matlab script that is able to decode the proprietary raw data format, and then I can load a kspace in python using h5py.\r\n\r\nThe full dimension of the dataset is [512,2400,47,6], [#samples, #spokes, #slices, #coils ] respectively. When I load it into python the shape changes to (6, 47, 2400, 512), as expected.\r\n\r\nI tried to go straigth to 3D, but either I made something wrong (likely) or your code needs an insane amount of RAM to manage that dataset.\r\n\r\nThen I simplified the problem and went to 2D, with a kspace shape of (6, 2400, 512), with the hope of being able to follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/mikgroup/sigpy-mri-tutorial) more closely.\r\nI created a coord structure as:\r\n`coord =  sp.mri.radial([spokes,nx,2], img_shape=[128,128], golden = True)`\r\n\r\nand a dcf as suggested in the tutorial:\r\n`dcf = (coord[..., 0]**2 + coord[..., 1]**2)**0.5`\r\n\r\nI am able to reconstruct using a standard:\r\n`img_grid = sp.nufft_adjoint(ksp * dcf, coord)`\r\n\r\nbut the results are not even close to the abdominal image I was expecting.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17526160/79013708-4f2d2d80-7b37-11ea-852e-f0511b34b129.png)\r\n\r\nAny idea what could have gone wrong?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mscipio","id":17526160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTI2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17526160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio","html_url":"https://github.com/mscipio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mscipio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
