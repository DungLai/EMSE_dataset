I would like to use and benchmark Sigpy. I'm not yet familiar with it, I might have missed something. \r\n\r\nInstallation (and tutorial) run smootly using pip for the libraries and using the command python3 setup.py install. I'm using a laptop on Ubuntu 18.04 with \r\n- Intel® Core™ i7-4910MQ CPU @ 2.90GHz × 8\r\n- Nvidia Quadro 4Go \r\n- 32 Go Ram.\r\n\r\nI didn't succeed to use/activate multi-cpu usage for performing operation either IFFT and coil map estimation or the L1WaveletRecon.  For instance, EspiritCalib never finished while JsenseRecon was actually running on but one cpu as well as the L1WaveletRecon. Do you have any example to follow ?\r\n\r\nThe code is here in case: https://github.com/valeryozenne/sigpy-3D-ifft-cms/blob/master/main.py\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nValéry","closed_by":{"login":"valeryozenne","id":7050315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTAzMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7050315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne","html_url":"https://github.com/valeryozenne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valeryozenne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/47/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
