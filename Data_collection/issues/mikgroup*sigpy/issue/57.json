However, `numba` only supports a select number of `numpy` operations and no longer supports the `RandomState` class in functions decorated with `nb.jit`. This is likely the source of the error.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sigpy.mri.samp import poisson\r\n\r\n# Not the issue occurs with any arbitrary image size and acceleration.\r\nmask = poisson((320, 320), accel=6, seed=80)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExpect to have no error in call while still ensuring that global numpy state does not change when seed is specified in `sigpy.mri.samp.poisson`.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"frankong","id":9143405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9143405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong","html_url":"https://github.com/frankong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/57/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/57/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
