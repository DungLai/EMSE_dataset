It seems the shape of the coil sensitivity maps is determined by `sp.estimate_shape(coord)`.\r\n\r\nFor example, when using a 3D centre-out radial trajectory that corresponds to an image size of 128, the min/max coordinates are something like\r\n```\r\n(kx_min, kx_max) = (-63.99089, 63.984524)\r\n(ky_min, ky_max) = (-63.988026, 63.93878)\r\n(kz_min, kz_max) = (-64.0, 63.914078)\r\n```\r\nWhen I give the corresponding array of k-space coordinates to sp.estimate_shape, the output estimated shape is `[127, 127, 127]`, instead of the expected `[128, 128, 128]`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best fix for this is... The simplest thing to do is to change the `int()` function in `estimate_shape` to `round()`:\r\n```python\r\nshape = [round(coord[..., i].max().item() - coord[..., i].min().item())\r\n         for i in range(ndim)]\r\n```\r\nBut this will change historic results, and still might not produce the expected shape for certain trajectories.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, all functions and classes that rely on `estimate_shape` can be modified so that a shape can be provided explicitly as an argument, and only when a shape isn't provided explicitly will `estimate_shape` be used. Functions and classes that rely on `estimate_shape` are:\r\n```\r\nnufft_adjoint (this function can already accept a shape explicitly)\r\nJsenseRecon\r\nConvSense\r\nConvImage\r\npipe_menon_dcf\r\n```\r\nThe change is relatively straight forward... but since so many different functions/classes will be changed, I thought I'd ask here first for opinions and discussion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"frankong","id":9143405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDM0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9143405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong","html_url":"https://github.com/frankong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
