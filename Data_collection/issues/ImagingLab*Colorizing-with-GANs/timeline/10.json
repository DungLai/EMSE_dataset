Having said that, you need to provide RGB image as input. The model automatically extracts the grayscale from the RGB image and feed it to the model. My guess is that in your test dataset you are providing the grayscale image as input and that's why you are getting tensor mismatch error.\r\n\r\nWe understand the need for a test method that runs on a grayscale image and we are going to implement one in just a few
