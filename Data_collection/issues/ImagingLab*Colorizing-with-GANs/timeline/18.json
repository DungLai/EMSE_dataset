The network then learns a transformation from noise (uniform distribution) to the data distribution. In CGAN (conditional GAN) since data is partly available as input (grayscale image in our case) the input noise is not very effective! To prevent the network to be completely predictive, some authors suggest\r\nto use dropout as a form of noise in training!\r\nIn our early experiments, we used dropout for that matter. However, later we found it not really effective! In the code `kernel[2]` refers to the 3rd index of the kernel options used to define a network! As you can see here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/blob/9abfa2ba5924a90b7cf756352abc00d50364df32/src/models.py#L328-L335\r\n\r\nRight now dropout value is set to zero for every kernel option, meaning we are not applying dropout anywhere in the network!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/comments/468374254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2171860792,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE3MTg2MDc5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/events/2171860792","actor":{"login":"huangchaoxing","id":35922929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTIyOTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35922929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing","html_url":"https://github.com/huangchaoxing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-28T18:02:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2171860793,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNzE4NjA3OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/events/2171860793","actor":{"login":"huangchaoxing","id":35922929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTIyOTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35922929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing","html_url":"https://github.com/huangchaoxing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchaoxing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-28T18:02:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
