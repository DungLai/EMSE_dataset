The problem is with u-net architecture using strided convolution for downsampling and odd dimensions. Let's say your input dimension is (184 x 274), using 7 layers of strided convolution here's what you get in the encoder branch:\r\n`\r\n(184 x 274) -> (92, 137) -> (46, 69) -> (23, 35) -> (12, 18) -> (6, 9) -> (3, 5) -> (2, 3)\r\n`\r\n\r\nIn the decoder brach we upsample with factor of 2 and concatenate with their corresponding encoder layer:\r\n`\r\n(2, 3) -> (4, 6) -> (8, 12) -> (16, 24) -> (32, 48) -> (64, 96) -> (128, 192) -> (256, 384)\r\n`\r\n\r\nAnd as you can see the decoder branch completely diverges and the reason is that at some point in the encoder branch, one of the dimensions of the output is an odd number!\r\n\r\nTo prevent that, you can either make sure that your input is a power of 2 (128, 256, 512, ...) or if your input size is fixed, adjust the convolution paddings in the encoder branch, to make sure an output dimension is always an even number!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/comments/452917225/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knazeri","id":1743048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDMwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri","html_url":"https://github.com/knazeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knazeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2064591209,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA2NDU5MTIwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/events/2064591209","actor":{"login":"PeterVennerstrom","id":36269250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY5MjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36269250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom","html_url":"https://github.com/PeterVennerstrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-09T23:54:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2064591211,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNjQ1OTEyMTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/events/2064591211","actor":{"login":"PeterVennerstrom","id":36269250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY5MjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36269250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom","html_url":"https://github.com/PeterVennerstrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterVennerstrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-09T23:54:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/comments/452978243","html_url":"https://github.com/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/12#issuecomment-452978243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/12","id":452978243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mjk3ODI0Mw==","user":{"login":"liwt31","id":22628546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22628546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31","html_url":"https://github.com/liwt31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liwt31/received_events","type":"User","site_adm
