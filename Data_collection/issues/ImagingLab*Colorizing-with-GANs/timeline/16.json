At the time, the only solution was to either slow than the discriminator's learning rate or train generator twice as much. It does not necessarily improve the result, but rather stabilize the training!\r\n\r\nHowever, I suggest the following recent papers for both stability and improvement:\r\n- [Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957)\r\n- [Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318)\r\n- [Geometric
