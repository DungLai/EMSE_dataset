Read that it was successfully utilized for similar tasks (in pix2pix and cycle-GANs for example), but when I gave it a try in my PyTorch implementation, I achieved little to no success. Do you have an intuition on why batch normalization works better for on this specific task but not others?","closed_by":{"login":"karoly-hars","id":39346572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzQ2NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39346572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars","html_url":"https://github.com/karoly-hars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karoly-hars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ImagingLab/Colorizing-with-GANs/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
