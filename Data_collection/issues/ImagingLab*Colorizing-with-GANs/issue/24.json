Any insight to what I might be doing wrong?\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n1) I downloaded cifar10 data and placed it in  ./dataset/cifar10\r\n2) I downloaded the pre-trained cifar10 weights and placed them in  ./checkpoints/cifar10.\r\n3) I converted some cifar10 images to grayscale and put them in  ./checkpoints/test\r\n4) I run the test script as follows:\r\n`python test.py --dataset cifar10 --checkpoints-path ./checkpoints --test-input ./checkpoints/test --test-output ./checkpoints/output --gpu-ids 0\r\n`\r\n## Results\r\nThe output is blotchy and not what I expected.
