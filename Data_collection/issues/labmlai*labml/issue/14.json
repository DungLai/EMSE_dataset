First of all, great job. It really saved me from the usual research mess :)\r\nI have some questions about the checkpointing. I've seen that each layer is saved in a .npy format. However, this does not work for other objects that are based on `state_dict`, for example optimizers. For long trainings they should be saved with the model, since we don't want to retrain the whole model from scratch. I've looked into your checkpointing strategy [here](https://github.com/vpj/lab/blob/master/lab/experiment/pytorch.py#L41). Do you see any significant problem if instead saving all layers in .npy files we directly save the `state_dict`?
