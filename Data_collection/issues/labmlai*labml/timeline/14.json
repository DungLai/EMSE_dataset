Your approach makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nThe decision to save to numpy was done way back when **lab** was for Tensorflow, and I left it when we added PyTorch support and later dropped Tensorflow support (because none of the **lab** users seemed to be using Tensorflow).\r\n\r\nI have personally being resetting optimizers (to save checkpoint sizes and because it didn't have a huge effect on the tasks I was working on) so I didn't come across this problem yet. Saving as `state_dict` directly is both simpler and probably future proof to any changes PyTorch might make too.\r\n\r\nI'll merge you request, ASAP. I just want to add some backward compatibility to load back old checkpoints saved in numpy formats. I will close the issue once we merge it.\r\n\r\nThanks again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labmlai/labml/issues/comments/612712787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vpj","id":81152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj","html_url":"https://github.com/vpj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labmlai/labml/issues/comments/612912426","html_url":"https://github.com/labmlai/labml/issues/14#issuecomment-612912426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labmlai/labml/issues/14","id":612912426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjkxMjQyNg==","user":{"login":"fabvio","id":10325202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzI1MjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10325202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio","html_url":"https://github.com/fabvio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabvio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-13T14:05:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T14:05:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great!
