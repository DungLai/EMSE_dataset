We've had a bunch instances before we wrote this library where we had  results that we couldn't reproduce because the code has changed. We had to try going back to old commits to find when it worked.\r\n\r\n `check_repo_dirty` checks if there are uncommitted changes before running an experiment. This is different from tracking the git commit. It just throws an error if there are uncommitted changes.
