I think this implementation changes it as n*loss=L1+...+Lk. And for this loss function, it can use this implementation. For loss=p1*L1+...+pk*Lk, you need to divide ni for each loss function in local clients and then weighted sum their parameters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shaoxiongji/federated-learning/issues/comments/917015734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"haoyu0408","id":61435722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDM1NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61435722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyu0408","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyu0408/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
