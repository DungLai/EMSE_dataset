You may want to sample a large number of points to cover the environment as much as possible\r\n(2) transform those points into the global frame using the poses estimated from the trained L-Net\r\n(3) use the trained M-Net to estimate the occupancy probabilities\r\n(4) covert the 2D global coordinates to the pixel coordinates and generate the occupancy map from the estimated probabilities and the pixel coordinates.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ai4ce/DeepMapping/issues/comments/565860170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmax123","id":17237996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM3OTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17237996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123","html_url":"https://github.com/dmax123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ai4ce/DeepMapping/issues/comments/566273305","html_url":"https://github.com/ai4ce/DeepMapping/issues/8#issuecomment-566273305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ai4ce/DeepMapping/issues/8","id":566273305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjI3MzMwNQ==","user":{"login":"Skywalker666666","id":22225622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22225622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666","html_url":"https://github.com/Skywalker666666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skywalker666666/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-16T22:23:52Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T22:23:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nThanks for your quick reply.\r\nI solved this problem now.
