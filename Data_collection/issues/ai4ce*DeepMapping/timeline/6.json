In this way, the y-value remains approximately the same (distance from the robot to the ground). So the L-net does not predict it. For rotation, the AVD dataset only has one degree-of-freedom (yaw). More details about this dataset can be found on their website.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to predict 6-DOF for other dataset, you need (1) change the number of output in the L-Net to 6, and (2) write the `transform_to_global(pose, obs_local)` function","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ai4ce/DeepMapping/issues/comments/546030053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmax123","id":17237996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM3OTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17237996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123","html_url":"https://github.com/dmax123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmax123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2754159011,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc1NDE1OTAxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ai4ce/DeepMapping/issues/events/2754159011","actor":{"login":"WordBearerYI","id":22203484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjAzNDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22203484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI","html_url":"https://github.com/WordBearerYI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WordBearerYI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T23:34:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
