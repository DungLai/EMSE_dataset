From the docs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:param latent_time: if True, resolve expressions that contain only a time\r\n                    (e.g. 8:00 pm) to be the next matching time after\r\n                    reference time *ts*\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis parameter only applies to `expressions that contain only a time` - that is maybe why we called it `latent_time`. Our use case when building this was simply that we did not want \"pure time\" expressions to be grounded to some (in that case arbitrary) date.
