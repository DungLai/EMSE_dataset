More detailedly, 18.682 the raw one, 18.103 the regenerated one. But I'm not so familiar with the sklearn's naive bayes model. I am not sure weather it is a problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/comtravo/ctparse/issues/comments/547402372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"public1024","id":17823646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIzNjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17823646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024","html_url":"https://github.com/public1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/public1024/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/comtravo/ctparse/issues/comments/547410001","html_url":"https://github.com/comtravo/ctparse/issues/69#issuecomment-547410001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/comtravo/ctparse/issues/69","id":547410001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzQxMDAwMQ==","user":{"login":"gabrielelanaro","id":239875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/239875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielelanaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T13:07:34Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T13:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@public1024 there is a bug in `run_corpus` (as you noted it's about `id`, which is a function).
