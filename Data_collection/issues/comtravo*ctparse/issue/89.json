It would reduce package size and issues integrating with other libs significantly when we would remove these deps - by simply having a private implementation.\r\n\r\nOnly caveat: the naive Bayes is called very often and at least it prediction runtime is crucial for the speed of `ctparse`. Any replacement should not be slower than what we currently have.","closed_by":{"login":"sebastianmika","id":7964253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjQyNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7964253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianmika","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianmika/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/comtravo/ctparse/issues/89/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/comtravo/ctparse/issues/89/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
