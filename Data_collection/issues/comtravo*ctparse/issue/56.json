This is due to how `ruleDDMMYYYY` handles two digit years. It should probably not \"hard move\" them to the 21st century but rather use some cutoff year within the century of the reference time.\r\n\r\nThis is how Excel handles this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/excel/two-digit-year-numbers\r\n\r\nSuggestion: \r\n* Let the reference year be `ccyy` (e.g. `1983 => cc=19, yy=83`).\r\n* Then any two digit year between 0 and yy+10 is interpreted to be within the century cc (e.g. 83 maps to 1983, 93 to 1993), anything above maps to the previous century (e.g. 94 maps to 1894).\r\n* In 2019 this would mean that anything up to 29 maps to 20xx, 30+ would map to 1930+","closed_by":{"login":"gabrielelanaro","id":239875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/239875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielelanaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielelanaro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/comtravo/ctparse/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/comtravo/ctparse/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
