Expected behavior is for the mask data to be embedded into the aligned images (perhaps not specific terminology, but more or less I just expect it to finish it tasks) \r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nProcess begins running and instantly errors out, stating the access is denied. The errors are not particularly informative, but it appears as though Python might be crashing or locking up, creating an access error? Additionally, once this script is run, every single other script will also fail, stating the access is denied. (Eg, if I were to attempt to run say train Quick96.bat afterward, it would fail and the command prompt will just return \"Access is Denied.\" I haven't found any other way to correct this except rebooting the OS. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSince I haven't seen other reported cases of this, I would imagine there is some sort of bad interaction going on with my local machine, but for myself, it's simply run script 5.)XSeg) data_dst trained mask - apply.bat\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\nExploration with ProcMon and ProcExplorer don't seem to show any process as being stuck \"hanging\". Error messages are all truncated, and I haven't been able to find the logging to attempt to get the full output. When testing file permission changes to attempt to rule out Access problems after the initial error, the permission changes would continually fail to modify python.exe, as though it was still still in use, despite both ProcMon and ProcExplorer failing to show it. \r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure what's going on here, and the truncated error messages and lack of logs are making it very difficult to troubleshoot it more specifically than this.
