The same happens with the main build using python 3.6.8. \r\nI believe its the past error extract hang on AMD with 8 core, the fix doesn't work on my computer.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nStraight after decompressing and trying the program it splits the video in the images specified but the moment i use extract it does nothing and exits on key pressed, tried extracting through command prompt and does the same thing. Debug shows nothing after method extract.\r\n\r\nPS: After trying a bunch of different things and trying running different versions of python i once got an error message due to numpy not being found even though it was installed to latest version after checking with pip\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700x 8 Core 3.4Ghz\r\nGPY: AMD Radeon RX 580\r\nUsing Windows 10 Up to Date ","closed_by":{"login":"jenarosm","id":51678677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjc4Njc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51678677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm","html_url":"https://github.com/jenarosm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenarosm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
