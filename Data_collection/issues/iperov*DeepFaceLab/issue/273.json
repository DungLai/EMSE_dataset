I tried a simple software that applies USM (unsharp mask) sharpening, it gives outstanding results. I guess you could add such an optional step. Imagemagick or something else should be able to do that.\r\n\r\nAlso, on the latest stage there is generated face that's going to be applied over an original one. Before actually merging it into the original frame, it would be great to sharpen eyes and mouth, it would significantly improve the quality. As a user, I can't sharpen this middle of the face after it's already merged into the frame, but I guess a developer can do so.\r\n\r\n![2019-05-30_17-23-55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/620930/58663455-d6612080-832c-11e9-81f9-d1cc4ec15968.png) - example of USM-sharpening in FastStone Viewer Batch Convert.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
