When src images are collected from a huge variety of sources, lens distortion is quite a big variable.\r\n\r\nI guess todays method is to train with uncorrected images, and then rebuild uncorrected. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know if likeness would be any better if all src images were corrected for lens distortion before you train. \r\n\r\nIn most compositing workflows, you always undistort -> -apply changes -> redistort.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this applies to machine learning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tesla32X","id":48013922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDEzOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48013922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X","html_url":"https://github.com/Tesla32X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
