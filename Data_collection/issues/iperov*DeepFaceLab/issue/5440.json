I think it's a very poor setup for a rtx 3090 with 24gb vram. I remember to train a few months with 256 res  with a older version (that i can't find anymore).\r\nI have 32gb system menory ryzen 5900x and w11 with latest drivers. I only installed th DLF package, nothing more,.\r\nSeems like the lsatr version only uses about 8/10 gb vram.....\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
