It would be future proof until maybe something comes in the future.\r\nCurrent manual vs automatic workflow is PITA cause they exclude one another.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5477/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
