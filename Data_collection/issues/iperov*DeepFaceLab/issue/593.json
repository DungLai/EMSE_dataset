But I've exported DFL masks to Adobe Premiere many times in the past.  I train saehd, then merge saehd.  Click B for 'show alpha mask' so it's just the face on a checkerboard.  Everything is just like it used to be.  I export MOV lossless.  It now creates 2 files just like the changelog said it would.  1 is result.mov which is just the entire video, background and mask together.  And the 2nd one is result_mask.mov and according to the changelog I can put that in as the mask layer....  But I've tried twice now and that layer is just a black background with a completely white mask.  It used to be the face.  Did I miss a step or is something wrong?  Included a screen capture.  \r\nThanks!  (This is with the 1/28 version btw...  Just noticed 1/29 is out.)\r\n![cap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6969681/73410462-2971e580-42b7-11ea-9e1f-e501fe0c70a8.jpg)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/593/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
