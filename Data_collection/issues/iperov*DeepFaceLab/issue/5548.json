At one point I call `Merger.main`, which I expect to succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nI get the exception\r\n\r\n> *** NameError: name 'tf' is not defined\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nMy code had previously called several things. It's a little painful to describe, and I think I know what the problem is and how to fix it, so see below.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\nCalling `Merger.main` causes `nn.initialize` to be called. Apparently it had previously been called. So in core/leras/nn.py, at line 47, `nn.tf` is not `None`, so the code block from line 48 to 115 is skipped. In particular, the _local_ variable `tf` has not been set. So when line 118 is executed (`nn.tf_sess = tf.Session(config=nn.tf_sess_config`) the exception shown above is thrown.\r\n\r\nShouldn't that line be `nn.tf_sess = nn.tf.Session(config=nn.tf_sess_config`, i.e., shouldn't `tf.Session` be `nn.tf.Session`?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
