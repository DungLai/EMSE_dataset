The destination data set was obtained from the same video I planned to convert.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\nIn order to isolate this issue to the convert function and not as simply an issue with the face in the frames of the video, I ran the extraction again on the same video's frames and it properly detected all faces. Because the extract function and the convert functions are doing effectively the same thing at a certain point (identifying faces) and the extraction function works as expected, there must be something wrong with the convert function's facial recognition as it seems to be missing faces it previously had no trouble recognizing during extraction.\r\n\r\nHowever, this may not be an issue at all. If the convert function recognizes the faces for replacement by using the trained model instead of just standard facial recognition, it may be missing the faces in frames because it's simply not trained well enough to recognize them often enough to be reliable. If this is the case, then it's simply an issue with my model not being trained enough and not a real issue. Again, as with my previous issue, I am not entirely familiar with how everything is done in the back end and my issues are likely because of my impatience.","closed_by":{"login":"carson-fitzgibbon","id":22183296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTgzMjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22183296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon","html_url":"https://github.com/carson-fitzgibbon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
