This is due to me doing other workspace work like teeing logs of the program out to the workspace folder and backing up the model at intervals, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't aware, if you run this from a single instance of the command-line you will run into an error after a few runs where the scripts no longer work. I believe this is due to the way the path is set.\r\n\r\nI normally download the new version of builds and modify them every time. I've added other features as well which I COULD submit, but this is the one that I do immediately every time regardless.\r\n\r\nOne of the other features is a user configuration .ini that allows people to override the master setenv values, as well as add their own (for example, if they want to set a base directory and then use that one of the overrides of a value that you use). The new setenv also shows the environment variables read in in a nicely formatted way, as well as fixing the bug I mentioned originally.\r\n\r\nThe latter feature doens't have to be added, or I can make a fork, but it'd be nice to be able to submit the first one.\r\n\r\nI can:\r\n\r\n1) Create my own repository with just the batch files. Upload the patch there and send you the link and you can pick and choose which ones you want, or start using it yourself.\r\n\r\n2) Until you decide what you want, simply upload the fix here for you.\r\n\r\nThanks! I acutally have a bunch of ideas that I think would combine with yours and literally make this into a suite of tools that would make this even more unstoppable and THE ONLY choice for people to use for DeepFakes. Looking forward to your response! \r\n\r\n(Also, sorry about the length. I'd been wanting to ask this for a while and it's just been building up..)","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
