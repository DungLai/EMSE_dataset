Seamless  tends to flicker. When using LAEF or MAEF + Hist match the colors become posterized (like changing bit depth to 256 colors). I tried all options but never got a good result when using histogram match / histogram match bw with AEF models. Seamless  is ok, but flickers a lot. So I did stop testing AEF and go for H128 instead. Did I do something wrong?\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"tfis2","id":45357791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzU3Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45357791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2","html_url":"https://github.com/tfis2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfis2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
