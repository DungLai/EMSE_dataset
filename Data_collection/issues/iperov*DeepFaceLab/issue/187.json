I've tried many different batch-sizes, with and without lightweight auto-encoder, both with the H64 and H128. I get the same issue even when running lightweight with a batch size of 2. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: I run this on the **Linux-fork** (https://github.com/lbfs/DeepFaceLab_Linux) on a **Quadro P5000 (16 GB)** on a **Linux ML-in-a-Box Paperspace** configuration.\r\n\r\nAny idea what the problem could be?\r\nI can't imagine that the lack of VRAM is the actual issue with his card.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1350\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-03-12 at 13 40 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31843785/54201816-e2c4a280-44ce-11e9-9f90-0aea5580882b.png\">","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
