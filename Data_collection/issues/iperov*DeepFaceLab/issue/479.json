It would be fine if it stopped at 3, as that puts me around 18/24 GB VRAM used. But it always goes for a fourth, which pushes me at the border of my VRAM limitations. Once it starts trying to execute it gets hit with CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY issues. Sometimes this will result in all of the extractions being completed eventually. However, more often than not the 1st pass will stop early and continue with those that it managed to complete. 2nd Pass has no Memory issues.\r\n\r\n![DFL Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57318447/68085153-a9e58f00-fe0b-11e9-923f-81487eb917a6.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExecute the \"S3FD All GPU\" or \"S3FD Best GPU\" extractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n-Operating System: Windows 10\r\n-DeepFaceLab Version: DeepFaceLab_CUDA_10.1_AVX_build_10_27_2019.exe\r\n-GPU: Titan RTX 24GB\r\n-CPU: i9-9940X @ 3.3GHz\r\n-RAM: 64 GB","closed_by":{"login":"The-Digital-Void","id":57318447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzE4NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57318447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Digital-Void","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Digital-Void/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/479/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
