I am just letting you know what we are seeing while testing the latest release.  \r\n\r\nMy PC specs:\r\nAMD RYZEN 3900x 12 core \r\n64gb 3400mhz Patriot ram\r\n1 tb WD M2 drive\r\nTwin NVIDIA RTX2060 Supers (8gb Vram each)\r\nOS Windows 10 64bit\r\nNo other programs or antivirus running\r\n\r\n1. Iteration speed - very slow even when leaving the stock out of the gate settings.\r\n\r\n2. Resources - on the latest release we are still seeing CPU fluctuation between 50-100% spikes every 1-2 seconds.\r\n\r\n3. Use able VRAM in Multi gpu - when monitoring both GPU's the VRAM is appears to be only using a max of 35% but very's between each GPU and is consistently \r\nbetween alternating between each GPU 0-10 -25%-35%, this pattern seems to be following a similar pattern as the CPU.\r\n\r\n4.  The option too change resolution comes up after restarting training, dont think this is correct.\r\n\r\n5. On very 1st run the option to save a backup model is bypassed, if training is stopped and restarted you can then save a backup.\r\n\r\nThank you and I look forward to your reply.","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
