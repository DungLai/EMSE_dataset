Only trained to 20,000 iters, but I think it's clear enough.  DFL version 1229 and SAEHD model.\r\n\r\nThe face scale parameters seem to be reversed now.  It used to be positive face scale resulted in upsized (larger) faces.  Now positive face scale makes the face smaller.  Negative face scale numbers makes the face bigger.\r\n\r\nThe two sequential frames used are 00252 and 00253.\r\n\r\nThis is with zero face scale:\r\n\r\n[https://imgur.com/8wEhKPc](https://i.imgur.com/8wEhKPc.gif)\r\n\r\nAlignment seem perfect from frame to frame.\r\n\r\nThis is with negative face scale, making the face bigger:\r\n\r\n[https://imgur.com/zDQ8AbO](https://i.imgur.com/zDQ8AbO.gif)\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a lot of sideways shifting of the face.  The face can end up jittering all over the place when using face scale now.  I'm not sure why.\r\n\r\nI realize in this example, you would not want any face scale at all.  However some models / projects require slight face scale to make it look right.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything is not clear.\r\n\r\nAnd happy new year.","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
