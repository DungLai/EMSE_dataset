(I know this is a low iteration but behaviour persisted up to iteration 10k using my own face)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49677613/61178773-dba5d080-a637-11e9-91d9-f159fa6b4df3.png) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSimply set up and train SAE using default settings, i have confirmed with debugger that the faces from \"extract faces\" are all oriented correctly. Using \"feed by yaw\" doesn't change anything but using \"disable random face flips\" with \"feed by yaw\" does\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\n- **Operating system and version:** Windows\r\n- **Python version:** windows prebuilt lib","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
