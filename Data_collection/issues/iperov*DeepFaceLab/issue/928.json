I am seeing an issue using the sample videos.  Columns 2,4, and 5 of the preview window are either blank or look like noise immediately after or soon after starting the Quick96 training using the GPU option.  The loss value also jumps from an initial value around 3 or 4 to about 10 when the columns start to look like noise and it never comes down.  I have a core i7-6820HK cpu, 32 GB of ram and a GTX980m video card.  Has anyone else seen this issue?  I am using 64 bit windows 10 pro 20H2 with the Windows release from the magnet link.  CPU option works as expected without this issue.
