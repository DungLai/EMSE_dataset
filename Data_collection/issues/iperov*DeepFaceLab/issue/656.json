The dst, src, and output mask all show the extended mask during training and it appears fully trained. \r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I merge the mask is still the default no matter what settings I use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 for merge. Colab for training. Both are using latest 3-7 repo\r\n\r\nEdit: I tried creating an entirely new DST and SRC to use as an example using the 400 eyebrows and it worked fine with a model made after the 3-7 update. I'm going to try re-extracting my original dst I was having issues with. \r\n\r\nEdit2: Just tried re-extracting from the DST and training but it still uses the default mask instead of the extended one. My best guess is that it was because my model was before the automatic learn mask update (my learn mask says \"OFF\" in settings). \r\n\r\nworks with 3-15 update my bad.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"olden529","id":16970807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTcwODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16970807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529","html_url":"https://github.com/olden529","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olden529/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
