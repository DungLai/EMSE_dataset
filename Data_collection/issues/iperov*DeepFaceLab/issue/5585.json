I forgot to remove faces from the destination video and i edited it and \r\ntried extracting it again. It didn't work. Now it doesn't even work for extracting images and face from source.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nI open the  \"data_dst faceset extract MANUAL.bat\" file to extract faces, I enter the information and it just says 0 images found 0 faces found.
