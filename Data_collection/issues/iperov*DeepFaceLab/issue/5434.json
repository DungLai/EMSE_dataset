Some time we have to edit Xseg data and train and again continue with merge. If we have a lot of images to process it will be time consuming to start process from first frame every time. Also all processed frames that are good enough will also get deleted.\r\nI have made changes to Main.py and Merger.py to get selectively process images and felt very useful. But how I can request to make changes in this original code for that feature to be added. I think pull requests are not accepting by iperov as I read somewhere.\r\nBelow is the screenshot of window that resulted from the changes in code.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10379563/143279937-fcd696b7-1c56-444b-9349-445d0d1fa528.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5434/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
