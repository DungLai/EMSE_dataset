How to feed multi-face pairs into the training model?**\r\n\r\nTraining setting:\r\nyou described \"It should be noted that all the videos produced by DeepFaceLab were follow by the same settings with 5.2.\" \r\n**Question 2: How to make it \"The average training time is restrict within 3 hours\" in 5.2? (It might be more clear to me if I know the answer of question 1)**\r\n\r\nResult: \r\n**Question 3:ã€€Table 1 in your paper show the quantitative face swapping results on FaceForensics++. Could I know how to calculate those index: SSIM, perceptual loss, verification, landmarks, pose?
