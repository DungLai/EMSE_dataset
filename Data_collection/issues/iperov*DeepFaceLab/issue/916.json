One of those dirs was the DeepFaceLab directory. Today i wanted to test some ideas within an my first workspace (the one with the initial test files) and just started the \"7) merge\" batch file.\r\nEverything was fine, the UI loaded, i switched with tab-key to look at the frame with mask and tried to change the blur of mask (first action i tried to to).\r\nAn error occured and showed up on console, telling me that the mask file could not be found (e.g. it searched in D:\\ instead of E:\\).\r\nThis was strange because everything seemed to work and show up on UI. However, it seems to me, that there are some different ways used to load the files on some points.\r\nI only observed this on \"7) merge\" batch but it could affect other batches too.\r\n\r\nFurther observation -  sideffects:\r\n\r\nAfter moving the directory back to its old position i tried to continue my work. The merge worked fine now but the \"8) merge avi\" now behaves somhow strange.\r\nI was working with a 29.98 fps video but used the default 25 fps days ago on my first tries without problems. The batch still converted my result to 29.98 fps. Now thinking of it, it has been a strange behaviour. It got even more strange after moving and removing the directory. Because now it suddenly converts the video to 25 fps and i cannot use a float value in the console. It worked just some days ago but how?!\r\n\r\nI hope this was detailed enough.\r\nFor any more informations, please ask anytime.\r\nI will try to help this project, because it realy is a nice one.\r\n\r\ntl;dr:\r\n- moving directory gives \"file not found\"-error afterwards on specific situations and batches\r\n- 8th batch to merge everything cannot receive float values for FPS, but batch converted videos with src FPS days ago without me noticing\r\n\r\nSincerly\r\nMe","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/916/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
