To clarify, it works perfectly fine with a single GPU, this behavior only happens when running duel GPU's. I attempted to run both large 512 models and Quick96 models using a batch size of 1 so its not overloading the VRAM. I also tested this using an old build of DFL that I had on my old hard drive and got the same error.*\r\n\r\n==================== Model Summary =====================\r\n==                                                    ==\r\n==            Model name: YoungZ_SAEHD                ==\r\n==                                                    ==\r\n==     Current iteration: 99189                       ==\r\n==                                                    ==\r\n==------------------ Model Options -------------------==\r\n==                                                    ==\r\n==            resolution: 512                         ==\r\n==             face_type: wf                          ==\r\n==     models_opt_on_gpu: False                       ==\r\n==                 archi: liae-ud                     ==\r\n==               ae_dims: 256                         ==\r\n==                e_dims: 128                         ==\r\n==                d_dims: 128                         ==\r\n==           d_mask_dims: 22                          ==\r\n==       masked_training: True                        ==\r\n==       eyes_mouth_prio: True                        ==\r\n==           uniform_yaw: True                        ==\r\n==         blur_out_mask: False                       ==\r\n==             adabelief: False                       ==\r\n==            lr_dropout: n                           ==\r\n==           random_warp: True                        ==\r\n==      random_hsv_power: 0.0                         ==\r\n==       true_face_power: 0.0                         ==\r\n==      face_style_power: 0.0                         ==\r\n==        bg_style_power: 0.0                         ==\r\n==               ct_mode: none                        ==\r\n==              clipgrad: False                       ==\r\n==              pretrain: False                       ==\r\n==       autobackup_hour: 12                          ==\r\n== write_preview_history: False                       ==\r\n==           target_iter: 200000                      ==\r\n==       random_src_flip: False                       ==\r\n==       random_dst_flip: False                       ==\r\n==            batch_size: 2                           ==\r\n==             gan_power: 0.0                         ==\r\n==        gan_patch_size: 64                          ==\r\n==              gan_dims: 16                          ==\r\n==                                                    ==\r\n==-------------------- Running On --------------------==\r\n==                                                    ==\r\n==          Device index: 0                           ==\r\n==                  Name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060     ==\r\n==                  VRAM: 10.55GB                     ==\r\n==          Device index: 1                           ==\r\n==                  Name: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB ==\r\n==                  VRAM: 4.87GB                      ==\r\n==                                                    ==\r\n========================================================\r\nStarting.
