When I run the Training, my GPU (Vega 56) is boosting every ~15sec. Other than that the usage is only a few percent higher than in Idle. My CPU (Ryzen 5 3600) usage is the same as in Idle. Is that normal? Only my Ram (16gb ddr4 3000mhz) and vram (8gb) are at >90% the whole time. Could the ram be a bottleneck? \r\nI am using the 1.0 Version of the software because I didn't see any downloads of the 2.0 Version for Amd.\r\nGreetings\r\nOle\r\nPS: Because of the low usage the process takes very long as well (<100 Iterations/hour).","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/664/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
