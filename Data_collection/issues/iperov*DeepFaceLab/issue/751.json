It chooses the CPU straight.\r\n\r\nI used to see my Nvidia GT 640 listed, but now that I use a GTX 580 3Gb version, it doesn't work. I don't think the card is too old. What could be the issue?\r\n\r\nProcessor is an i7 3770 with 10gb of RAM.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
