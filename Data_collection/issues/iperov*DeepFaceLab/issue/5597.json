(It seems to speed it up!)\r\n\r\nWhen the set looks good, upgrade the source faceset to a higher quality, and repeat....\r\nAfter sufficient training, it seems that lower quality src and dst give a better likeness.\r\n\r\nI want to train more efficiently without degrading the overall quality.\r\nDoes the overall model degrade if the src quality is lowered?\r\nEqually it's unclear if the dst quality affects the final result.\r\n\r\nI would assume that the src material should be as high quality as possible, and that the dst is not as much of a factor.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts on these questiosn would be well appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
