I was expecting the behavior to continue to run smoothly and train over the night.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nI got this message and I have no idea what it means or how to solve it: \r\n\r\n2022-09-14 00:41:00.440554: F tensorflow/core/common_runtime/dml/dml_upload_heap.cc:56] HRESULT failed with 0x887a0005: chunk->resource->Map(0, nullptr, &upload_heap_data)\r\n\r\nPress any key to continue . . .\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n Nothing happens when I press a key to continue. I found a thread here where a guy wrote that it can be fixed by doing a tensorflow update (in the project). He wrote: Simply go to the folder “DeepFake\\ _internal\\python-3.6.8”, open the terminal, and enter “python -m pip install tensorflow”. I assume that the “terminal” means to open the python application and type in “python -m pip install tensorflow” and press enter. I tried doing this but nothing happens or I am doing something wrong.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n- DeepFaceLab_DirectX12_build_05_04_2022\r\n- Python  3.6.8 (I did not install Python, it was either already installed on the computer or came with DFL)\r\n- CPU Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics\r\n- Windows 10 Home\r\n- 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor\r\n- Processor 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz   2.80 GHz\r\n- Installed RAM 16,0 GB (15,7 GB usable)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
