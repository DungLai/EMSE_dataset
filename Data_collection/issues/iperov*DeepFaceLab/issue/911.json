Noticed 2 new zip files this week on MEGA.  1st one was a couple days ago.  Nothing new in the changelog.  Then it disappeared.  Figured it was a mistake.  Then a newer 9/27 version today and still nothing new in the changelog.  The file size of the zip grew each time, so I'm guessing something is up.  Was it a mistake?  Didn't see anything really new in the code section on github. \r\n Thanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
