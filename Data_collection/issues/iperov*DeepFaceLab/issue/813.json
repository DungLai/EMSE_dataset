And also update the text console's progress on every _Iter_, and  AND possibly every second also. More then half of the text console's status line is empty and can be used.\r\n\r\nAlso can the location of _Iter_ on the preview window can get overwitten in some cases by the graph data.  Can you relocate the location to the top right of the preview window,  there is more than 50% free space there, also it is faster/clearer to find spontaneously.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
