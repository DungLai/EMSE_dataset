Generated faces usually have no film grain, causing face swaps to stand out, particularly if the source video has a noticeable amount of film grain.\r\n\r\nOne solution to this is to intentionally add film grain during merging so that the generated faces have as much film grain as the rest of the scene.  Adding film grain is a common technique employed by video codecs to combat signal loss and make video playback look like the video source.  Here is an example of film grain synthesis employed by the AV1 codec: https://norkin.org/pdf/DCC_2018_AV1_film_grain.pdf\r\n\r\nNote that this is the opposite of the denoising option that exists in the merger.  Rather than removing noise, I am proposing that we add film grain to improve realism.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5599/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
