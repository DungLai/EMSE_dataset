Sometimes the entire shape will never fit, and then it would be great to just grab and move the points.\r\n\r\nAnother thing would be manual placement of keypoints (eyes, nose, mouth) as this will restrict where the remaining points could be located. Just an idea.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the great work.","closed_by":{"login":"Eleganze","id":37071118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDcxMTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37071118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze","html_url":"https://github.com/Eleganze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/70/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/70/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
