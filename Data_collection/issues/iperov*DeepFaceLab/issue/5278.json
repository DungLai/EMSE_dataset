No crash problems prior to trying to use it.\r\nI pretrained a new model with adabelief on (one thing to note is if I started with it on immediately it would crash...  So I had to pretrain with it off for a few iterations (200 or so) and then turn it on and then it pretrained to 300k no problem.\r\nThen I started a new project with the new pretrained model.  Looked great for 2 days.  The graph did have some weird spikes in it, but other than that it was turning out great.  Woke up today and it was completely yellow/red in the right side of the training grid.  Below are my model settings and the training grid/graph once I noticed the crash this morning.  One other quick note, was comparing settings with another person that has had no problems with adabelief.  He's on a 3090...  I'm on an A6000...  Other than that, the only big difference in our environments is he's on linux and I'm on windows.  Also, I'm running off my NAS, not local.  Never had a problem with that in the past either.  So, not either of those factors would matter at all.  Anyway, here's the screenshot.  Thanks for any advice!!! :)\r\n\r\n![image0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6969681/107154722-69879180-6929-11eb-959a-a2cb40862dd0.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
