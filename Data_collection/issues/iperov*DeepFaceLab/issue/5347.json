Has anyone had this issue or can provide a reason as to why the CPU is being so slow with my hardware? Is there a driver I need to install or change a setting?\r\n\r\nthanks ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
