However, it does not proceed from step 4.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an issue with the RTX 3080 right now. As a result of the search, there were packages related to RTX 3k around September. Is it no longer available? Are you preparing for an upgrade?\r\nDeepFace still failed to launch due to GPU issues. We hope the RTX 3080 version will be released soon.\r\nOr let me know if there is a good way.\r\n\r\nBest wishes for a Happy New Year.
