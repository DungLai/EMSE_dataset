I even downloaded the latest files a couple of hours ago and replaced the _internal\\DeepFaceLab content with them but same result.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIt's very easy to reproduce, I'm running \"7) merge SAEHD.bat\" in the Windows binary and I'm changing the output_face_scale value from 0 to a negative value (used to be a positive value to increase the size of the face) and run it on all the frames, and I'm not changing any other parameter that used to work great in the other versions, like the build from 01_23_2020 or before.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\nSame OS as before with the working versions, Windows 10, nothing changed on the system either, just the prebuilt binary.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
