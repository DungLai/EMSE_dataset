Model parameters below, but pattern persists with all training that GPU can handle w/o errors. Extracting and merging frames works fine, even faster than it used to, but training is taking 5x longer than expected. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThis issue persists for all models trained. Steps taken to isolate the issue which have not had any effect:\r\n\r\n - reverted to previous 2021 RTX3000 builds\r\n - turned off hardware scheduling\r\n - turned hardware scheduling back on\r\n - updated tensorflow installation via python console successfully\r\n - Started with brand new model\r\n - Tried different number and size of dst and src images\r\n - Rolled back NVIDIA drivers\r\n - Installed current NVIDIA studio driver using DDU\r\n - Installed current NVIDIA gaming driver using DDU\r\n - Cleared NVIDIA GPU cache/temp files\r\n - General system health checks - DISM, scannow, file check\r\n - Full malware scan of entire system\r\n - Cleaned registry                   \r\n - Used packed & unpacked data_dst and data_src files\r\n - Increased paging file to 100GB\r\n - Allowed system to manage paging file size\r\n - Disconnected all peripherals except for mouse & keyboard\r\n - Turned off/disconnected wired and wireless access\r\n - Turned off all non-microsoft services and programs at startup\r\n - Started in safe mode\r\n - Turned off models on GPU option\r\n - Increased & decreased expected iteration time by varying batch size\r\n - Installed DFL instance on other internal and external SSD and non-SSD drives\r\n\r\nSteps taken which solved the problem: \r\n\r\n- reverted to  August 2020 RTX DFL build                             \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r\nScreeenshots showing model executed:\r\n\r\n![Model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50687096/126853676-136fb49a-08e6-4296-89a1-2320437ff54f.PNG)\r\n\r\nHighlighted on the screenshot:\r\nMost recent iteration time: 624 ms\r\nTraining time between the highlighted times: 7 hours 40 minutes, or 23,995 seconds\r\nTraining iterations during that time: 7,009\r\nAverage seconds per iteration during entire training time: 3.42 seconds\r\n\r\nSystem info:\r\nItem | Value\r\nOS Name | Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\r\nVersion | 10.0.19043 Build 19043\r\nOS Manufacturer | Microsoft Corporation\r\nSystem Manufacturer | Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.\r\nSystem Model | X299X AORUS MASTER\r\nSystem Type | x64-based PC\r\nProcessor | Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10980XE CPU @ 3.00GHz, 3000 Mhz, 18 Core(s), 36   Logical Processor(s)\r\nBIOS Version/Date | American Megatrends Inc.
