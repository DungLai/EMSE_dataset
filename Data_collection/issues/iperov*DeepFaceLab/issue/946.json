For example, the Vgg16 in the applications of keras is used as the feature extractor. However, it is found that there are always errors and the weight cannot be initialized. How can I add the keras layer in your project? Thank you very much.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/946/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
