Especially that i turned off EVERYTHING while training to maximize the VRAM available.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWell, no error is shown. After a random number of iterations (sometimes after 30 sec, sometimes after 3 minutes of training), the preview window just freezes. If i put my mouse over it, it shows the windows 10 loading cursor. And the console, even though it is responding, the iterations don't move. Nothing changes. And i can't quit the training nor close or force close anything. The only choice i have is to either force restart the PC from the tower button, or to wait until it blue screens it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI used the facesets that come with deepfacelab. I tried the models with default options (except the batch size that i reduced in every try, from 8 to 2, and the face type i put wf). I just launch the training process, and everything goes smoothly. Sometimes it saves and backs up. But it randomly freezes and stops responding. No crash messages, no error messages. Just a hard reboot.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\n- I tried all versions of deepfacelab. Even the \"old\" deepfacelab (since it used to work on my PC) yet none of them had a different result.\r\n\r\n- I have a RTX2080 Ti and i already successfully ran deep learning algorithms on it without any problems, the last one being 2 weeks ago.\r\n\r\n- I have 1 TB of free space. And i have enough VRAM to run it. Even with low batch sizes, i wasn't above 50% of my VRAM (11 GB) yet it still crashed and froze my PC. I tried setting a limit in main.py and i cleaned my PC and aired it out. Really nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\n- I have researched this problem for a week now. Noone seems to have the same issue. I found a similar issue which is the issue #334 but he had it during the convert stage and he had an error message. And i tried all the solutions that were suggested in his issue, and none of them worked.\r\nI even turned off quick edit and  insert mode of my command prompt (since i saw that it sometimes causes python to freeze). I will say that it no longer crashes when i use Quick96 but still freezes on SAEHD.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help, and i hope i put all the details that are necessary.","closed_by":{"login":"House1999","id":61945087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTQ1MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61945087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999","html_url":"https://github.com/House1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
