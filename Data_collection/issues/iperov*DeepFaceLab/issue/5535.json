It seemed that everybody was making only color deepfakes(?) which is weird - black-and-white consumes 3 times less data, while it is stylish for portraits and there is less distraction from colors. It could be applied for classic movies as well.\r\n\r\nI was about to ask if anyone had done this modification already or for directions, where to edit, but instead I decided to took the challenge and resolved it myselff: https://github.com/Twenkid/DeepFaceLab-SAEHDBW\r\n\r\nTo exemplify the improved performance, the model for the first test film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2JMGqxOYfA\">\"Arnold Schwarzenegger: The Governor of Bulgaria\"</a> is trained just on a <b>Geforce 750 Ti 2 GB</b> on Windows 10 (it gives only 1.45 GB out of 2 for programs). \r\n\r\nIt is a DFL-SAEHDBW architecture, df-udt mf 192x192 128x48x32x16. It was trained with a batch size of 6 most of the time, in the GPU. It could go 7 or 8, if not in GPU.\r\n\r\nThe files on disk initially are about 345 MB, which seems to be about the maximum size of a model that can be trained on Windows with this GPU(?). Other tested big models were e.g. df-ud 192 128x48x48x16 which resulted in the same size on disk. I pretrained also df-ud 256x96x32x32 281 MB, batch 4.\r\n\r\nSee more info and details in the repository.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23367640/175982252-3d79a921-6261-4fc3-ad56-8737b812b955.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23367640/175983477-be704259-ae9b-41ec-a245-7ea30af6c516.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5535/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
