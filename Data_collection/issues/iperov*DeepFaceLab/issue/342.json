I know for a fact that something like original filename, etc are there, but not for sure.

Reading them as a text does show some extra strings stored tho; but not so much about dict, numbers, etc.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I superbly, dumbly, forgot that it's a frigging GitHub. I can just read the Python files.
