I didnt use to have this issue and I put it down to bad harddrive and low ram. I am now running on a fresh format with 32GB of Ram but I am still having the same issue.\r\n\r\nI have clipped all of my settings, maybe there is something I am doing that is causing this:\r\n\r\nYOu can see where is stopped training the image earlier in the training and it had appeared to come back. But I woke up this morning and it has done it again. Is there something in the settings that I am overlooking causing this model to crash? It has been running for roughly 40 hours.
