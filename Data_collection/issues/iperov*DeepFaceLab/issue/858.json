The graph to stretch horizontally only and the previews to enlarge to fit the vertical limit of the screen. The minimum size should be set to the model resolution.\r\n\r\nThis allows the user to visually obverse how the training preview scales up. Often it would appear that the preview is sufficient only to find during the merge that more iterations or tweaks are required.\r\n\r\n## Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nThe window expands with the graph and pictures docked in the upper right at their respective fixed sizes. The rest of the screen is filled in grey.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExpand the graphical window when performing \"6) train SAEHD.bat\" to observe the actual behaviour.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/858/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
