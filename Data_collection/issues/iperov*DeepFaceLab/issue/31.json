Don't change this option, currently all models uses 'full_face'\"` so training the H128 model, I expect that the full face is used.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nIt seems only a 'half face' is used. \r\nREADME.md says `\"DF (5GB+) - @dfaker model. As H128, but fullface model.\"` which indicates that there is some difference between those two models.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nTrain H128 model with default settings.","closed_by":{"login":"petergerten","id":17756065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzU2MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17756065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten","html_url":"https://github.com/petergerten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/31/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
