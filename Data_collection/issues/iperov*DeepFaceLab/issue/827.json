Furthermore, I tried deleting new _SAEHD_encoder.npy.tmp but it recreated the file everytime I pressed save so I tried removing the permission to manage files from new_SAEHD_encoder.npy.tmp but when I tried to save, there is an error saying that new_SAEHD_encoder.npy.tmp doesn't have permission so I don't know what to do with the file. I also tried the same with new_SAEHD_encoder.npy and it did work temporally before facing the same problem again but this time new_SAEHD_encoder.npy file disappears.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
