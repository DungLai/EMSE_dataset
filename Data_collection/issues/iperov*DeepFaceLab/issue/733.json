My DFL Computer is using a GTX 1050Ti with 4GB of VRAM, so I was going to utilize the Quick96 model. When training, src and dst values do not decrease, right away they go up to values between 9.0-11.0 and stay there. Doesn't matter how many iterations it goes through they stay at that value. Hoping that it was an issue with the build and my computer I downloaded DFL version 4-13-2020. I encountered the same issue. I then attempted Quick96 from my December version of DFL, that also didn't work. However, the H128 model works from December. I cannot test out SAEHD as I do not have enough VRAM.\r\n\r\nI am running on Windows 10, Nvidia Driver 441.20, with CUDA Toolkit 10.2.89-441.22","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
