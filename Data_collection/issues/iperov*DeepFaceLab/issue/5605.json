The problem came when I copied my old model files (with more than 2 million iterations) and tried to train SAED. The program identifies the old model and start loading the samples, but automatically gives me plenty of errors and don't initialize.\r\nDoes it mean my old models are not compatible with the new card and must start from zero?\r\nIs there a way to make it work? \r\nMany thanks in advance.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
