I chose 10.1AVX because:\r\n\r\n    a) My processor supports AVX.\r\n    b) .. Given the choice I would think I would want to use the higher CUDA version.\r\n\r\nBut if it's going to slow down my older card then I, and others, surely would like to know so we can stay at the older CUDA version.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no mention of the 'DeepFaceLabCUDA10.1SSE' builds, even though they are kept up to date as well. I have assumed that these are simply builds that have SSE, but not AVX. Is that correct?\r\n \r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks man. This really is the best Deep Fake solution out there.","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
