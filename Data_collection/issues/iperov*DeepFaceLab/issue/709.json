I do this by entering the following command (my name excluded):\r\n \r\n`python main.py xseg editor --input-dir /Users/[my name]/Desktop/workspace/data_dst/aligned`\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is for all of the images to load and for the interface to open.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe progress bar hits 99% (or some other percentage depending on number of images) and stops.  It appears to successfully load the images, but never progresses to the interface.  However, interestingly enough, when an invalid directory is entered, the interface does appear, albeit without any images.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-09 at 9 28 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32628941/78956826-28c0b100-7aa9-11ea-8a1b-2c51abf2317d.png)\r\n\r\nEven given over 10 minutes, the progress bar fails to complete and the interface fails to show.  No error message is thrown in the terminal, and the application must be force quitted.\r\n\r\nThe following is an image of what occurs when the following command is entered into the terminal, which contains an invalid directory:\r\n\r\n`python main.py xseg editor --input-dir /Desktop/workspace/data_dst/aligned`\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-09 at 9 31 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32628941/78956942-87862a80-7aa9-11ea-878d-c895546f5b71.png)\r\n\r\nDo note that this is taking place in a local Anaconda environment, in which all requirements have been installed at the correct versions via Conda (or pip if unavailable there).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTo fully reproduce this error, use MacOS and attempt to run the first command given (adjusted for your system, of course) on a directory filled with images extracted as \"Head\".  The steps to reproduce the curious result are also detailed above.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely possible that this issue merely has something to do with the fact that I am executing the commands directly from the command line, as I am required to do in lieu of the ability to run .bat files.  Or, it could be a MacOS compatibility issue, seeing as this issue has not appeared for my friends on Windows.  However, I cannot be certain of any of this due to the lack of any error messages or verbose dumping (I have attempted to force it to dump verbose, but those attempts have been unsuccessful; this can be tried again if required).\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n- **Operating system and version:** MacOS 10.12.6 \r\n- **Python version:** 3.7.4","closed_by":{"login":"TalosOfCrete","id":32628941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjI4OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32628941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete","html_url":"https://github.com/TalosOfCrete","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/709/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
