In the latest version, I click B during conversion to set export_alpha_mask to TRUE...  It puts a checkerboard behind the mask as expected...  But when I export by clicking \"converted to mov(lossless+alpha)\" after, like I've done in the past, the final mov file has the background back behind the mask.  Normally it is just the mask and I can import it into premiere as an overlay.  Has anything changed?  Using the same steps I always have.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/541/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
