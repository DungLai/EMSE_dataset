It looks very promising!\r\n\r\nI did some testing after you released this yesterday, and wonder if this is normal behaviour:\r\n\r\nQuick96 is faster on 1 GPU than on 2. (Actually it seems twice as fast in single mode, around 100 ms/it on Gtx 1080ti, but then 220 ms/it when I use both cards)\r\n\r\nWhen running SAEHD with two cards (identical), only memory from 1 card is used. And on average it seems to be using only half of what is available looking on the graph. When upping batch size I still get OOM.\r\n\r\nHere are GPU loads, mem usage etc.\r\n![Gpu mem usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48013922/72985178-adbef700-3de5-11ea-8cb3-88db9a4573a4.PNG)\r\n![GPU usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48013922/72985180-b1527e00-3de5-11ea-99d6-408e67b8c02f.PNG)\r\n![CPU mem usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48013922/72985186-b4e60500-3de5-11ea-8b6f-cedbf0730a76.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tesla32X","id":48013922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDEzOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48013922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X","html_url":"https://github.com/Tesla32X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
