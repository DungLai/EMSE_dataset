There is always some movement somewhere, for example in the eye-areas, or the nose does some random wiggling, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat could cause this?\r\nWhat settings in the encoder have an influence on that?\r\n\r\nI don't want to show a video to avoid copyright problems, so i tried to describe it as good as i can ;)\r\n\r\nI'm running in SAE mode.\r\nI thought that maybe my datasets weren't properly aligned, or sth. like that.\r\nThen i tested the H64 mode for 1 night (30.000 iterations), and even though the face is blurry, the face sticks to the dst face and doesn't jiggle around.\r\n\r\nAlso i have the impression, that when using SAE, the more iterations i run, the more the face jitters around. At 2k iterations obviously the face itself still looks bad, but the movement is more accurate and looks smoother /less jittery then after 100k iterations.\r\n\r\nI use the latest windows build \"CUDA9.2SSE_build_09_21_2019\" in SAE mode.\r\ni think i have tested out a lot of different settings, but did not use any of the \"optimize\" modes yet.\r\nSo with my 4GB gpu i had to somewhat reduce the DIMs, maybe too much?\r\n\r\nHere are my latest settings, maybe you can see if sth. is wrong there.\r\n\r\n============== Model Summary ===============\r\n==                                        ==\r\n==            Model name: SAE             ==\r\n==                                        ==\r\n==     Current iteration: 120746          ==\r\n==                                        ==\r\n==------------ Model Options -------------==\r\n==                                        ==\r\n==            autobackup: True            ==\r\n== write_preview_history: True            ==\r\n==           sort_by_yaw: False           ==\r\n==           random_flip: True            ==\r\n==            resolution: 192             ==\r\n==             face_type: f               ==\r\n==            learn_mask: True            ==\r\n==        optimizer_mode: 1               ==\r\n==                 archi: df              ==\r\n==               ae_dims: 192             ==\r\n==             e_ch_dims: 32              ==\r\n==             d_ch_dims: 12              ==\r\n==            ca_weights: True            ==\r\n==            pixel_loss: False           ==\r\n==      face_style_power: 0.0             ==\r\n==        bg_style_power: 0.0             ==\r\n==       apply_random_ct: False           ==\r\n==              clipgrad: True            ==\r\n==            batch_size: 3               ==\r\n==                                        ==\r\n==-------------- Running On --------------==\r\n==                                        ==\r\n==          Device index: 0               ==\r\n==                  Name: GeForce GTX 960 ==\r\n==                  VRAM: 4.00GB          ==\r\n==                                        ==\r\n============================================\r\n\r\n\r\nAny hint is appreciated ;)\r\nthanks","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/435/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
