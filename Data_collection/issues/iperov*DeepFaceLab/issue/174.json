As I train throughout the day, its helpful to see how much time has passed vs. number of epochs.  That way I can get a rough idea as to how long it will take to hit a certain epoch.  \r\n\r\neg;\r\n```\r\n[2008-09-15T18:53:00] Saving...[#038818][1228ms] src_loss:1.223 dst_loss:0.750\r\n[2008-09-15T19:20:00] Saving...[#039508][1219ms] src_loss:1.129 dst_loss:0.793\r\n[2008-09-15T20:10:00] Saving...[#040195][1252ms] src_loss:0.904 dst_loss:0.657\r\n[2008-09-15T21:25:00] Saving...[#040909][1245ms] src_loss:1.115 dst_loss:0.699\r\n[2008-09-15T22:44:00] Saving...[#041619][1212ms] src_loss:1.044 dst_loss:0.825\r\n[2008-09-15T23:53:00] Saving...[#042334][1209ms] src_loss:1.194 dst_loss:0.824\r\n[2008-09-16T01:35:00] Saving...[#043040][1236ms] src_loss:1.114 dst_loss:0.653\r\n[2008-09-16T02:22:00] Saving...[#043752][1279ms] src_loss:1.023 dst_loss:0.610\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
