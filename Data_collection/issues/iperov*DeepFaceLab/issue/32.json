I have some new images from a video and extract them first. Around half of the frames have a face detected, which is ok. When trying to convert the frames, the output frames do not have the face swapped. The face region in the output frame looks completely untouched.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Pretrained H128 model available.\r\n2. I downloaded a youtube video:\r\n`youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8nkbusv5sY`\r\n3. Extract frames:\r\n`ffmpeg -i input.mkv frame_%06d.jpg`\r\n4. Align\r\npython main.py extract --input-dir /mnt/in --output-dir /mnt/in/aligned --detector mt\r\n5. Convert:\r\n`python main.py convert --model-dir models --model H128 --input-dir /mnt/in --output-dir /mnt/out --mode seamless --aligned-dir /mnt/in/aligned`\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\nSystem: Ubuntu 16.04, requirements installed as described in Linux.md","closed_by":{"login":"petergerten","id":17756065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzU2MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17756065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten","html_url":"https://github.com/petergerten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petergerten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
