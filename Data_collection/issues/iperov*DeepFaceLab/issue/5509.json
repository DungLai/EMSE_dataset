The script (`2_extract_images_from_video_data_src.sh`) is simply:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\ncd \"$(dirname $0)/..\"\r\nsource scripts/env.sh\r\n\r\npython \"$DFL_MAIN\" videoed extract-video \\\r\n  --input-file \"$WORKSPACE/data_src.*\" \\\r\n  --output-dir \"$WORKSPACE/data_src\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe error is as follows:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nFile \"/Users/myusername/DeepFaceLab_MacOS/.dfl/DeepFaceLab/main.py\", line 6, in\r\nfrom core.leras import nn\r\nFile \"/Users/myusername/DeepFaceLab_MacOS/.dfl/DeepFaceLab/core/leras/init.py\", line 1, in\r\nfrom .nn import nn\r\nFile \"/Users/myusername/DeepFaceLab_MacOS/.dfl/DeepFaceLab/core/leras/nn.py\", line 25, in\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have tried all of the suggestions listed in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15424. \r\n\r\nUsing `python -mpip install numpy` yields: \r\n```\r\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /Users/myusername/opt/anaconda3/envs/deepfake_env/lib/python3.6/site-packages (1.16.4)\r\n```\r\nI also receive the same message when I do `pip3 install numpy`.\r\n\r\nI attempted to uninstall/reinstall. It throws an error.
