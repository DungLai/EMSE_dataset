I saw you mentioned Precision.\r\nIs it very certain thing that's impossible to using half precision to train? or any change to use FP16 after?\r\n\r\nAccording to this, I might replace RTX 2080 to 1080TI.  Actually, I donâ€™t really want to take new RTX card for the old GTX card, but I still have to cause rtx 2080's performance is not as good as expected and Insufficient memory.
