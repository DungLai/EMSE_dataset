Training the AI. \r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nCrashing upon attempting to train or merge, BSOD with \"DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION\" Similar to about 1/4 of the posts listed below mine. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTaking two videos, successfully going through steps 1-5 without issue. Extracting faces, manually or automatically. If I attempted any steps towards train or merge, I was met with BSOD. Quick, or any other.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n-2080 ti ROG STRIX Asus\r\n-i7 8700k 5ghz\r\n-32gb ram\r\n-Windows 10 fresh install 1 month\r\n\r\nAfter an hour of reading through the git and forums, I found the ability via underclocking my card and setting limits within the application. \r\n\r\nMy card was overclocked in MSI Afterburner, even without the overclock the system would crash. CPU was reset to standard clock, that didn't help.  Running  only CPU wasnt something I was interested in testing due to time constraints. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98753696/155898797-348b26c7-8725-42da-bdd2-1dfaa25d29cf.png)\r\n\r\nUpon underclocking my memory, core, and power, I was able to maintain a stable outcome. \r\n\r\nI also kept taskers at 8/12? I assume when they ask that its relating either to cores or VRAM. \r\n\r\nI can only assume the application Deepface isn't accounting for my limited VRAM and is using all of it. That seems to be most likely. If thats right, patches should limit the ceiling  VRAM, whatever is maxing out system on the gpu. That, or have heavy warnings for the upper bound.
