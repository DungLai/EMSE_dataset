These model are fantastic.\r\n\r\nBut when it comes to convert, the eyebow area is always make the result unrealistic. See the picture for example. It makes the result looks blur, and makes the edge of the mask visiable and sometimes there are two eyebows.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know changing the value of the 'erode mask modifier' can make it happen. But there are two problems:\r\n1. A single 'erode maks modifer' vaule will not suit for all the shoots because in a video there will be close shoots and other angles.\r\n2. Enlarge this value will make the whole size of the dst mask smaller and sometimes only half eyes or nose wil be converted .\r\n\r\nI know that H128 does not change the eyebow but DF128 and LIAE 128 make the result better. If there is a way to make them skip the eyebow area then these model will be perfect.\r\n\r\nIf you are too busy to make it happen, could you please tell me which part I should look into to make it hapeen and I can try to solve it by myself.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your effort. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kkggken","id":49333401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzMzNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49333401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken","html_url":"https://github.com/kkggken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkggken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
