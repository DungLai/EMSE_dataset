It's difficult to see a trend down towards lower loss when the full histogram is stretched to fit the window, it would be much easier to predict the trend in a model early on if I could see the histogram in this manner. If I knew a model was making very little progress, I could stop and make changes to the data sets or restart entirely with an entirely new model, rather than waiting until epoch 50,000 to see it's not making any progress.\r\n\r\nThis is an image of what I am proposing, where the top is the current model and the bottom is the option I would like to have:\r\n![idea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22183296/50258688-61c1a780-03c6-11e9-9925-40c1dc592ee5.png)\r\nThe end of the second histogram would be determined by --target-epoch, whereas the default (current) example in the first histogram has the end as the most recent loss values reported by the model.\r\n\r\nThis example was created in Paint.NET, if I knew how to do this myself I would have done so and submitted it. This is also not a major issue, just a suggestion for a change in the future.","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/78/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/78/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
