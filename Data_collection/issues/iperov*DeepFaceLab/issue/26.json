I have used the manual tool on all images, which greatly improved result om difficult angles.\r\n\r\nBut it would be very helpful to manually edit landmarks point by point when they are misaligned. Also, it would be great if it was possible to reload a manual edit session, instead of having to start all over every time. Maybe I just misunderstood how it works :)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Eleganze","id":37071118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDcxMTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37071118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze","html_url":"https://github.com/Eleganze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eleganze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
