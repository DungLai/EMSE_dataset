I would expect the merge to output me a 1:00 long video. It produces me a file that says it is 1 min long but it freezes 9 seconds into viewing it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExtracted SRC frames, Extracted DST frames, extracted SRC faces, extracted DST faces.\r\n\r\nRan the Quick86 trainer until I got to 300k iterations. Then I ran quick86 merger and merged all frames. It took quite a while to merge so I know I got all of them merged. When I run the merged to mp4 batch file it outputs me a \"one minute\" long file. When I play it using VLC media player it works for the first 9 seconds than it freezes on a frame for the rest of the video. \r\n\r\nIs there anything else I could try or any more info I could provide? I have spent a few days googling with no results. I have also completely redone the process 3 times.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n- **Command lined used (if not specified in steps to reproduce)**: main.py ...\r\n- **Windows 10\r\n- **Pre Built Windows Binary 2080 or less version.","closed_by":{"login":"Mshriver2","id":3216992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTY5OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3216992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2","html_url":"https://github.com/Mshriver2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mshriver2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
