I didn't even use my own videos for the source, I'm just using what came in the prebuilt windows binary. I can upload my workspace folder if you like so you can see it. My graphics card is a GTX 1060 with 3gb of vram, and that's what I'm using to train. Is it possible that this is caused by not having enough vram?\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n- **Command lined used (if not specified in steps to reproduce)**: I'm running `6) train SAEHD.bat` which opens in the normal windows command line. \r\n- **Operating system and version:** Windows 10\r\n- **Python version:** I'm using the prebuilt windows binary","closed_by":{"login":"anchpop","id":3711047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTEwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3711047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop","html_url":"https://github.com/anchpop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchpop/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/706/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
