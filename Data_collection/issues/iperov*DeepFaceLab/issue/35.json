The **loss value should decrease over training time**, which means a better model and a better quality faceswap.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe **loss value for both faces stagnates**, still after **23 + 8 hours of training**, and iv'e got some error messages about **keepdims** that is deprecated and about memory that could be better used but i dont know how to do that.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nFor the memory, tried to use the Original model training with batch size, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 but i got OOMed every time: LowMem model training works fine with batch size 64. **I dont know whats keepdims is at all**, and for the loss value cant do anything except waiting.\r\n\r\n****\r\n### Other relevant information\r\n\r\n- Windows 10, 64bits\r\n\r\n**Specs :** \r\n- GPU Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 ti 4go\r\n- 16go ram (**never gets over 7go/16go usage dont know why, maybe this influences the model training!!**)\r\n- Intel 7500 smth CPU\r\n\r\n**Useful images + log**\r\n[log training model faceswap lowmem.txt](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/files/2503646/log.training.model.faceswap.lowmem.txt)\r\n![openfaceswap model train settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25486522/47323588-bf52a580-d65c-11e8-82a2-504a5b4fb3e9.png)\r\n![memory usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25486522/47323593-c24d9600-d65c-11e8-848c-c062b2b5dbf9.png)\r\n![gpu usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25486522/47323594-c37ec300-d65c-11e8-8a2d-8a91eca53490.png)\r\n****\r\nSorry for the french text in the screenshots, but i think it's understandable.
