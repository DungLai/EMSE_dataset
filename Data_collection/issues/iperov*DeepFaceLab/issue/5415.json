And this trend continues for a few hours until it gets so slow that there is only 1 iteration in about 20 seconds. Also it just stopped after 5 hours. I let the Xseg training run over night and expected to have well over 50000 iterations the next day but when i woke up there were just 8000 iterations. \r\nI didn't get any error messages and my pc also didn't overheat causing my gpu to cap. \r\nMy gpu was found by the program and, as i said, worked very well at the start. \r\nThe only thing that I can think of that causes the issue is that the HAGS Option doesn't show.\r\n I don't know if that is because AMD doesn't support it yet or if it's my windows Version.\r\nGPU: Amd Radeon RX 6700Xt which I also use for Training. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
