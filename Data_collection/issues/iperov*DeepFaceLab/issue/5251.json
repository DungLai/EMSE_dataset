I've rebooted 3 times.  ;)\r\n\r\nEDIT:  I just tried renaming from the merge SAEHD instead of train SAEHD, and it's working fine from there.  Again, it worked fine from the train app before, too, so I'm really not sure what could have happened to cause this...??\r\n\r\nEDIT 2:  Now I can't rename from either merge or train, and I'm having this same problem on two different computers.  Everything else is working just fine. \r\n\r\nEDIT 3:  In every case, I have eventually been able to rename the model.  I don't know why I can't at some times and I can at others, but if I keep trying it eventually works.  Seems like after it trains awhile it'll eventually let me rename.
