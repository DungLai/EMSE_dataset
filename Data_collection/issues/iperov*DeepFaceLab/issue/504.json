The extracted \"faces\" in the debug folder are just the original pictures, like they we're just copied (they're in 1920x1080) without any masks or alignments even though I marked the aligments in the manual extraction window.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have done everything as usual:\r\n1. Cleared workspace\r\n2. Extracted images from data_src (I should rather say i copied them because I have already extracted them before; also they're in .png)\r\n3. Extracted images from data_dst (in .jpg)\r\n4. Extracted faces from data_src (S3FD best GPU)\r\n5. Checked and deleted some bad results from data_src\r\n6. Extracted faces from data_dst (S3FD best GPU)\r\n7. Checked results in the debug folder and deleted the ones I wanted to manually re-extract\r\n8. Opened the \"... Manual re-extract deleted results debug.bat\"\r\n9. Marked them using mouse, then clicked (they changed to blue and became locked) and then pressed enter and so on. At the end, the window would close and then the second pass which uses CPU started to do it's thing, but I've noticed it does it very quickly (speeds of 80 images per second, i don't know if that's normal)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n- **Command lined used: BAT files that came with DeepFaceLab\r\n- **Operating system and version: Windows 10\r\n- **Python version: Prebuilt Windows binary\r\n- I also used accuracy mode in the manual extraction window","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
