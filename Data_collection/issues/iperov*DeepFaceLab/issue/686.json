I blocked out some obstructions in XSEG and then clicked XSEG)train.bat.  It automatically chooses WF as face type and starts trying to train.  But it's a full face.  Won't let me pick F because it just moves on automatically.  Not sure if it's a bug or I'm doing something wrong, but I've tried multiple times and it does that each time.
