(I know how to enlarge the face, but it is not that problem, the problem is the face_src is in square and too small, if enlarge then it becomes big in square - not a face shape). Attached with the problem photo when merging and the data_src face. Thanks!\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82266096/114267192-eec41b00-9a2c-11eb-9b66-faf8f2a293dd.PNG)\r\n![168275759_4385127121517108_1369924073355071737_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82266096/114267213-f5eb2900-9a2c-11eb-8c5e-5b66e9e3c026.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
