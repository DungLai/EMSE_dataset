It looks as follows:\r\n![err1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18150714/51631532-44e03d00-1f4d-11e9-8602-dfb4182fa4c6.png)\r\n\r\nOk, So I've figured out that the cause might just be a lack of some function in CUDA dll included in this package. The next step I did was to manually check compute capability of my GTX1050 Ti with CUDA, which appeared to be 6.1. Ok then.  I entered that value previously commenting out part of code that caused troubles to be like this:\r\n```\r\n#DeepFaceLab additions\r\ndef nvmlDeviceGetCudaComputeCapability(device):\r\n    #c_major = c_int()\r\n    #c_minor = c_int()\r\n    #fn = _nvmlGetFunctionPointer(\"nvmlDeviceGetCudaComputeCapability\")    \r\n    # get the count\r\n    #ret = fn(device, byref(c_major), byref(c_minor))    \r\n    # this should only fail with insufficient size\r\n    ##if (ret != NVML_SUCCESS):\r\n    ##    raise NVMLError(ret)\r\n    #return c_major.value, c_minor.value\r\n    return (6, 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow error looks like this:\r\n![err2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18150714/51632931-b40b6080-1f50-11e9-86f0-e08ce162b15c.png)\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm running whole setup with this settings (the same function as above):\r\n`...\r\n    return (3, 0)\r\n`\r\nso I can at least run it. In other words it works, but very inefficiently due to engagement of CPU only.\r\n\r\nHere is my question, is there anything that can be done to support GTX1050 Ti? Any help would be appreciated.\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
