However, in the latest release, it's called \"DST\".\r\n\r\nMade me very confused when I followed a video guide and the uploader was describing the \"DST VIDEO\" as the one which provides all of the faces.  I actually left a comment on the video telling that person that the descriptions he used were wrong, before I discovered that it is actually the software itself which is wrong.\r\n\r\n-Rob","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
