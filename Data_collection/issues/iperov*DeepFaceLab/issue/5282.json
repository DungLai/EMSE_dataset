Then it goes to the part that says \"Extracting faces... Running on GeForce RTX 3090\" and it hovers at 0% for a few minutes. Then I get an error message saying \"GeForce RTX 3090 doesn't response. Terminating it.\"\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1) Extract images (this works fine as it uses my CPU I think) from data_src/dst\r\n2) Click 4) data_src faceset extract\r\n3) Default settings\r\n\r\nAnd thats' when the error happens.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\nUsing windows 10. I have done DDU and driver update, clean reinstallation of windows, and I've tested the GPU itself with 3d mark and several games. Whatever the issue is, it's unique to DFL.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
