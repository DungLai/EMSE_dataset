I have tried various batch sizes but the situation does not change\r\n\r\nanother strange things is that during the process the time stats increase from 1000ms up to even 2000ms after a couple of hours (when everythings goes fine with my first problem), is that normal?\r\n\r\nwith these situations seems impossible to leave deepfacelab to work alone without having to check that everything is ok\r\n\r\np.s.\r\n\r\nsince at moment amd with the most recent drivers seems do not support \"GPU Hardware Scheduling\" , is there a drop in performance without being able to enable that option?
