This would be ideal, but caution is needed to ensure this does not interfere with Windows/Colab installations.\r\n\r\nIn `requirements-cuda.txt` set `pyqt5==5.14`\r\n\r\n* Another solution is to use `sed` to modify requirements-cuda.txt to do this post-clone for Linux installation. I am happy to modify requirements file for centos linux if you deem the change too risky.\r\n\r\nI'm not able to submit a PR due to 403 error ðŸ˜ž \r\n\r\nYour view on a way forward would be appreciated ðŸ˜ƒ ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
