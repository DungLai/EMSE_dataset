I just set up everything like mentioned in the doc. Once I did, I started with extracting the face of me. \r\n\r\nBut after 1 hour of extracting (passing first 2 steps), I get this error on the third pass: \r\n\r\n`ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (5,2) (20,2)`\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of the error: https://d.pr/free/i/cFqKtL\r\n\r\nAny idea what could be the reason for this? \r\n\r\nI am running this on Tesla K80 GPU. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. \r\n\r\n**Update:** I created a new instance, re-installed all scripts again and tried to use different images. But I still get the same error. I also tried dlib and mt but both are showing the same error. So any help I could get is greatly appreciated.
