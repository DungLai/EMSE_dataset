This is a great problem for me as it doesn't let me use the second GPU for anything at all.\r\n\r\n![aaaaaaaaaaaaa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52357440/60387918-8354c780-9aaa-11e9-825e-cbb8a97a4f34.PNG)\r\n![bbbbbbbbbb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52357440/60387919-8354c780-9aaa-11e9-882b-f470d815da89.PNG)\r\n![cccccccc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52357440/60387920-8354c780-9aaa-11e9-97df-31e7b730a164.PNG)\r\n\r\nHelp would be very appreciated\r\nThanks\r\nAlex\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
