(before the latest release, i could go up to 30). Now when using RTX titan + 2080 ti in multi gpu, anything above 8 batch size gives OOM. Same as using rtx titan alone.\r\n\r\nSecond issue is that it is going at 8000 ms in multi gpu mode compared to 2000 ms when using rtx titan alone, here's proof. It's using 10/11 gb of 2080 ti, and 17/24 gb of rtx titan. 99% cpu usage, 37,000 mb of ram \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606447508004143124/671755575021010968/Screenshot_284.png\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
