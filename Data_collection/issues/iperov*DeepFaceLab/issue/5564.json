I want to decease the training time for RTM models. I did some experiments but the results are not that good. I had doubts regarding:\r\n\r\n1. Can I increase the learning rate initially (like 8x) and decrease it by half every-time when I delete the inter_AB file ( I delete inter_AB when my loss stops decreasing) ?\r\n2. Can I use multiple GPUs (2-4 ) to increase the batch size and assume that the iterations to delete inter_AB file will also decrease?\r\n3. Is there any other way than the number of iterations to decide when to delete the inter_AB file?\r\n4. Also I am having some wobbling issues with the face when there are extreme camera motions ( like zooming or when the subject comes close to the camera). Does turning off Random Warp after the 4 deletes of inter_AB will decrease this issue?\r\n\r\nI am open for any suggestion to decrease the training time of a RTM model.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
