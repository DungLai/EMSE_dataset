Doesn't even show up in my photos album, just like when it was 265.  Any fix for that?  Tried exporting MOV file as well... \r\n For some reason the iPhone says it's downloading them from my google drive, appears to download 100%, and then there's just no video in the folder.  On older versions I've done this a million times and the video always shows in the photos album and plays...
