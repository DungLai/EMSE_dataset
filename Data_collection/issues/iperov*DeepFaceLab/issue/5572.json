Quick96 works fine, however saehd will not work for me at all. Im using a Ryzen 9 5900x and Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nGetting error after error. Sometimes it gets stuck on the loading sample stage. Sometimes i get a generic crash. Sometimes it says paging file too small.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI tried to increase paging file to 64gb then to 90gb. I tried to use cpu instead of gpu. It gives me a paging file size error. If i use gpu, it gets stuck on sample loading. Ive tried changing driver to studio version, Ive tried decreasing batch size to 4. Nothing is fixing it as of yet. \r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\n- Windows 11","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5572/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
