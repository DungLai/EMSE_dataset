For that I need to generate a .pb file.\r\n\r\nI manage to convert your [2DFAN-4.h5](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/blob/master/facelib/2DFAN-4.h5)  to 2DFAN-4.pb. But I am struggling to make an inference. \r\n\r\nCould you explain me what tool did you use to go from Pytorch to Keras h5 model? That way I can take a detailed look at network, in order to understand what is the input and output tensor names.\r\n\r\nThis is my code for loading the .pb file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef load_graph(frozen_graph_filename):\r\n        # We load the protobuf file from the disk and parse it to retrieve the \r\n        # unserialized graph_def\r\n        with tf.gfile.GFile(frozen_graph_filename, \"rb\") as f:\r\n            graph_def = tf.GraphDef()\r\n            graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())\r\n\r\n        # Then, we import the graph_def into a new Graph and returns it \r\n        with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:\r\n            # The name var will prefix every op/nodes in your graph\r\n            # Since we load everything in a new graph, this is not needed\r\n            tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name=\"prefix\")\r\n        return graph\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my code for running the prediction:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef predict(model, input_image):\r\n        with tf.Session() as sess:\r\n            \r\n            input_layer = model.get_tensor_by_name('prefix/input_1:0') # Input Tensor\r\n            output_layer = model.get_tensor_by_name('prefix/conv2d_194/convolution:0') \r\n\r\n            landmarks_heatmap = sess.run(output_layer, feed_dict = {input_layer : input_image} )\r\n            \r\n            return landmarks_heatmap\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrozen_graph_filename = \"2DFAN-4.pb\"\r\nmodel = load_graph(self, frozen_graph_filename)\r\n2d_fan_output = predict(model , input_image)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
