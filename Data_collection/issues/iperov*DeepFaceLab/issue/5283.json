It freezes after the part where the faces from the src and the dst are done loading and before the model should start training and the preview box should open. I think the fact this works with the 1080ti plugged in narrows it down to something related to the 3080.\r\n\r\nThe program just hangs with no error as if it is getting ready to do something but it just sits.\r\n\r\nI've tried with a few CUDA versions and an older Tensorflow version and the 2.4.0 Tensorflow version and if I remember correctly this hanging after the faces loading is always what happens.\r\n\r\nIs there a straight forward remedy for using DeepFaceLab on Linux with a 3080?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
