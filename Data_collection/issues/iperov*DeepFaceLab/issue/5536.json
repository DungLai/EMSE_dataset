I see this code here:\r\n```\r\n        def process_data(self, data):\r\n            idx, filename = data\r\n            io.log_info(\"process_data: \" + filename)\r\n            dflimg = DFLIMG.load (Path(filename))\r\n\r\n            if dflimg is None or not dflimg.has_data():\r\n                self.log_err (f\"FaceSamplesLoader: {filename} is not a dfl image file.\")\r\n                data = None\r\n            else:\r\n                data = (dflimg.get_face_type(),\r\n                        dflimg.get_shape(),\r\n                        dflimg.get_landmarks(),\r\n                        dflimg.get_seg_ie_polys(),\r\n                        dflimg.get_xseg_mask_compressed(),\r\n                        dflimg.get_eyebrows_expand_mod(),\r\n                        dflimg.get_source_filename() )\r\n\r\n            return idx, data\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the return value `data` does not contain RGB data of the file or am I missing something? DFLJGP has several fields: `img` `chunks` `data` but none of them are used here...\r\n\r\nI'm trying to display some text in the trainer and I thought it would be easiest to modify the images on load for that.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zqueezy","id":2934802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2934802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy","html_url":"https://github.com/zqueezy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zqueezy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5536/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
