Increasing more causes mouth to be too large - go beyond face. Ideally I would need to just increase the size of the top part while not causing at the same time the bottom to be increased.\r\nOr somehow remove/blur the Yoda's (dst) remaining eyes. The only way I can think of right now, is going manually and try to blur manually each photo which is not probably the way to go...\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have attached the photo that shows visually the problem. One can reproduce issue by taking any yoda face and trying to deepfake it.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\nI'm looking for a suggestion from experienced person whether it's possible to deal with this problem in any way (parameter, procedure etc.)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
