im getting this error while im running my own pretrain model, is there any suggestion on what settings should i put, so i will not get the oom error, i know that this gpu is not good, it has 6gb vram but is there any setting that, will be good for results(quality) and also not prompt me with oom ?\r\n\r\ni also tried a pretrained model of an other user but again i got the error, the thing is that the pretrained model was created with the 1060 6 gb which is way worse gpu than mine, and it has the same vram.\r\n\r\n**this is the users one and bellow its mine** \r\n================= Model Summary
