Stop making deepfake porn.\r\n\r\n2) The mole does not appear in other modes because the mask doesn't cover that part of the forehead. If it was on the cheek then it would appear as long as you disabled the horizontal flipping option during training. \r\n\r\nIf you're so inclined you could extract the face landmark locations and add in a \"ie\" poly to show the mole. Look into the DFLJPG module, and the mask editor to get an understanding of how the polys are defined, then do some math based on the existing landmarks, add in the mole poly. \r\n\r\nIt won't be easy but it's very possible.
