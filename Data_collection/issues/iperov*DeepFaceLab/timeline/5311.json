To my understanding, the less the faces are randomly rotated, the better the prediction will be. This proposal simply reduces variance of the extracted dataset, _after_ the face detector extracted the key points of the detected face. It reduces the likeliness that extracted faces are horizontal instead of vertical.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/841388804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stohrendorf","id":7853507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTM1MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7853507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf","html_url":"https://github.com/stohrendorf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stohrendorf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
