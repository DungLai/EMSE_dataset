The important part is to have a model in the end.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know that I downloaded this software from the Linux repo, but how does that gatekeep me from coming to the actual upstream repository? One of the questions in the template is \"Operating system\".

I don't know if you know what Github **issues** is meant for. Its everything else than personal discussions about my proficiency with computers. You can go flex with your python skills to some actual forum to assert your dominance. Just because you made your Github account in 2018 doesn't mean that you are somehow a senior in this field. I saw you mention that in some issue too as an argument.\r\n\r\nI had an issue with the program, and I reported the issue in case someone else has come across is and knows a fix. If that were to happen, others with the same issue could find the fix later. DeepFaceLab is written in python and hence most of the stuff is universal between Linux and Windows. If this project was written in C or some other compiled language, it would be an entirely different case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/992314364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Toasterbirb","id":48382422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48382422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb","html_url":"https://github.com/Toasterbirb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Toasterbirb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1143641698","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5444#issuecomment-1143641698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5444","id":1143641698,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCBuapc5EKpZi","user":{"login":"zabique","id":58276510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Mjc2NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58276510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique","html_url":"https://github.com/zabique","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabique/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T13:52:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T13:52:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Did you fix missing preview window?
