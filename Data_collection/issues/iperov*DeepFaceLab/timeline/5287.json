Also users will not be happy to meet new bugs\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about bugs, and time spent reviewing PRs, then let me assist with the development of a CI/CD (continuous integration) pipeline. I could set up a Github Actions workflow for automated testing, and begin writing unit tests covering the code. This effort would be focused on lowering the risk of future bugs, and saving you time.\r\n\r\nWith a CI/CD pipeline, we could even automate the creation of the Windows distributable, saving you even more time.\r\n\r\nI've built these out for many projects in my main role as a software engineering consultant, and seen the outcomes good CI/CD leads to: \r\n\r\n1. Less time wasted by devs on bugs and process.\r\n2. Less bugs which make ultimately make their way into our client's code.\r\n\r\nThis would be something that would have a long-term, positive effect on the future of DFL, and I'm willing to take the lead on this effort.\r\n\r\n> it is better to discover and experiments with new deepfake methods.\r\n\r\nWith regards to refactoring/code style, I believe that we can make model exploration/development easier with improvements to the overall code structure. Better separation of components/modules will make it easier to test things in isolation. In conjunction with unit testing/code coverage (via CI/CD), it could reduce the effort needed to review PRs for model improvement. \r\n\r\nI want to continue encouraging this project's success, and I believe that improvements like these will have a strong positive effect on:\r\n\r\n- Lowering your workload spent on repository maintenance.\r\n- Raising the quality of outside Pull Requests with automated tests/checks\r\n- Reducing the risk of bugs in the future\r\n- Improving the readability of code, so that more outside developers can assist with model development.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/791784816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmhummel","id":1432270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzIyNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1432270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel","html_url":"https://github.com/jmhummel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmhummel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/791886625","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5287#issuecomment-791886625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5287","id":791886625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTg4NjYyNQ==","user":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-06T07:02:30Z","updated_at":"2021-03-06T07:02:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"as I said\r\nit is better to discover and experiments with new deepfake methods.\r\nConvenient software not so important.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am working on new deepfake-related software with GUI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/791886625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
