Second. batch size 21 seems high, especially with \"models_opt_on_gpu: True\". Even with 24Gb VRAM you are getting OOM errors, I don't think thats a coincidence. Drop the batch size to something like 2 and change to this \"models_opt_on_gpu: False\" and try to reopen the model on GPU. If it opens then you found the culprit. Next, watch VRAM usage in task manager and start turning up your batch size up bit by bit, or try turning on \"models_opt_on_gpu: True\" while keeping your low batch size. Just turn up the model bit by bit until your VRAM usage is as high as you can reasonably go while not going over your VRAM limit. If I'm wrong..........well, we all try to help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1256972679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CodeSmith2000","id":70119302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTE5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70119302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeSmith2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
