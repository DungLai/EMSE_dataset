the merger crashes with a curious error: \r\n```\r\n> Invalid number of channels in input image:\r\n> 'VScn::contains(scn)'\r\n> where\r\n> 'scn' is 5\r\n```\r\nSee full dump and trace below.\r\n\r\nOnly the first merged image is created in data_dst/merged.\r\n\r\nIf I run the merger as non-interactive, the merge is successful.\r\n\r\nThe error seems similar to #645  but that issue is resolved without any solution. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUnable to determine triggers, cannot reproduce in other projects.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\n- **Operating system and version:** Windows 10 \r\n- **Application version:** DeepFaceLab_NVIDIA_build_08_02_2020.exe  \r\n- XSeg trained for 40K iterations  \r\n- SAEHD trained for ~70K iterations with different options along the way\r\n\r\n## Full dump\r\n```\r\nRunning merger.\r\n\r\nChoose one of saved models, or enter a name to create a new model.\r\n[r] : rename\r\n[d] : delete\r\n\r\n[0] : 192 liae-ud -
