Also strongly depends on the model settings, eg the Dimensions, batch size and resolution.\r\nI usually train at least 100k with SAEHD, which takes roughly 100.000x1.0 sec = 27 hours (on Core i7 and RTX2060S) , then do a merge to see whether the quality is good enough. If not, then more train is needed. You can also always monitor the quality in the training preview.\r\n\r\nBut I think these topics are better discussed in the forums mentioned under Links on https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/591504464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wuffenberg","id":60057801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDU3ODAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60057801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/wuffenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuffenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/592194231","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/635#issuecomment-592194231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/635","id":592194231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjE5NDIzMQ==","user":{"login":"jackdancoke","id":49840442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODQwNDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49840442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke","html_url":"https://github.com/jackdancoke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackdancoke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-27T21:49:48Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T21:50:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Es hängt davon ab, wie viel Qualität Sie für die Fälschung wünschen.
