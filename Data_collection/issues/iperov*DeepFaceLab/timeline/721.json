What's new in DFL 2.0?\r\n\r\nAt the core DFL 2.0 is very similar to 1.0 but it was rewritten and optimized to run much faster and offer better quality at the cost of compatibility.\r\nBecause of it, **AMD cards** are no longer supported and new models (based on SAE/SAEHD and Quick96) are incompatible with previous versions. However any datasets that have been extracted with later versions of DFL 1.0 can be still used in 2.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/616106263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"capsmanofficial","id":62510795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTEwNzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62510795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial","html_url":"https://github.com/capsmanofficial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capsmanofficial/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
