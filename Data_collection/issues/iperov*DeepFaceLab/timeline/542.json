Positive face scale amounts result in a larger face, and there isn't the face 'jitter' as shown here.\r\n\r\nOf course the SAEHD model changed between these two versions resulting in an error with a model trained on 1229 but converting on 1215.  Copying the SAEHD model.py from the 1229 version into the 1215 directory seems to work though.  The 1229 model can be loaded by the 1215 converter and face scale works as it did before without jitter.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what changed between the Dec 15 version and the Dec 29 version, but something changed the way face scale works during conversion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/570672741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"titanrw","id":26033165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDMzMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26033165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw","html_url":"https://github.com/titanrw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titanrw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/581220920","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/542#issuecomment-581220920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/542","id":581220920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTIyMDkyMA==","user":{"login":"deepfaceswap12345","id":36651541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjUxNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36651541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345","html_url":"https://github.com/deepfaceswap12345","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepfaceswap12345/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-03T03:24:58Z","updated_at":"2020-02-03T03:24:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm

Expected behavior\r\n\r\nMerging the src face to the dst face used to work great when it came to using the face scale option, (U & J in the interactive merger) either to make the face bigger or smaller, smooth movements and consistent face size.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNow, as previously reported in https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/542 the latest version of dfhd doesn't align the face correctly and is off by a few pixels each frame, creating a jitter when merging to avi or mp4.\r\n\r\nI've tried to correct it by reextracting from scratch the frames of both the source and dest video and extracting the faces on both source and dest as well, but the jitter/misalignment remains, and I'm using a brand new model started from scratch (now rather sharp, at about 300K iterations) with the DeepFaceLab_NVIDIA_build_02_03_2020 windows binaries. I even downloaded the latest files a couple of hours ago and replaced the _internal\\DeepFaceLab content with them but same result.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIt's very easy to reproduce, I'm running \"7) merge SAEHD.bat\" in the Windows binary and I'm changing the output_face_scale value from 0 to a negative value (used to be a positive value to increase the size of the face) and run it on all the frames, and I'm not changing any other parameter that used to work great in the other versions, like the build from 01_23_2020 or before.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\nSame OS as before with the working versions, Windows 10, nothing changed on the system either, just the prebuilt binary.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3174666870,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE3NDY2Njg3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/3174666870","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-28T05:42:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
