best(usage is stable and merge fast).but 3950x : 6 processors  performs poorly.I thought it was processors that affected the ability of 3950x.so I changed the processors of 3950x to 4 and 16, but the result seems to have no logic...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/656983324/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"makichan2000505","id":17851179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODUxMTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17851179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505","html_url":"https://github.com/makichan2000505","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makichan2000505/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/657055233","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/824#issuecomment-657055233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/824","id":657055233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzA1NTIzMw==","user":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-11T12:18:48Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T12:18:48Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"yes
