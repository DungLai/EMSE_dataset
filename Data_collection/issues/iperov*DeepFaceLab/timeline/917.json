I see you're using the interactive merger. Using it I just had the same problem, and I found that the issue was with displaying the image on screen. Processing the whole video without showing it ( `shift`+`>` ) does work for me.  From the stacktrace you provided I see that the Exception occurs in the same location in your case ` cv2.imshow (wnd_name, img)`\r\n\r\nTo patch it up, I just added a try catch in the location where `cv2.imshow` was called and causing an issue. This worked for me, even if I could not see the problematic frames anymore. Which, for me, is fine for now.\r\n\r\n**The (*not quite*) fix:**\r\nFILE: `DeepFaceLab_NVIDIA_RTX3000_series\\_internal\\DeepFaceLab\\core\\interact\\interact.py` -> line `466`\r\n\r\nchange this
