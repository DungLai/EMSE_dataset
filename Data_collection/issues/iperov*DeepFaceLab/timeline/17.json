I don't know if they will work under 2.7, so stick with 3.6. The python error message is telling you it can't find the utils directory in the expected location.  To fix this, you need to put the DeepFaceLab root dir. under whatever root directory you choose, e.g. C:\\DeepfaceLab, and leave all the sub-directories underneath unchanged.   Have you added the DeepFaceLab path to your user or system path?  If you're running Windows 10, download the ready to run install, much easier to get started.
