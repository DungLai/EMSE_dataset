After sorting by similar histogram, check the aligned folder of data_dst and record the number of the wrong or upside down face. (but its hard to find the face which is not detected. For example,  109 110 115 116.  You need to check every number of pictures to find out 111, 112, 113, and 114 are missing .)\r\n\r\n2. According to the record, delete the same number of pictures and those pictures which are not detected in aligned_debug folder. (but Need to check one by one)\r\n\r\nIs it possible to keep original filename after sort by similar histogram in aligned folder of data_dst, like 0001-1124_0?
