mark this as resolved.  I resolved the issue by taking the following actions on one of the impacted Windows 10 machines.  There's probably more than needed here to address the issue but this took care of the issue and now tensorflow recognises the GPU.\r\n\r\n1. uninstalling Python and deleting all the associated libraries under \"C:\\Program Files\\Python36\"\r\n2. reinstalling Python 3.6.0 (old I know but I wanted to use what last worked)\r\n2. uninstalling CUDA 9.0\r\n3. downloading and installing the following - CUDA 11 (cuda_11.1.1_456.81_win10.exe), cudnn (cudnn-11.1-windows-x64-v8.0.4.30.zip)\r\n4. downloading and installing the following - CUDA 10 (cuda_10.2.89_win10_network.exe), cuda_10.2.2_win10.exe, cuda_10.2.1_win10.exe\r\n5. running pip install on all the dependencies in the DFL requirements list for cuda\r\n\r\nRan the following from a Windows command prompt to ensure
