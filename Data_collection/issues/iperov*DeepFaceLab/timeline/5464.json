again for responding.\r\n\r\nNo, I don't have to artistic talent to sculpt manually :) Here is a sample exported from Daz Studio and rendered in Blender.\r\n\r\nI think what I can do is to do two takes, the second with a HMC to capture the actor's facial expression, and track the actor's head with another HTC Vive tracker puck. I won't have the headache of solving to a skeleton, just get the position an orientation, just like I already do to track the camera. I'll also be able to make the Blender scene's lighting match the real world set's lighting.\r\n\r\nI think with that, I'll be able to create an animation that mimics reasonably closely the actual actor, with the correct orientation, facial expression, and lighting. I think this could represent a bare minimum.
