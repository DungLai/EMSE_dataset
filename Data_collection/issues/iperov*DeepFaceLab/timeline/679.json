I was having this issue myself. I was working with 2 GTX 1080 TI video cards and never had a problem with DFL. This week I upgraded to an RTX 3090 TI and immediately started having this error while trying to extract the RTX3000 series file. I followed every suggestion I could find to no avail. I was trying to extract it to the desktop, root folders, external drives, renaming it, nothing worked. So, I decided instead of trying to immediately extract it where I wanted it to go and naming it what I wanted it named, I would just let it place it in its original download destination folder where I had downloaded DFB before extracting anything. Once I did that it extracted the RTX3000 files directly into the original download folder, no errors, installed as intended, now I can manually copy/cut that folder anywhere I want/need it to be. Hope this helps.
