As I see it, It degrades or pixelates the underlaying image, to better match the look of the generated fake. Adjust to 100 and you will see. As for the denoise option, it does the same; Denoise the underlaying image, to better match the noiseless fake. This is probably my best option to solve my problem. Still wish I could do the opposite, and just add noise/grain to the face, to avoid degrading the original.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/586578936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Tesla32X","id":48013922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDEzOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48013922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X","html_url":"https://github.com/Tesla32X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/586579492","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/621#issuecomment-586579492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/621","id":586579492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjU3OTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"Tesla32X","id":48013922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDEzOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48013922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X","html_url":"https://github.com/Tesla32X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tesla32X/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-15T11:11:09Z","updated_at":"2020-02-15T11:11:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Maybe I’m missing something, but why don’t you just apply motion blur?
