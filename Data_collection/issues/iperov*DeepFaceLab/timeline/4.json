Running on just one card increases the odds of success, but it's still very slow. It seems like it's asking for too much memory, but I only have a cursory knowledge of how arcane computer magic actually works, so I'm just guessing. I've read that the RTX cards are currently having TensorFlow issues, but everything has worked fine until now.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of that's changed is that I moved to a new apartment. I checked all the physical connections of my computer, i.e. cards, wires, memory, etc., but everything is nicely seated. Games and movies and general computing work just fine.\r\n\r\nHere's a pastebin of my DxDiag: https://pastebin.com/EBQnePaE\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any
