Also removed both files, started it up, chose a new name and it skipped option with the value set at 0. :/\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a stupid question, but I might as well ask, is the model size set at the beginning?  \r\nI switched over to a GTX 1660 just this weekend and before I was using a RX 560, the difference is night and day (everything was a fresh install). I never understood if the model size increased until took up all the memory or if the settings dictate how much of the \"playing field\" it occupates, so to speak.  \r\n With the RX 560, 1 iteration at lower settings took 8 - 12 seconds, now it's under 1 second at higher settings. Also, it crashed at around 4 - 6K on Quick96 while I discovered it was still going at around 200K on the 1660, at 0,209 seconds / iteration, and I didn't try to go any further,\r\n\r\nThe old file still works, and if all else fails later I can just unpack a fresh version of the app.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/587055045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Misaria","id":58214452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjE0NDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58214452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria","html_url":"https://github.com/Misaria","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
