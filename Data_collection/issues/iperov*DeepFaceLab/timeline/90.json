Maybe I misunderstand, but I have been working a lot with Nuke and Syntheyes where you easily can replace part of a videoframe with whatever you want without visible artifacts. With pixel perfect I mean the tracking of the key features in footage you extract. The current methods used in Faceswap are done on a frame by frame basis. This means you don’t actually track and measure accuracy across the entire footage. This will cause sliding/jittering. The AE can only train on whatever you give it.
