The code resets the iteration counter after leaving pretrain mode so the product of iters are actually there, just not shown in the counter. If pretrain helps ur output or not depends on what you feed it. It helps a little but I dunno how much tbh, as long as you have a good src set to begin with. iperov said while ago that you only need to do it for a few thousand iters not sure if that is true now or then tho.
