Running on just one card increases the odds of success, but it's still very slow. It seems like it's asking for too much memory, but I only have a cursory knowledge of how arcane computer magic actually works, so I'm just guessing. I've read that the RTX cards are currently having TensorFlow issues, but everything has worked fine until now.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of that's changed is that I moved to a new apartment. I checked all the physical connections of my computer, i.e. cards, wires, memory, etc., but everything is nicely seated. Games and movies and general computing work just fine.\r\n\r\nHere's a pastebin of my DxDiag: https://pastebin.com/EBQnePaE\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any

I suspect it might be happening when model is moved to another folder and then copied back to the model folder (SAEHD_default_options file is left in place).\r\n\r\nOn another occasion (just now when I'm editing) I thought that maybe when you move the model files into another folder (instead of leaving them in the model folder and just letting multiple models be there) then starting a new one (that also generate new SAEHD_default_options file) and then bringing one of the previous models back into the model folder it might cause issues but I did just that and now it works so it's really hard to tell exactly why this happens...\r\n\r\nI also tested if changing dfl folder name doesn't have any effect because I changed it - it does not, reverted to the old name (which was DFL 2.0 as opposed to new DFL2.0) and error still happening, fresh model I just started works without issues even after change so that's probably not the case.\r\n\r\nNames of the individual model files weren't changed, also noticed that trying to change a name (in this example I named model 256test1) results in error, example:\r\n\r\nEnter the name of the model you want to rename : 256test1\r\n256test1\r\nEnter new name of the model : test2\r\ntest2\r\nError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"F:\\DF\\DFL2.0\\_internal\\DeepFaceLab\\mainscripts\\Trainer.py\", line 57, in trainerThread\r\n    debug=debug,\r\n  File \"F:\\DF\\DFL2.0\\_internal\\DeepFaceLab\\models\\ModelBase.py\", line 101, in __init__\r\n    model_filename, remain_filename = filepath_name.split('_', 1)\r\nValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nWindows 10 Pro\r\nGTX 1060 6GB\r\ndrivers up to dates (no updates or new installations done before the error started showing up)\r\nDFL 2.0, google drive stable release from February 3rd 2020.\r\n\r\nI hope this can be fixed as it's really annoying and I never know if it's just a random bug or if some update now requires model retraining as the \"cannot reshape array of size 884736 into shape (3,3,128,2048)\" error seems to be typical of situations where models are incompatible. I could also mention issues with odd/broken results of using TrueFace but that's for another issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Misaria","id":58214452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjE0NDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58214452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria","html_url":"https://github.com/Misaria","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Misaria/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-17T13:43:50Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T13:43:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/625","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/625/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/625/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/625/events","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/625","id":566238701,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NjYyMzg3MDE=","number":625,"title":"Auto
