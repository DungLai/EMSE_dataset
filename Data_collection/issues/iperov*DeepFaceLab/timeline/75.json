do you mean seriously? Yes. As I understand it, in order to get alignment data, I have to keep a set of faces extracted from the destination video as well as a set of the same person's faces in the training data, which typically INCLUDES the already extracted destination faces. It's an extra level of workspace complexity and another thing an end user has to do and keep in order. If I were to just use the current extracted dst faces I would have a person's faces both from the video as well as other sources that aren't useful in that particular destination's alignment.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding: the alignment data is the extracted faces from the destination VIDEO, meaning it cannot be destination faces from other sources (like google images). I have a folder of George Bush's face that I use as training data for when I will place my own face onto his. This data is frames from a video of a speech he made as well as many other images of him on the internet. Having to copy-paste or re-extract the faces from the video and putting them in as alignment data means keeping even more images and folders on hand when the program could just as easily re-extract the faces itself from the destination frames, use that temporary alignment data, then delete it when finished.\r\n\r\nOr: let's say I have a model trained to recognize me and an actor. I use it to put my face onto his in a particular movie that I trained it with, it works fine. But now I want to put my face on the same actor in a DIFFERENT movie. Do I have to go through and re-extract, align, and sort through all the faces myself before running the conversion? Why can't it just do it all for me when I tell it to convert after giving it the frames from the video?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/449136425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"carson-fitzgibbon","id":22183296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTgzMjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22183296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon","html_url":"https://github.com/carson-fitzgibbon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carson-fitzgibbon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/449245794","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/75#issuecomment-449245794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/75","id":449245794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTI0NTc5NA==","user":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T04:34:16Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T04:34:16Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"re-extract is suxx and obsolete solution used in faceswap repo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/449245794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
