Or moreover the problem that was the root of it all.\n\nFrom my little knowledge of the files and how it all works, I figured out that the reason it said that \"no training model found\" was because there was no images of the face (training model) in the folder called aligned. They were in Aligned confirmed.\n\nLet me elaborate,\n\nWhen I started the whole process, I went step by step. This is what I did, if you are curious.\n\nStep 1: 2) extract images from video data_src\n\nStep 2: 3) extract images from video data_dst FULL FPS\n\nStep 3: data_stc extract whole_face S3FD\n\nStep 4: I then opened up 4.1) data_src view aligned results to make sure they extracted properly and delete any random inaccuracies. Which I did so. \n\nStep 5: I opened up 4.2) data_src util faceset enhance. Honestly don't know what that does, but i assumed it enhances the extractions, so I let it run. Took around 3 times longer that the src file took to extract. \n\nStep 6: 5)data_dst extract whole_face S3FD\n\nStep 7: 5.1)data_dst view aligned. Checked for inaccuracies and deleted the mistakes.\n\nStep 8: 5.3) data_dst mask editor. This is where all the problems originate from my experience. I made new masks and corrected the faulty ones. Enough for it to train from. Or so I thought. By doing this it placed the images in Aligned confirmed folder. Keep that in mind for later.\n\nStep 9: train SAEHD\n\nName: test\nResolution: 128\nFace_type: wf\nModels_opt_on_gpu: true\nArchetype: dfhd\nAe_dims: 256\nE_dims: 64\nD_dims: 64\nD_mask_dims: 22\nMasked_training: true\nLearn_mask: true\nEyes_priority: true\nLr_dropout: false\nRandom_warp: true\nGain_power: 0.0\nTrue_face_power: 0.0\nFace_style_power: 0.0\nBg_style_power: 0.0\nCt_mode: none\nClipgraddient: false\nPretrain: false\nAutobackup_hour: 0\nWrite_preview_history: false\nTarget_iter: 500,000\nRabdom_flip: true\nBatch_size: 8\nRunning on RTX 2080 TI\nVRAM: 11gb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecs and settings aside, the fact that the images were in aligned confined was the reason that there was no training model available. The images were supposed to stay in aligned folder.￼\n\nAlso if anyone is willing to explain the different architecture, I would be great

few things I noticed while going through your error message.\n\nFor your actual problem, you are running out of VRAM. (Memory) you can see the message yourself at the very bottom of the error code. To meditate this, you need to reduce your resolution from default of 128, down to something smaller. Try 64. \n\nAnother thing I saw while looking through your settings is that you have 0 set for iterations. Set that to something like 150,000. I'm not sure if 0 means infinite until you stop it manually. But in my case I could not stop it when pressing enter so I set a limit of 500k for myself. \n\n\nAnother thing is if you don't do wf (whole face) not while head at extraction, then you'll also get a error. It'll say no training data. \n\nAnyways. For now, try to do the things I mentioned above and let me know how it goes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/780061497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"VictorHermez","id":20391088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzkxMDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20391088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorHermez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorHermez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
