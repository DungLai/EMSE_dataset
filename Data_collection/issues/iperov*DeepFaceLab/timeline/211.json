HWMonitor shows 95 -100% usage at all times but task manager shows less than 20%. I am using an i5 9400f and an RTX 2070. My card runs fine while playing games and shows much higher usage in task manager. I have not installed cuda, cudnn or anything else on my PC except for DeepFaceLabCUDA10.1SSE and latest drivers from nvidia.
