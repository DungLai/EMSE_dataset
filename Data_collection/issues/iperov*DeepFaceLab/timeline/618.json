I fixed few but I'm stuck at one error message and no matter what I change it still happens. Maybe If I would revert to the old version that had just on/off mode for FE would make it work but I'd like to keep both (in fact the best way would be to have Rank as a separate upscaling \"stage\" that can be used with FE or by itself. I won't go back to DFL 1.0 just for this one feature, 2.0 is much faster, it would be counterproductive (at that point it would be faster to just train higher resolution model in the time I can save by using 2.0 instead of 1.0). Unfortunately such modifications are beyond my scope (or rather lack of any, as I mentioned, I don't know how to code).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/586359914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ThomasBardem","id":57501789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTAxNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57501789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasBardem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/587389011","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/618#issuecomment-587389011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/618","id":587389011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NzM4OTAxMQ==","user":{"login":"ThomasBardem","id":57501789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTAxNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57501789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasBardem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasBardem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-18T10:26:14Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T17:33:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've spent few days now trying to get it working without any luck.
