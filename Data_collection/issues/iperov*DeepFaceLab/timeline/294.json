DFLPNG is there and works great, but it's just not used. I patched my repo to use it if you want to take a look at the differences. It's only a few lines to change, all the methods are named the same between DFLJPG and DFLPNG.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that something else breaks with PNGs and that's why it's not enabled, else I'm not sure why they would purposefully sandbag their own project. Having lossless src faces unlocks a lot of possibilities like altering your src faces to match the dst face hue, or sharpening/blurring post-extraction.
