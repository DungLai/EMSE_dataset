Not Exactly But I did find out that this error is generated because of my processor. DFL needs \"AVX or AVX2\" instructions support which my processor didn't had. So I used  DFL colab for everything From extraction to merging of frames And For Xseg I used pretrained Xseg models. But Now I've changed my processor And DFL works Fine. Still I use colab Because I don't have GPU.\r\nSo I guess solution is : you have to upgrade your processor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1185809640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Bhanu1434","id":91895672,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXo3eA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91895672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434","html_url":"https://github.com/Bhanu1434","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bhanu1434/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1186219944","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5402#issuecomment-1186219944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5402","id":1186219944,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCBuapc5GtEeo","user":{"login":"SKEMAM","id":100482597,"node_id":"U_kgDOBf0-JQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100482597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM","html_url":"https://github.com/SKEMAM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SKEMAM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-16T15:32:45Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T15:32:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh.
