I did some research and this is what I did to fix this:\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to \"DeepFaceLab_NVIDIA_RTX3000_series\\_internal\\python_console\" and open the console.\r\n2. First you need to upgrade pip so type in the command \"python -m pip install --upgrade pip\". This should update pip to the latest version\r\n3. Then you need to update tensor flow. Type in the command \"pip install --upgrade tensorflow\" This should update tensor flow.\r\n4. Now to fix the paging file error. You want to follow the steps [here](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html) to change pagefile size. DFL is not installed on the C drive for me though so I had to change the values on the drive I had it installed on. I was able to just leave it on \"system managed size\" but if you are still getting the paging file error you can try manually setting the numbers. If you do it manually you should try setting the minimum to 2 times your RAM and the maximum to 4 times your RAM. For example my minimum would be 64,000MB and my maximum would be 128,000MB (I have 32GB of RAM).\r\n\r\nHopefully this works for you too. If this doesn't work maybe check out [this](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/906) post which was pretty helpful for me as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/833107122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"StickerMouth","id":76426496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDI2NDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76426496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth","html_url":"https://github.com/StickerMouth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StickerMouth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/835953579","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5322#issuecomment-835953579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5322","id":835953579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTk1MzU3OQ==","user":{"login":"rylyguy","id":70399259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzk5MjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70399259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy","html_url":"https://github.com/rylyguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rylyguy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-09T23:58:58Z","updated_at":"2021-05-09T23:58:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It's
