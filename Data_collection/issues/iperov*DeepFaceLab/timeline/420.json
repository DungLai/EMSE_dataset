Only for NVIDIA cards.\r\nThis is a GAN model ported from https://github.com/NVlabs/FUNIT\r\nModel produces near zero morphing and high detail face.\r\nModel has higher failure rate than other models.\r\nIt does not learn the mask, so fan-x mask modes should be used in the converter.\r\nKeep src and dst faceset in same lighting conditions.
