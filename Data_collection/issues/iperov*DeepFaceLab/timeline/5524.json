of all, I want to ask that, theoretically, should 3000 build provide a better performance or not? If not, maybe I will stop trying to figure out how to run 3000 build properly.\r\n\r\nOK, now the description of the problems:\r\nIn general, for training, 3000 build always crashes, and usually with a MemoryError or low paging file message. (There were many times just nothing happened after finished loading samples, I searched the Issues here, it seems most ppl think it's due to low paging file)\r\nI tried to increase the paging file, 32-42G for the C drive, and 32-64G for the drive where the project locate in. (Which is the one the codes really use? The system drive C: in this case?) Only in very very rare case, this works for very light load training like batch size 2 and lowest for all parameters.\r\nThe errors and where the codes crash are different almost every time, the error messages are very similar to #5524 . So I tried his method. by reducing the number of worker, change the Model.py 669 to:\r\ncpu_count = multiprocessing.cpu_count() // 2\r\nI did this to both AMP and SAEHD training codes. The good thing is, the AMP works for most time, but the SAEHD still crashes.\r\nSo for SAEHD, if I start a new model training with a batch size of 2, lowest for all parameters, it can run. But if I increase the batch size to 4, no other changes, it crashes. With DX12 build, I can train with a pretrained model (res: 256, dims: 256/64/64/22) bs=8.\r\nThe followings are images to show that 3000 build only recognizes 5+G VRAM even when the AMP works, while the DX12 recognized 6+ available, and also the latest error message I got when I ran the SAEHD training codes:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-12-10
