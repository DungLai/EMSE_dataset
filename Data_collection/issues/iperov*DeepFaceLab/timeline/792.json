If your problem is the same as I had, then it's not a bug, it's a mistake on step 7, you are not merging the frames with [the \"SHIFT + .\" key combination](https://i.imgur.com/djny77U.jpg), you are just applying the changes to all frames but without merging them. That frame where the video gets stuck, is the frame you were positioned before closing the interactive merger. You have to either manually advance with \".\" until the last frame of the video in the interactive merger, or (easier), press the key combination to do it automatically. If the key combination doesn't work, it might be the language of the keyboard, in that case try changing its language to English, or find where the \">\" character is in your keyboard.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/658553850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Xinomorph","id":68316682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzE2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68316682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph","html_url":"https://github.com/Xinomorph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xinomorph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
