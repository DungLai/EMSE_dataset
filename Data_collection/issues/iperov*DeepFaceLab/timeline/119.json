issue: https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/119\r\n\r\nI get `Error: OOM when allocating tensor with shape` when running the train models (`6_train_H64.sh`and `6_train_128.sh`, same with the \"no-preview\" versions). \r\n\r\n@iperov suggested in the example above of using to use the lightweight encoder and a very small batch size. I've tried many different batch-sizes, with and without lightweight auto-encoder, both with the H64 and H128. I get the same issue even when running lightweight with a batch size of 2. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: I run this on the **Linux-fork** (https://github.com/lbfs/DeepFaceLab_Linux) on a **Quadro P5000 (16 GB)** on a **Linux ML-in-a-Box Paperspace** configuration.\r\n\r\nAny idea what the problem could be?\r\nI can't imagine that the lack of VRAM is the actual issue with his card.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1350\"
