I'd just like to know why it's happening and how I can fix it. I forgot to mention that I did the training on the Google Compute VM and I did the merge on a Google Colab notebook. I think they have slightly different CUDA versions. They do have the same model GPU, though. I tried to do the merge on the Google Compute VM about an hour after I first started training the model and I was getting a different kind of error, so I tried the merge on Google Colab and it worked until now when I'm over 100k iterations into training.\r\nAnother thing I just noticed is that the input directory is set to data_dst on the merge command line. Shouldn't it be data_src?
