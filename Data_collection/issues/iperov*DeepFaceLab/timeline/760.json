However, I and Ctrl+Shift+Face are currently testing it for perceptible quality drop.  In terms of parameter efficiency, however, it seems to approximately halve the parameter counts when placed in the encoder and decoder.  If there is no quality loss, I will initiate a pull request for that too.  If there is, I will implement it as a model option and pull request that.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that S3FD often fails to properly detect faces in more challenging scenes, and that even your more robust landmark detector can - at times - struggle with odd occlusions/shadows.  I have found papers using even more novel techniques than the one you had initially used.\r\n\r\nTell me, though, because Ctrl was complaining about this during his most recent fake: since you said the rectangle was generated by S3FD, then I assume that manual rectangle selection is a substitute for that, correct?  If that is indeed the case, I have found that the manual pass, while quite robust, has difficulty detecting the landmarks on more challenging spots.  Perhaps both the automatic detection algorithm and - perhaps more importantly - the landmark detector could be improved?  I recognize your own improvements upon FAN, but it is still a two year old paper, whereas recent advances in landmark detection have shown exceptionally impressive results (such as [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07399v3.pdf), [this](https://jmbuena.github.io/publications/PRL_2019_web.pdf), and [this](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace); the last one merely implements and improves upon the first paper mentioned) @iperov

I currently have a prototype that uses RetinaFace for the face rectangles and Adaptive Wing Loss FAN for the landmarks.  However, while it functions, it does so in the \"does not throw exceptions\" way.  Put it another way: it runs, but it won't properly find the rectangles for RetinaFace (which is odd; essentially what happens is that it detects over 3000 bounding boxes with low confidence, but last night I was able to get it to detect only two bounding boxes with high confidence) and appears to be centering incorrectly for the landmarks.

Why not?  These algorithms have demonstrably worked, and are empirically superior to the current ones (their papers being found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00641) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07399), with their results and examples pictured below (figures 1 and 2 for RetinaFace; figures 3, 4, and 5 for AWL).  In fact, AWL explicitly states that it is an improvement upon the 2D and 3D FAN architecture you use (figure 6).  In my view, it is indeed worth a look into making it functional in DFL, as it would expand the range of scenes the repository is capable of processing, allowing it to further outstrip its competition from FaceSwap.  In fact, you do mention RetinaFace [in your own paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05535) (figure 7).\r\n\r\nI implore you to examine this  (#767) , as you are substantially more familiar with the face extraction code than I.

Second, the frames I showed (and that you showcased as an awful alignment) were ones that were completely missed by S3FD and FAN, and were exceedingly difficult to get on manual.  In fact, given the original frame, this is actually a perfect landmark alignment.\r\n\r\nFurther, that’s why I added the PR as a draft.  It’s currently a work in progress, but it will soon be integrated properly into DFL, at which point I will do two things:\r\n1. Turn it into an actual PR and request reviewers\r\n2. Release it to major deepfake YouTubers on CSF’s Discord, who may lobby for its addition on my behalf.  You do realize that CSF’s most recent fake would’ve been impossible with just DFL’s normal tools (and the conclusions were merely cracks in a windshield) and the landmarks had to be manually edited with our own, home-brewed software.\r\n\r\nLastly, I see no reason to not use PyTorch in this case.  The models and scripts are already written as such, making implementation easy; further, it boasts no conflicts with DFL’s TensorFlow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/637320081/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TalosOfCrete","id":32628941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjI4OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32628941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete","html_url":"https://github.com/TalosOfCrete","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TalosOfCrete/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3396117711,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM5NjExNzcxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/3396117711","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-02T06:49:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3396117715,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzOTYxMTc3MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/3396117715","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-02T06:49:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/637330592","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/760#issuecomment-637330592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/760","id":637330592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzMzMDU5Mg==","user":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-02T06:58:15Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T06:58:15Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I

Quite harsh.  I just found the reply to be cursory, brash, and uncivil, and believe it warranted the dislike.\r\n\r\nSecond, I did attempt to port the files to TF.

Perhaps you could enumerate your reasons for your insistence on TF-only - as I have found that mixing neural network frameworks very often encounters no problems - and I may respond to them in kind.\r\n\r\nBesides, using the natively trained PyTorch versions ensures consistency in results.  It is the premier framework for researchers, hence the predominant implementations of these algorithms are in PyTorch.  If they are in TF, they quite often don’t include pre-trained models.  Training f one of these myself would require I redactor the code into TF and then follow their training regimen perfectly, while simply using the PyTorch versions allows for the performance of the
