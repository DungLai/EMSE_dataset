Let's say I want to symlink the autobackups folder to Dropbox. In the current version when folder 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 3, all shifting with 24 being deleted, they all have to sync again because of the folders containing different files than before.\r\n\r\nI was just hoping for an incremented system where with each new backup it increments 1,2,3 etc and then could only keep 24 total possibly.
