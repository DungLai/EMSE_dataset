Its a method of randomly warping the image as it trains so it is better at generalization. This is fairly expected behavior to make training more robust, unless it is incorrectly masking your faces after it has been trained and applied to merged faces. This is not a problem unless this translates to the final image that gets rendered out. If it is doing this to the merged faces then just turn off random warping in the model parameters and train for a bit longer.
