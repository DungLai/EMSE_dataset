Unfortunately, after I finished training, I went to break down the new material and found that I couldn't extract the face. I hope the author can solve this problem as soon as possible, even if it is using the CPU, at least\r\n\r\nThat's awesome, not using a pre-trained model or anything? I thought it would need to be updated before utilizing the tensor cores.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/437649722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"frosty3907","id":36653687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjUzNjg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36653687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907","html_url":"https://github.com/frosty3907","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frosty3907/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/437695598","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/43#issuecomment-437695598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/43","id":437695598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzY5NTU5OA==","user":{"login":"gessyoo","id":35972345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTcyMzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35972345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo","html_url":"https://github.com/gessyoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gessyoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-11T19:03:35Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T19:03:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"iperov, it's probably an issue with the current dlib code or CUDA 9 not being completely compatible with the RTX series hardware.
