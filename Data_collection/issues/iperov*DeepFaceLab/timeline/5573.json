I had one model with 30 backups, each taking up several gigabytes. Go to the model folder, select the folders named the same as your model and delete some of the backups that you don't need. You can see the training progress on each backup before deleting so you aren't deleting a backup you might want again. You can find these backups at \"workspace\\model\\NAMEOFMODEL\\\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1297246093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CodeSmith2000","id":70119302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTE5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70119302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeSmith2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
