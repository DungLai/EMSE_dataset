Yes, I guess this could be different technologies.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of generating a mesh instead of \"dead\" pixels sounds intriguing to say it the least. I honestly don't understand how this technology works, so I can't really tell if its currently possible to train for a mesh output. \r\n\r\nIperov has already taken deeepfakes from 128x128 to 256x256, which for sure was a major breaktrough. But we live in a 4k world, and I really don't see how we go further to the next resolution levels anytime soon. I've tried most cards from 16 gb to 32gb configs, and we are not remotely close to bump this up to 512x512 or 1024x1024. Even if we could fit 512x512, the compute time and bs would make this close to impossible - even with the most expensive hardware available. And 512x512 would still look terrible on closeups.\r\n\r\nHowever, If we could get a mesh out - things would look completely different.  (Preferably as an fbx sequence) Then we can use the more established production tools to create fakes on a whole new level. (Maya, 3ds max, Nuke - and even Daz3D as a free option)  The missing details can then be done in the shaders. \r\n\r\nA Hollywood bonus would be that dead people not available for a 3d scan, can still be reproduced without manual sculpting and animation.  Bruce Lee can look alive again in 4k resolution, with true facial features trained from available footage.\r\n\r\nI have worked quite a bit with photorealistic renders, and the mesh itself can be fairly low poly as long as topology is good. Its all done in the shaders. See below - this is quite old stuff, but still very impressive quality wise.\r\n\r\n[Wikihuman
