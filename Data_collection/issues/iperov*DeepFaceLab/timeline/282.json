You would end up with the same problems just a few pixels further from the face border. \r\n\r\nIt should also be said that every additional pixel added to the algorithm will scale training training time in a geometric fashion, not additive. Tweaking the bg style power when training will get you similar results to what you want. Begin around 0.1 and increment slowly through decimals and single digits. I have found this to be especially good at hair/eyebrows. This will get you similar results to your request but not blow out your training time.\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical parts of making a good fake is the choice of src and dst samples. You won't have much luck swapping people that look drastically different. That includes skin tones, imperfections, scene-specific lighting, skin tone, etc.\r\n\r\nI suggest you resolve by hand when pre-processing your dst clip prior to extraction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/500120742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TooMuchFun","id":35074156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDc0MTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35074156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun","html_url":"https://github.com/TooMuchFun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/500120948","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/282#issuecomment-500120948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/282","id":500120948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDEyMDk0OA==","user":{"login":"TooMuchFun","id":35074156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDc0MTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35074156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun","html_url":"https://github.com/TooMuchFun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TooMuchFun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-08T12:36:01Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T12:36:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, please try contributing to the project before requesting features.
