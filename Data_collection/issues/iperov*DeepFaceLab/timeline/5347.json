This is probably because cuDNN failed to initialize\r\n\r\nI saw another solution on github to this was to add the following code:\r\n\r\n“OK, I was able to execute my CNN. I'm using tensorflow tf-nightly-gpu-2.0-preview, and running on a ipython notebook. I had to add this to my notebook:\r\n\r\nfrom tensorflow.compat.v1 import ConfigProto\r\nfrom tensorflow.compat.v1 import InteractiveSession\r\n\r\nconfig = ConfigProto()\r\nconfig.gpu_options.allow_growth = True\r\nsession = InteractiveSession(config=config)\r\n\r\nI’m unsure exactly where to input this, as putting it in the notebook.py file located in the tensorboard folder hasn’t yielded any success\r\n\r\nForever grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.
