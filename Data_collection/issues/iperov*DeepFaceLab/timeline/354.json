you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/527787767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"frrr","id":54721130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIxMTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54721130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr","html_url":"https://github.com/frrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3174666338,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE3NDY2NjMzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/3174666338","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-28T05:41:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
