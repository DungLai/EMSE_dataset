Thanks. Apologies in advance, but I'm not very well versed in this stuff. I saw the link, but it went to a Russian forum site and my browser was having trouble translating, so I didn't want to go clicking random links. I followed steps for manual installation from other discussions & am able to extract just fine. Just trying to get training to work. I had the same issue with the deepfakes repo, that was fixed by installing keras 2.2.0 and keras_vggface, but 2.2.0 doesn't seem to change anything here.\r\n\r\n@oracle9i88 Sorry, I'm not quite sure what to do with this.
