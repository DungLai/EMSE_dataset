I have a model trained on a dst set that comes from a high-resolution video.  Training on the extracted faces from a high-res dst is giving better looking preview images, but converting gives blurry result even with 256res models unless I use lower resolution dst video, but then I have to use extracted faces from that lower-res video and lose details or at least appear to in the preview.  Also, the alignments are never 100% the same as the original extracted faces so it takes a bunch of extra training to try and let things adjust.  I tried resizing the video before converting, but then the original alignments don't work and the merged images either do not have the src face on them, or it's extremely blurry and way off the dst face position.  I assume there is information in the files that links them together for DFL.  I'm trying to figure out a way to make this work.  It seems like it should not be too difficult to implement since it can likely be done with ffmpeg.  I guess if I figure it out I'll share with others who may be interested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/505180233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TheMadFaker","id":51217785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjE3Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51217785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker","html_url":"https://github.com/TheMadFaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/505182843","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/288#issuecomment-505182843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/288","id":505182843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTE4Mjg0Mw==","user":{"login":"TheMadFaker","id":51217785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjE3Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51217785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker","html_url":"https://github.com/TheMadFaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMadFaker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-24T21:11:14Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T21:11:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Basically I'd like to be able to train on dst set from high-res video, which although it is scaled down to a 256x256 face gives more detail than just using extracted faces from lower-res dst, and then at convert when merging be able to choose output resolution of result video.
