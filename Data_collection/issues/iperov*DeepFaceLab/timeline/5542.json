But now when I have done more than 1 million iterations exporting the DFM fails every time with an error message as in the screenshot \"OS error: No space left on device\".\r\nI have 17GB free space on the drive so that sounds a bit strange. Previously I think might had once this problem after 400K iterations when I had some other programs in the background. After closing them it went away, but not anymore.\r\nDoes anyone know why this might be happening or how I could fix it?  \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29117058/188378859-b808acce-35e6-43b0-94f0-03686a5d5910.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1236589166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sebahemm","id":29117058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE3MDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29117058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm","html_url":"https://github.com/Sebahemm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebahemm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
