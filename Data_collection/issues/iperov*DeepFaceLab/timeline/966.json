I have managed to get DFL working on both Tesla T4, RTX 2080Ti and now one RTX 3090!\r\nSorry for the long post, but I thought some bit of what I have gone through might be useful in getting DFL to work on Linux. Has been a nightmare and I've spent days and days on it! But really happy that now got RTX 3090 working!\r\n\r\nI will summarise a few lessons I learned for previous builds of DFL and RTX 2080, and then latest build DFL with RTX 3090:\r\n**General things:**\r\n-use ubuntu 20.04 if possible rather than earlier versions - seemed to have fewer problems with python paths and various other things.\r\n-for cuda versions 10.1, make sure you install cudatoolkit using the conda installer, not \"sudo apt install\" since it is neater and less prone to path problems from within conda. (unless installing cudatoolkit 11.1 in which case you have to use \"apt install\" since conda has not yet released cudatoolkit 11.1, just 11.0 so far)\r\n-make sure your nvidia driver matches your cuda version. Do not have multiple versions of nvidia driver and best not to have multiple cuda versions. Check nvidia driver is working by typing \"nvidia-smi\"\r\n-Also, if having lots of cuda problems / GPU not working in DFL, check cuda from within the conda environment using a tool called Numba by typing:\r\nconda install numba\r\nnumba -s\r\n-A lot of problems with GPU not being recognised in DFL come from Tensorflow problems. If you want to test that Tensorflow is recognising your GPU, Also, to test Tensorflow, open python prompt by typing \"python\", then:\r\n  >>>from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib\r\n  >>>print(device_lib.list_local_devices())\r\n\r\nThis will output your GPU device details if all working correctly.\r\n\r\nNvidia website has all the info on which nvidia drivers work with which cuda toolkit:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.ht\r\n\r\nTable 1. CUDA Toolkit and Compatible Driver Versions\r\nCUDA Toolkit\tLinux x86_64 Driver Version\r\nCUDA 11.1 (11.1.0)\t>= 450.80.02\r\nCUDA 11.0 (11.0.3)\t>= 450.36.06\r\nCUDA 10.2 (10.2.89)\t>= 440.33\r\nCUDA 10.1 (10.1.105)\t>= 418.39\r\nCUDA 10.0 (10.0.130)\t>= 410.48\r\nCUDA 9.2 (9.2.88)\t>= 396.26\r\nCUDA 9.1 (9.1.85)\t>= 390.46\r\nCUDA 9.0 (9.0.76)\t>= 384.81\r\nCUDA 8.0 (8.0.61 GA2)\t>= 375.26\r\nCUDA 8.0 (8.0.44)\t>= 367.48\r\nCUDA 7.5 (7.5.16)\t>= 352.31\r\nCUDA 7.0 (7.0.28)\t>= 346.46\r\n\r\nUsing DFL early Dec build which did NOT yet use tensorflow 2.4, I found that the following worked. This guide will NOT work for latest build but I include it here in case anyone using old builds from 1 month+ ago using tensorflow 2.3 and earlier:\r\n\r\nMake sure you are NOT logged in as root, but instead as a user with sudo privileges. If you are logged in as root, the paths in the env.sh file do not work.\r\n\r\nInstall Anaconda by doing:\r\nsudo apt-get install wget\r\nsudo wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh\r\nbash Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh \r\n\r\nAnaconda should automatically add the PATH if you say yes to the question/prompt about \"conda init\" but to be on the safe side, after install you can enter:\r\nexport PATH=~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\r\nconda init bash\r\n\r\nThen set up conda environment and the dependencies within conda:\r\nconda create -n deepfacelab -c main python=3.8 cudnn=7.6.5 cudatoolkit=10.1.243  [or you can use python=3.7]\r\n conda activate deepfacelab\r\n git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nagadit/DeepFaceLab_Linux.git\r\n cd DeepFaceLab_Linux\r\n git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab.git\r\n\r\nThen edit the requirements-cuda file to change to:\r\nnumpy==1.18.0\r\nh5py==2.10.0\r\nopencv-python==4.1.0.25\r\nffmpeg-python==0.1.17\r\nscikit-image==0.14.2\r\nscipy==1.4.1\r\ncolorama==0.4.4\r\ntensorflow-gpu==2.3.1\r\npyqt5==5.15.2\r\n(if I did not specify a version for pyqt5 or colorama, conda packages install failed on some versions of ubuntu. Version of h5py needed to be slightly newer than in the standard txt file)\r\n\r\nThen finish with:\r\npython -m pip install -r ./DeepFaceLab/requirements-cuda.txt\r\nMake sure you still install these from within the deepfacelab conda environment.\r\n\r\nIf there seem to be problems between tensorflow and cuda, (GPU card not recognised in Training) then try this:\r\nremove the \"conda create\" entries above for cudnn and cudatoolkit and just creat the conda environment with python 3.7 or 3.8. Then when it comes to install the stuff in the requirements-cuda.txt, you can use either tensorflow-gpu==2.3.1 or just \"tensorflow-gpu\", and the tensorflow package installer examined my system and installed the latest tensorflow (2.3 I think it was) and since I did not have cuda installed yet, it also automatically installed the correct cudatoolkit (and cudnn I think). Tensorflow 2.4.0 does NOT yet include cudatoolkit, so it will not auto-install cudatoolkit if it is missing. Remember, Tensorflow 2.4.0 requires cuda 11 or higher.\r\n\r\nIf DFL throws an error that one of the above modules in requirements.txt is missing, try install from CLI using the conda isntall command:\r\ne.g. conda install ffmpeg-python\r\n\r\nThe linux env.sh file used to be wrong for the python version, since it specifies 3.6. Unless you have downloaded the latest files from Nagadit, if using older ones, you need to edit the env.sh file to change this to 3.7 or just \"python3\" (but not 3.6 since this usually throws an error that 3.6 not found), then save. If you install fresh today, this has now been fixed. \r\n\r\nAlso in the env.sh file: \r\non some versions of Ubuntu (not others which were ok for some reason), I had to specify the path to the folders, so for instance: \r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\nexport DFL_ROOT=\"./\"\r\nexport DFL_SRC=\"./DeepFaceLab\"\r\n\r\nyou may need to change to the full path which would be something like: \r\nexport DFL_ROOT=\"/home/YOUR-USERNAME/DeepFaceLab_Linux/\"\r\nexport DFL_SRC=\"/home/YOUR-USERNAME/DeepFaceLab_Linux/DeepFaceLab\"\r\n\r\nPut whatever your linux username is in there instead of YOUR-USERNAME.\r\nI had to do this to get DFL working on ubuntu 20.04 via virtual machine on RTX 3090 with latest iperov builds. Don't know why!\r\n\r\n**Now, importantly moving on to the latest DFL version with RTX 3000 cards:**\r\nI have also eventually got DFL to work including training SAEHD and XSeg.\r\nUse above method but change the conda create step to:\r\nconda create -n deepfacelab -c main python=3.8 (remove cudnn and cudatoolkit entries)\r\nChange requirements cuda.txt file to include \r\ntensorflow-gpu 2.4.0\r\n\r\nGo to Nvidia website and download+install cudnn 8.0.5 (you will have to register for an nvidia account - easy. Use the cudnn version for cuda 11.1).\r\nThen install cudatoolkit 11.1 as per website https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html  \r\nFor my install on ubuntu 20.04, it was:\r\nwget -O /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600 https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2004.pin\r\nsudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub\r\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/ /\"\r\nsudo apt install cuda-toolkit-11-1\r\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.1/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\r\n\r\nDFL should then work on RTX 3090.\r\nHowever, I had an older CPU (Xeon E5-2680) and despite having 16 cores, it could not run DFL. When trying to run training, it would fail at the last line in the DFL script. It would say \"illegal instruction, core dumped\". I found this was due to Tensorflow again. Despite tensorflow 2.4.0 recognising the RTX 3090 (test using the script above), it could not train. This was because Tensorflow checks that the CPU can support AVX or AVX2. Tensorflow 2.3 supports both. Tensorflow 2.4.0 only supports CPUs with AVX2. This was by accident by the staff at Tensorflow. I had to remove tensorflow 2.4.0 and compile my own tensorflow 2.5.0. This worked a charm and I can now train SAEHD and XSeg on the RTX 3090 at good speeds!\r\nIf you need to compile your own tensorflow that is specific to your own machine, follow this link below. It is not too hard but you will need to leave your computer for a few hours to compile.\r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/install/source\r\n\r\nYou should install Bazelisk to help the tensorflow compiling:\r\n$ wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.7.4/bazelisk-linux-amd64\r\n$ chmod +x bazelisk-linux-amd64\r\n$ sudo mv bazelisk-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/bazel\r\n$ bazel version\r\n\r\nI will post this fix for the CPU and DFL on its own too.\r\n\r\nHope all this helps someone out there!\r\nJoe\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/753541843/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Joe-121","id":76885018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODg1MDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76885018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121","html_url":"https://github.com/Joe-121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-121/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4162044353,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE2MjA0NDM1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/4162044353","actor":{"login":"TheGermanEngie","id":75632861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjMyODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75632861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie","html_url":"https://github.com/TheGermanEngie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-02T23:13:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4162044354,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNjIwNDQzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/4162044354","actor":{"login":"TheGermanEngie","id":75632861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjMyODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75632861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie","html_url":"https://github.com/TheGermanEngie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheGermanEngie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-02T23:13:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/966907142","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/966#issuecomment-966907142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/966","id":966907142,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCBuapc45odUG","user":{"login":"GraysonChang","id":93960371,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZm4sw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93960371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang","html_url":"https://github.com/GraysonChang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraysonChang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-12T08:13:39Z","updated_at":"2021
