have this happen almost every time I create a new model. I've had this happen on 1060 and 3060. The model parameters are usually very strenuous on my system and for some reason when creating a model they are much harder on the system than normal operation would be. What I usually do when CREATING a new model is to create it on CPU. Using the CPU is generally more stable and less prone to this kind of behavior. Once I create the model and save it, then I can reopen it with GPU and it is much more stable. It may take significantly longer to create on CPU, but its a one time operation anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1256964872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CodeSmith2000","id":70119302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTE5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70119302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeSmith2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeSmith2000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
