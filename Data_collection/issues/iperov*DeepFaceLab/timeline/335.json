(I tried with S3FD first, and got an import error, so I thought you might also have tried it with S3FD)\r\n\r\nyou can confirm how to do this? i don't want extract 2000+ faces manually, i just extracted 600 and took like 20 minutes :C\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/521537257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ozamatheus","id":46179564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTc5NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46179564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus","html_url":"https://github.com/Ozamatheus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ozamatheus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/521587390","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/335#issuecomment-521587390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/335","id":521587390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTU4NzM5MA==","user":{"login":"XerneraC","id":10479930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10479930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC","html_url":"https://github.com/XerneraC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T09:56:26Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T09:56:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> you can confirm how to do this? i don't want extract 2000+ faces manually, i just extracted 600 and took like 20 minutes :C\r\n\r\nI'm not currently at home, so I can't give you exact instructions. I can try though:\r\nIn the folder, where all the .bat files are located. Find the step 5 \"data_dst extract faces MT.bat\" (I'm not sure on the name)(Probably works with the src extraction .bat files as well, but I didn't change them, so I can't guarantee). If you right-click it and choose \"edit\", you can edit the .bat file. There you will see a list of arguments (they start with 2 dashes). By adding \"--CPU-ONLY\" to the arguments, you should be able to extract the faces from the images.\r\n\r\nI'll probably be able to help you better if you give me the contents of the .bat file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/521587390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"XerneraC","id":10479930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10479930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC","html_url":"https://github.com/XerneraC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XerneraC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/521618191","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/335#issuecomment-521618191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/335","id":521618191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTYxODE5MQ==","user":{"login":"Deimos00","id":54141534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTQxNTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54141534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00","html_url":"https://github.com/Deimos00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deimos00/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T12:04:57Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T12:04:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"same problem\r\n\r\n> > Performing 1st pass...\r\n> Running on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

open then file\r\n\r\n**DeepFaceLab_OpenCL_SSE\\\\_internal\\DeepFaceLab\\mainscripts\\Extractor.py** and change the line **305** from\r\n\r\n`no_response_time_sec = 60 if not self.manual and not DEBUG else 999999`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n`no_response_time_sec = 600 if not self.manual and not DEBUG else 999999`\r\n\r\nafterwards, run the extract batch files again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/557803913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kadrim","id":8304331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDQzMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8304331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim","html_url":"https://github.com/kadrim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"kadrim","id":8304331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDQzMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8304331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim","html_url":"https://github.com/kadrim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-24T10:09:19Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T10:09:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/286/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/286/events","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/286","id":458649099,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTg2NDkwOTk=","number":286,"title":"Face
