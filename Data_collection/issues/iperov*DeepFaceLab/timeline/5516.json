There are preprocessings of the images on each iteration anyway, in order to align the landmarks, to apply warps etc. \r\n\r\nActually I think if the target resolution would be 224x, you could rather resize (reextract) your faceset to lower resolution for that training, because that may increase the performance in this domain (reading and preprocessing the images), however I don't know how big the difference would be. You could test it with training partial facesets only with 224x224 and only with 768x - e.g.: place them in different directories, edit the batch file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1124217397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Twenkid","id":23367640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzY3NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23367640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid","html_url":"https://github.com/Twenkid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twenkid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
