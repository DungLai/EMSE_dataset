After few days, started to work again, btw, i've installed the latest drivers for 1050 TI, they was probably outdated for any reason, and it just started to work again with the new release.\r\n\r\nBy the way, i've noticed that i missed speed. It may doesn't make any sense, but the interactions are more slower that before, before the problem (and start to work again). Any clues?\r\n\r\nThanks!!!!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/748437213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Versury","id":75974943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTc0OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75974943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury","html_url":"https://github.com/Versury","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Versury/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
