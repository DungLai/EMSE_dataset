I know you made a few changes to this, so maybe I'm doing something wrong... But I've exported DFL masks to Adobe Premiere many times in the past. I train saehd, then merge saehd. Click B for 'show alpha mask' so it's just the face on a checkerboard. Everything is just like it used to be. I export MOV lossless. It now creates 2 files just like the changelog said it would. 1 is result.mov which is just the entire video, background and mask together. And the 2nd one is result_mask.mov and according to the changelog I can put that in as the mask layer.... But I've tried twice now and that layer is just a black background with a completely white mask. It used to be the face. Did I miss a step or is something wrong? Included a screen capture.\r\n> Thanks! (This is with the 1/28 version btw... Just noticed 1/29 is out.)\r\n> ![cap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6969681/73410462-2971e580-42b7-11ea-9e1f-e501fe0c70a8.jpg)\r\n\r\nHi, I wanted to know how to do this too and after some digging the tutorial below tells you how ....\r\n\r\nhttps://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-luma-matte-transitions-premiere-pro--cms-30584","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/584334229/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"turnip26","id":56805175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODA1MTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56805175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26","html_url":"https://github.com/turnip26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turnip26/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
