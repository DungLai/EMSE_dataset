RIP.\r\n\r\nYou can try to copy over individual .h5 files with the same steps and try to save as much data as possible, but I don't think it's worth your time. For the next run:\r\n- If you have the HDD space, use model backups. If you had backups you could just revert to a previous save and keep training.\r\n- Turn on clipping from the start, it's worth the tiny slowdown.\r\n- Increase your batch size, the default when you select 0 is hard coded to 4 right now. Increase it until you get OOM errors at launch, then reduce it by 2 (you can try reducing by 1 but it might OOM later).\r\n- Unless you only have 4GB of system RAM, use optimizer mode 2. It lets you use some system ram as vram so you can increase your batch size more. If you have 16 or 32GB you can try 3 but it's slow. YMMV. \r\n- Use CA weights. It makes your setup slow but you gain the time back during training, plus other benefits. It's good stuff.\r\n- Triple check your faces.

IS NOT TECH SUPPORT FOR NEWBIE FAKERS\r\nPOST ONLY ISSUES RELATED TO BUGS OR CODE\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI launch the training (SAE or Quick96) with minimal parameters and i expect the training to run smoothly. Especially that i turned off EVERYTHING while training to maximize the VRAM available.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWell, no error is shown. After a random number of iterations (sometimes after 30 sec, sometimes after 3 minutes of training), the preview window just freezes. If i put my mouse over it, it shows the windows 10 loading cursor. And the console, even though it is responding, the iterations don't move. Nothing changes. And i can't quit the training nor close or force close anything. The only choice i have is to either force restart the PC from the tower button, or to wait until it blue screens it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI used the facesets that come with deepfacelab. I tried the models with default options (except the batch size that i reduced in every try, from 8 to 2, and the face type i put wf). I just launch the training process, and everything goes smoothly. Sometimes it saves and backs up. But it randomly freezes and stops responding. No crash messages, no error messages. Just a hard reboot.\r\n\r\n## Other relevant information\r\n\r\n- I tried all versions of deepfacelab. Even the \"old\" deepfacelab (since it used to work on my PC) yet none of them had a different result.\r\n\r\n- I have a RTX2080 Ti and i already successfully ran deep learning algorithms on it without any problems, the last one being 2 weeks ago.\r\n\r\n- I have 1 TB of free space. And i have enough VRAM to run it. Even with low batch sizes, i wasn't above 50% of my VRAM (11 GB) yet it still crashed and froze my PC. I tried setting a limit in main.py and i cleaned my PC and aired it out. Really nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\n- I have researched this problem for a week now. Noone seems to have the same issue. I found a similar issue which is the issue #334 but he had it during the convert stage and he had an error message. And i tried all the solutions that were suggested in his issue, and none of them worked.\r\nI even turned off quick edit and  insert mode of my command prompt (since i saw that it sometimes causes python to freeze). I will say that it no longer crashes when i use Quick96 but still freezes on SAEHD.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help, and i hope i put all the details that are necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
