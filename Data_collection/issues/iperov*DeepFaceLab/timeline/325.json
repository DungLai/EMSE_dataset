But first I'm going to ask you to put more effort into your future tickets. Remember you are asking random people for advice, please make an attempt to meet us halfway and make a decent post.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed a few of these out there, my current favorite is TacoTron2 + Waveglow. In this setup TacoTron2 generates the \"faked\" mel-spectrograms, and then Waveglow turns those into audio. You have to train both models so it's a bit of an endeavor, but the results are not bad.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2\r\n\r\nBeyond this there are papers describing models that use & create audio along with faces. I do not know of any publicly available implementations of these.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/518087517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Auroir","id":36361058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzYxMDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36361058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir","html_url":"https://github.com/Auroir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3174666216,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE3NDY2NjIxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/3174666216","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-28T05:40:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
