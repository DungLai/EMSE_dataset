- It seems that the 3090 is slower to start, and it runs in \"chunks\", but overall it actually is faster than my 2060 SUPER.\r\n\r\nSo this is odd.  It seems to be a mirage now that I'm looking at this more closely.  I have two machines I'm working with here.\r\n\r\n* Intel i9 10900K w/ RTX 2060 SUPER\r\n* AMD Ryzen 9 5950X w/ RTX 3090\r\n\r\nI'm extracting from a clip with 23,840 frames.  I prepared the same clip on both machines, and I hit ENTER at the exact time on each to start the extraction process.\r\n\r\nThe 2060 gets started much more quickly.  It was about 200 frames in before the 3090 even started running.\r\n\r\nAlso, the 2060 goes at a nice, regular flow.  You can watch the frame counter move along, and while sometimes it will go a little bit more quickly and then slow down again, it never stops completely.\r\n\r\nThe 3090 will run for a little bit, then stop completely, then run for a bit more, stop, etc.  When it runs, though, it will run through quite a few frames much more quickly.\r\n\r\nOver time, though, the 3090 has caught up to the 2060, and has surpassed it.  As of this writing my 2060 is at 7200 frames while the 3090 is at 7500 and pulling away. \r\n\r\nThe it/s jump around quite a bit on both, but they seem to have settled at about 2.51it/s on the 3090 while the 2060 is showing 2.39it/s.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to provide the additional feedback.  I guess I'm going to go ahead and stick with 3090 for extraction after all.  I had been using the 2060 for that and then transferring for training, but that seems to actually be slower overall.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/774396928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"testerson34","id":77367399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzY3Mzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77367399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34","html_url":"https://github.com/testerson34","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/774569514","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5243#issuecomment-774569514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5243","id":774569514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDU2OTUxNA==","user":{"login":"testerson34","id":77367399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzY3Mzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77367399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34","html_url":"https://github.com/testerson34","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/testerson34/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-07T01:03:53Z","updated_at":"2021-02-07T01:03:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Info I'm getting elsewhere says that with CUDA v11.1 it introduces the stuff necessary to take full advantage of RTX 30 series.

The current version of Tensorflow only supports 11.0, I believe.\r\n\r\nIn order to use CUDA 11.2, you must compile Tensorflow with CUDA 11.2 and CuDNN 8.1. I encountered a similar problem with Faceswap when trying to use it with CUDA 11.1, and I simply swapped out the Tensorflow that came normally shipped with it with a wheel compiled for CUDA 11.1. \r\n\r\nI have yet to try the same thing with DFL.
