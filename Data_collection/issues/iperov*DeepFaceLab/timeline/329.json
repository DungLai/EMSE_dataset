Remember on Win10 you can only use about 85% of your vram, if you want to use all of it you need to dualboot into something else. So I'm using about 7GB of vram with these models. Also I prefer LIAE simply because I've had better luck with it, feel free to explore your options.\r\n\r\nMy favorites:\r\n**SAE-LIAE 176px, Full face @ 200/40/20**\r\nI run this with a 10 batch size (you can up the batch size when style is set to 0) but you should be able to do a few higher. This is a slower one since batch size is under 16, but it's not terribly slow like something with bs of 6.\r\n**SAE-LIAE 192px, Full face @ 192/32/14**\r\nI liked this one for a while but the decoder with only 14 dimensions didn't work out well on some faces. I ended up replacing this with the 176px one above.\r\n**SAE-DF 256px, Full face @ 400/38/19**\r\nThis is the biggest model you'll want to run. I think it was batch size 4 for me, you might get 6 out of it with optimizer mode 3. It's going to take a week to finish, but if you really want 256x256 output, this is the one. \r\n**SAE-LIAE 128px, Full face @ 222/34/16**\r\nTiny model. Makes quick ones at a batch size of ~24, but only 128x128px output. If you are willing to resize your destination to 720p or lower this works surprisingly well. Especially if you export with alpha and do some light post-processing. \r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that the iterations required to get a good results increases as batch size decreases. With batch size of 6 I shoot for 150k iters. With 12 the goal is 100k iters, and 24 gets 50k. Do not train with a batch size above 32, it becomes too generalized and your results will suffer for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/520099729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Auroir","id":36361058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzYxMDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36361058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir","html_url":"https://github.com/Auroir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Auroir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/520102302","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/329#issuecomment-520102302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/329","id":520102302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDEwMjMwMg==","user":{"login":"unknownentity123","id":40390544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzkwNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40390544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123","html_url":"https://github.com/unknownentity123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unknownentity123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-10T00:29:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-10T00:29:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Auroir What are the parameters represented by the X/Y/Z to the right of the @ symbol in your descriptions?

My suggestions here are just things that worked for me, the best models will always be the ones you tune to your specific machine.\r\nSee #334\r\n\r\n**Style**: Yes, style is key to making colors match and faces not shake. Train until your face is completely crisp, even if the colors look wrong. Then enable Face & BG style, start with 0.4 & 0.2 respectively. Train for another 5k-10k iters. If you need more then increase until you get what you want. **Never use this until the face is very clear!**\r\n**Color Transfer**: (FYI, not random, it's 100%) This all depends on your src/dst. It transfers all the colors, even background colors. So if you have a src face on a black background and a dst face on a green screen, all the green is going to end up in the face. I just try it for a second and check the preview. If the src faces look inhuman then obviously I turn if back off. If you can use it then go for it, but it only works on about 30% of my projects. And again wait until your face is clear. \r\n**Clipgrad**: Use it, I can't notice the slowdown and if it saves even one project from collapse then it's 200% worth it.

trained a model with the following settings to ~85k iterations. The model settings i'm using are based off of the post made here https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/329 and can be seen below. In this post @Auroir mentions that for a batch size of 6 (this is the best my GPU can handle) I should shoot for ~150K iterations. What I'm not understanding is why I'm getting model collapses and super low loss values starting at ~60k iterations ( I back up my models so I was able to recover from 2 collapses and get another 25k iterations out of it.)\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that the result of a seamless learned hst match conversion looks quite good for destination images at medium ranges but the closeups still look very blurry. I was thinking that more training would get the closeups better but as you can see in the image below the loss values are really low and are improving little if at all over more iterations.\r\n\r\nGiven the context above I have a few questions...\r\n1. Why are the loss values so low this early, given 150K iterations is recommended.\r\n2. Why is the model collapsing this early?\r\n3. Why are the closeup images so much blurrier than the medium shots?\r\n4. Does this all just point to bad a source set?\r\n\r\n# Model Settings:\r\n== Model name: SAE\r\n== Current iteration: 82708\r\n== Model option\r\n== |== batch_size : 6\r\n== |== sort_by_yaw : False\r\n== |== random_flip : False\r\n== |== resolution : 176\r\n== |== face_type : f\r\n== |== learn_mask : True\r\n== |== optimizer_mode : 3\r\n== |== archi : liae\r\n== |== ae_dims : 200\r\n== |== e_ch_dims : 40\r\n== |== d_ch_dims : 20\r\n== |== multiscale_decoder : False\r\n== |== ca_weights : True\r\n== |== pixel_loss : True\r\n== |== face_style_power : 0.0\r\n== |== bg_style_power : 0.0\r\n== |== apply_random_ct : False\r\n== Running on\r\n== |== [0 : GeForce GTX 980 Ti]\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54478726/64311981-0edf4e80-cf5b-11e9-8944-ce2467a588bc.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3174666222,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE3NDY2NjIyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/3174666222","actor":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-28T05:40:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
