TBH you make it sound like you just dropped it in and like magic, it worked.. that's simply not the case..  I've managed to get it mostly working but I just don't have the time to dedicate to it, I've been a coder for 22 years.. he has a valid question/request.. I happen to agree that it would be nice to have it back and I do in fact maintain two versions for now but I know that won't be feasible for long.  It's not about lazy, it's about optimizing my time, convenience, and also the mere fact that fanseg works pretty effectively as is.  What would be great is to make these models more modular, a great system would be one where you could download DFL core and then download the rest as plugins..   Bottom line though, just because you prefer xseg doesn't mean everyone does, and just because others prefer fanseg doesn't mean you do.. it's that simple.  So no need for anyone to insult others.\r\n\r\nSecondly I agree that fanseg would be nice to have back, it works pretty well and it's hands off almost every time, no need to manually draw a mask unless you're doing something more complex, I am quite familiar with xseg.. I would still prefer having the option, as would a lot of others.. I've seen it come up in questions on forums and now here..  no need to be mean about it.. \r\n\r\n@rlkiran seriously, no need for all caps yelling and cussing.. really not necessary at all.. You're not going to get any help if your going to respond in that way, trust
