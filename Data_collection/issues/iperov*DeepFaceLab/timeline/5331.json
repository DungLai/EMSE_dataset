images were degraded and generated by the code with degrade.py in Face-Renovation repo to represent or emulate problematic pictures in real life.If I understand it right,DeepFaceLab also have some ways to degrade images with sample generator or loader to deal with those images and faceswap them as a final result.But when I used these degraded images in dst,and high resolution images in src,some of the pictures handled well like bicubic degradation and some of the images didn't do good.That means your sample generator covered that method,but not others. \r\nIf DeepFacelab can understand more degraded images and knows how to restore them by looking at high resolution pictures in src folder like FFHQ set,so we can have a True restoration model. It shall act like Remini or DFDNET.\r\n\r\nThat is why I asked if you can implement or add some more methods like in degrade.py of those 2 repositories. \r\nI am hoping I made it more clear this time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/841797716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FlowDownTheRiver","id":71787427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzg3NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71787427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver","html_url":"https://github.com/FlowDownTheRiver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlowDownTheRiver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/841798338","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5331#issuecomment-841798338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/5331","id":841798338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTc5ODMzOA==","user":{"login":"iperov","id":8076202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8076202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iperov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-16T10:32:51Z","updated_at":"2021-05-16T10:33:01Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"> DeepFaceLab also have some ways to degrade images with sample generator or loader to deal with those images\r\n\r\nonly for XSeg trainer.\r\n\r\nFaceEnhancer (based on Topaz AI) is enough for most cases.
