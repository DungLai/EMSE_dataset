I'm unclear on how they are distributing those CUDA cores, if it's show to the system as a unified device (think GTX1080 8GB) then that's ok, but if it's spread across multiple devices (think K80 24GB) then it's going to be slow on top of slow.\r\n\r\nObviously it has to support all the CUDA device calls.
