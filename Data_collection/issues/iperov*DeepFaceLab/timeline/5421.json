I'm talking about resizer inside dfl, which is not related with any kind of upscaler or enhancement.\nAnyway it's basically impossible to train a model with resolution higher than 640, u need too much vram. Actually u could change the code to change the maximum res, but if it is 640 there is a reason.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/963989437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cioscos","id":36228780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjI4Nzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36228780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos","html_url":"https://github.com/Cioscos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5588523772,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCBuapc4-C-9uzwAAAAFNGhr8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/5588523772","actor":{"login":"Cioscos","id":36228780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjI4Nzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36228780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos","html_url":"https://github.com/Cioscos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-09T09:56:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5588523780,"node_id":"SE_lADOCBuapc4-C-9uzwAAAAFNGhsE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/5588523780","actor":{"login":"Cioscos","id":36228780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjI4Nzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36228780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos","html_url":"https://github.com/Cioscos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cioscos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-09T09:56:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
