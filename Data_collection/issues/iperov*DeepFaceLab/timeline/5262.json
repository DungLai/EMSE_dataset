So that means NVIDIA. Recommendations should be decided by how deep your pockets are. If it's just for deepfaking, and not gaming, a used GTX1080Ti would be fine. It's 11GB, cheap, not that much slower vs more expensive RTX 2000 cards. More vram means higher model specs, but more cuda cores means it will train faster. So if you are also a gamer, a new RTX 3000 series with 10+ GB would be great at both. But expensive... And depending on your computer, you might need to change a lot of hardware.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/768229720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NvrTdp","id":77741794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzQxNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77741794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp","html_url":"https://github.com/NvrTdp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NvrTdp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
