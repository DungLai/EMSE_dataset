We had an unexpected power outage in the neighborhood. Of course..)\r\n\r\nHere is a version which fixes the bug. It also simplifies the logic for the for statement that does the version checking for CUDNN since Windows XP and the versions after it check different. It also removes the need for the 'v' variable so the calling environment isn't polluted unnecessarily. Finally, it exits the batch file with an ERRORLEVEL of 0, which is like C-like in that it represents a success. This would allow you to do stuff like:\r\n\r\ncall _internal\\setenv.bat && echo This executes on success. || echo This executes on failure.\r\n\r\nAlthough I know you don't do that currently.
