Another machine of mine with the same configuration does work totally fine. I'm not sure why my second machine doesn't want to train. \r\nAnyway, a small fix to start training at least is to manually reduce the amount of cores the SAEHD model uses while training.\r\nThis can be done by replacing `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` in line 669 of `\\DeepFaceLab_NVIDIA_RTX3000_series\\_internal\\DeepFaceLab\\models\\Model_SAEHD\\Model.py` with a fixed number e.g. 8 to use only 8 cores.\r\nThis helped at least to get the training started. I'm not quite sure if there is a fixed limit on multiprocessing... Also some more dynamic approaches like reducing the cpu_count by one ( `multiprocessing.cpu_count() -1`) didn't seem to work.\r\nMore investigation is needed, but this could be a first starting point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1263512189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cglukas","id":48561400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTYxNDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48561400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas","html_url":"https://github.com/cglukas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cglukas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7495090303,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCBuapc5DGeCDzwAAAAG-vgB_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/7495090303","actor":{"login":"dflguru","id":99176396,"node_id":"U_kgDOBelPzA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99176396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru","html_url":"https://github.com/dflguru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-30T12:30:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7495090306,"node_id":"SE_lADOCBuapc5DGeCDzwAAAAG-vgCC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/events/7495090306","actor":{"login":"dflguru","id":99176396,"node_id":"U_kgDOBelPzA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99176396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru","html_url":"https://github.com/dflguru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dflguru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-30T12:30:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
