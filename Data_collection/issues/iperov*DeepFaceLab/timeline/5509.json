This project requires Python 3.7.  This is set in Conda environment, and also in env.sh script.  because the python version is set in the script to use \"python3.7\" it will override the conda environment and develop a mismatch and use the native python3.7 environment.  If you upgrade your native environment to 3.7 you can resolve this issue. (or it seemed to resolve the issue for me.)  It's possible this issue would also be resolved by setting env.sh to \"python\" as this would use the conda environment python instead.(Strictly speculation as I did not try it.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/1142518381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mattAndruff","id":26882428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODgyNDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26882428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff","html_url":"https://github.com/mattAndruff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattAndruff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
