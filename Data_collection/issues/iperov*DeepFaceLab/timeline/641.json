Please take a look and do comment about my code modification to have the average duration of every iteration.\r\n\r\nI did this: create three variables that are reset every training session. As it is now, everytime you restart a model, these variables will reset, so there is no global averaging by now.\r\n\r\nThese variables are:\r\ntime_sum = total time since last reset.\r\ntemp_iter = iterations since last reset.\r\naverage_time = time_sum divided by temp_iter.\r\n\r\nI have modified the information line, so it now includes three fields with those variables:\r\n\r\nAVG: average_time\r\nPT: time_sum (PT = partial time)\r\nPI: temp_iter ( PI= partial iterations)\r\n\r\nHow do I publish the patch for Trainer.py for you to test?
