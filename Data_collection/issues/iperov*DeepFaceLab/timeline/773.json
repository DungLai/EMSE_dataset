However, by allowing 110% power on my pc and underclocking by 150 (through msi afterburner), i got SAEHD to work for like 4-5h without freezing every time with a batch of 2. With a batch of 8, it freezes right after the 1st 15 min auto-save. \r\n\r\nI think, as u said, there's a problem related to RTX. But i am changing my PSU today, hoping maybe it will help with this issue too. I will let you know if i get any results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/644714936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"House1999","id":61945087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTQ1MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61945087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999","html_url":"https://github.com/House1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/House1999/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/comments/644742081","html_url":"https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/773#issuecomment-644742081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iperov/DeepFaceLab/issues/773","id":644742081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDc0MjA4MQ==","user":{"login":"HappiestCow22","id":66987400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTg3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66987400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22","html_url":"https://github.com/HappiestCow22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappiestCow22/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T12:50:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T12:50:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I train overnight I would usually underclock my gpu a bit as well to keep temperatures down and that did help for a while.

Weird.\r\n\r\nFinal results : I just swapped my old PSU (corsair RM750x) for a corsair RM1000x (because i found one for the same price as a RM750x) and i kept the same settings we discussed before (underclocking by 150 and keeping the temperature limit at 84 C and closing every program). \r\n\r\nI can say that SAEHD runs smoothly (For now) with a batch 8. I noticed that my MHz and temperature stabalized (it used to move a lot before chaing the PSU). However you need a lot of fans in the pc to keep it cool (i have 3-5 fans outside of GPU fans). But for now, this seems to be a good fix. Maybe you should try it if you're still into deepfakes !
