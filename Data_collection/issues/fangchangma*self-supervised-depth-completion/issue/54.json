I just have one question regarding to your training setting. \r\nIn the paper, you used photometric consistency between current frame and next frame as the cue for self-supervised training. \r\nBut following similar idea, if using a stereo pair can accomplish such supervision as well by maintaining the photometric consistency between left & right image, right? \r\nHave you try training in such way? I think it is computationally cheaper. \r\nI am looking forward to your reply. \r\n\r\nBest, ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
