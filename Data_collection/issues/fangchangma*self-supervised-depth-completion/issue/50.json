I didn't change any hyper parameter from your code, just the batch-size is smaller than you mentioned (8).\r\n\r\nAre there any parameters or options I need to change from this Github repo? Or do you have any suggestions on training?\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nZiyue Feng","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
