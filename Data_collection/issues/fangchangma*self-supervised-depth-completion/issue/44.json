So my question is  \r\n\r\n1. Is my understanding of rgb_curr_ and warped_ correct? If not, I hope to get your corrections. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Why use the current frame and predicted neighboring frame images to calculate photometric_loss, instead of using the current frame and predicted current frame to calculate photometric_loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. In your paper, I have seen guidance on using RGB images for depth prediction, Is it the only way to calculate the photometric_loss using the RGB guide? If not, I hope you can give me your advice.  Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just come into contact with this knowledge, and there may be something wrong. I hope you forgive me. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks for the help!
