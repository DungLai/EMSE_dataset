When I read the paper, I met a question about chapter 6 On Input Sparsity. \r\n\r\nIn figure 6 you show the result when you trained with self-supervised framework, 'using both RGB and sparse depth yields the same level of accuracy as using sparse depth only'.\r\n\r\nCould you tell me  if the following guess is correct?\r\n\r\nWhen we have only LiDAR sparse input, we have only 'depth Loss' and 'Smoothness Loss' during training. And Network Architecture in Figure 2 only have 32 channels LiDAR input.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my guess is right, The input of your paper is Degenerate to the same as Sparsity Invariant CNNs(Only LiDAR). But in this case, your network gets better results. So how do you prove that it is the reason for Self-Supervised framework or Photometric Loss function, not because your network is optimized for lidar?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!","closed_by":{"login":"AbnerCSZ","id":24248188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ4MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24248188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ","html_url":"https://github.com/AbnerCSZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerCSZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
