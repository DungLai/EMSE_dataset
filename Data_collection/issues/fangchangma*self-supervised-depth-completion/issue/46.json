For some strange reason I get the following error:\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 210.00 MiB (GPU 0; 10.91 GiB total capacity; 8.95 GiB already allocated; 194.06 MiB free; 9.59 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch)\r\n\r\nHow can I avoid this? When I dont run your code the GPU usage is low (approx 500 Mb). Looks strange that a 11 Gb GPU is not enough for your code.\r\n\r\nI use the following command:\r\n\r\npython3 main.py --evaluate /home/username/Downloads/model_best.pth.tar --val select\r\n\r\nI have nothing changed in any file.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"oconnor127","id":54242789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjQyNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54242789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127","html_url":"https://github.com/oconnor127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oconnor127/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
