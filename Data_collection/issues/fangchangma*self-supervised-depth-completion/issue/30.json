I am trying to evaluate the method on our own dataset. We gathered larger images and thus have to crop/resize them. When looking at the code, the comment in kitti_loader.py states: \r\n\r\n> note: we will take the center crop of the images during augmentation\r\n    # that changes the optical centers, but not focal lengths\r\nhttps://github.com/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/blob/master/dataloaders/kitti_loader.py#L29\r\n\r\nThe optical center is then adjusted. However, in lines 145 and 168, a bottom crop is applied to the images. Thus, if I understand the code correctly, the full crop distance has to be subtracted from the focal centers.\r\n\r\nCan you check if my understanding in this regard is correct?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nChris","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
