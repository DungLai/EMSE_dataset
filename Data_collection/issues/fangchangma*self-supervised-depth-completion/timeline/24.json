@fangchangma I mean this warning will appear when the batch size is set to 1 or 2, so I think if the small batch size will lead to a bad result. What do you think the minimum size of the batch size is set to get good results?\r\n\r\nHi, I also get the warning. Dose it actually affect the final result? And do you know what is the proper batch size?\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/comments/605557870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"longyangqi","id":13297107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjk3MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13297107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi","html_url":"https://github.com/longyangqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longyangqi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3175575342,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE3NTU3NTM0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/events/3175575342","actor":{"login":"fangchangma","id":17073991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDczOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17073991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma","html_url":"https://github.com/fangchangma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-29T04:38:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3175575343,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNzU1NzUzNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fangchangma/self-supervised-depth-completion/issues/events/3175575343","actor":{"login":"fangchangma","id":17073991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDczOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17073991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma","html_url":"https://github.com/fangchangma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangchangma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-29T04:38:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
