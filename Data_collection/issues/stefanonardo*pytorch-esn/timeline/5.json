Take a look at the file. The second column is one step ahead the first. Why would you change it?\r\n\r\nWell, in file mg17.csv it can be seen that first column is some numbers different to each other. Second column is all consists of same numbers all over again \"1.236445196138708791e-01\". You are sending these 1.236445196138708791e-01 to Y, then sending it to your model and getting just the same result in the output \"1.236445196138708791e-01\". So it was obvious to me that it's somehow wrong. What the point to send array of \"1.236445196138708791e-01\" to model getting same \"1.236445196138708791e-01\" array as output and getting 0 error? So i thought that second column is delta X and first column is Y. And because of that i've changed those columns. And with that assumption it is possible to get graph like green on pictures but not possible to get normal predictions.
