JingliangGao,\r\n\r\n1. We set the first hidden state to zero, therefore the initial internal states of the reservoir are really biased from this initialization and do not provide useful information. For this reason, it is a common practice to discard an arbitrary number of steps. See \"\"A Practical Guide to Applying Echo State Networks\" for a better explaination.\r\n\r\n2. I do not entirely understand your question. Do you want to see where is the \"deep\" feature inside the code? Here, the implementation of the deep ESN is the same as the PyTorch's implementation of deep RNN. The difference is that we collect the output of each layer (reservoir), not just the last one, since, at the end of the training, we need the state of each reservoir.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Lorenz timeseries, if you can share code and dataset, or at least the dataset, I could tell you if something is wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/comments/475209775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stefanonardo","id":11474759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11474759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanonardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/comments/475470135","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/7#issuecomment-475470135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/7","id":475470135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTQ3MDEzNQ==","user":{"login":"JingliangGao","id":32430057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDMwMDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32430057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao","html_url":"https://github.com/JingliangGao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JingliangGao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T02:16:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T02:22:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Stefanonardo,\r\n     Thanks for your prompt reply and help me solve the Q1 that I mentioned above. \r\n     1. Yeah, I want to see where is the \"deep\" feature inside the code, but find nowhere. Specially, to make the structure be deeper, we can collect the output of each layer (reservoir), so where can this be reflected in your code?\r\n     2. For Lorenz  serialized data prediction, I will send the dataset to you mailbox stefano_nardo@msn.com. BTW, I use the time delay method to train and predict Lorenz  serialized data, but the loss  does not converge. Do you have any great idea?\r\n\r\nIt will be appreciate if you provide more detials.
