On the front page you will notice that I added a parameter for classification tasks, namely `output_steps`.\r\n\r\nBefore this update, you had to pass a target value for each timestep of the timeseries, i.e. size had to be (timesteps, batch, feature). Now, if you pass 'mean' or 'last' to  `output_steps`, your target's size must be (1, batch, feature). \r\n\r\nIn the feature I will add some examples, both for regression and classification.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/comments/387250803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stefanonardo","id":11474759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11474759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanonardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1614200048,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYxNDIwMDA0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/events/1614200048","actor":{"login":"connectedhealthcaremy","id":18474982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDc0OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18474982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy","html_url":"https://github.com/connectedhealthcaremy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-08T00:53:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1614200049,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MTQyMDAwNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/events/1614200049","actor":{"login":"connectedhealthcaremy","id":18474982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDc0OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18474982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy","html_url":"https://github.com/connectedhealthcaremy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connectedhealthcaremy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-08T00:53:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1778484152,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc3ODQ4NDE1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stefanonardo/pytorch-esn/issues/events/1778484152","actor":{"login":"stefanonardo","id":11474759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11474759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanonardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanonardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/
