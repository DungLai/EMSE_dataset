The algorithm indeed works to some extend, but after trainning for about 1500 steps (each step has a mini-batch of 256), the agent seems to stop learning and just chooses almost the same action and makes the same mistake. \r\nI fund that in AlphaGo Zero's paper, the MCTS parameters such as \"c_puct\" is optimized by Gaussian process:\r\n\r\nMCTS search parameters were selected by Gaussian process optimization, so as to optimize selfÂ­-play performance of AlphaGo Zero using a neural network trained in a preliminary run. \r\n\r\nI am not familiar with Gaussian process, in my implementation, the c_puct is a constant. I wonder how do you deal with the c_puct, and how gaussian process is applied to this scenario.
