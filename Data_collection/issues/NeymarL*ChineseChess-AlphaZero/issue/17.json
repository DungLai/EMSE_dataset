It's not clear to me from the bit in the paper:\r\n```\r\nAdditional exploration is achieved by adding Dirichlet noise \r\nto the prior probabilities in the root node s0, specifically \r\nP(s, a) = (1 − ε)p_a + εη_a, where η ∼ Dir(0.03) and ε = 0.25; \r\nthis noise ensures that  all moves may be tried, but the\r\n search may still overrule bad moves\r\n```\r\nbut it seems like this is something you can do just one time in the root node, then keep the same noise for all 50 or 100 or 1600 searches.","closed_by":{"login":"NeymarL","id":12618657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE4NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12618657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL","html_url":"https://github.com/NeymarL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeymarL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NeymarL/ChineseChess-AlphaZero/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NeymarL/ChineseChess-AlphaZero/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
