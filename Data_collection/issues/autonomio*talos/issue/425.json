I closed the previous same-named issue by mistake ---still open\r\n\r\nHello,  just recognised that the Analyze object's column names do not match the content of the params dictionary...see the examples below:  I've ran an experiment with the following params:  \r\n\r\np = {'optimizer': [Adam, Adamax, Nadam, Adagrad, Adadelta], 'first_neuron': [5120, 1024, 512, 128, 64, 32, 16], 'batch_size': [100, 1000, 5000, 10000], 'epochs': [25], 'hidden_neuron':[1024, 512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2], 'hidden_layers':[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'kernel_initializer': ['uniform', 'normal', 'glorot_uniform'], 'dropout': [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10], 'losses': [\"mape\", \"mse\"], 'shapes': ['brick', 'triangle', 'funnel'], 'activation': ['relu'], 'lr': [0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0005, 0.0009, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.009, 0.01, 0.02, 0.035, 0.05, 0.075, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9] } \r\n\r\n After finishing and analyzing the resulting csv file as an analyze object, I get the following result:  \r\ndir = \"TalosPipeline1/\" \r\nfile = \"101919222627.csv\" \r\nt = talos.Reporting(dir + file) \r\nt2 = talos.Analyze(t) \r\nt2.data.head()  \r\n\r\nAs you see in the image below, e.g. the optimizier column is showing floats and the first_neuron column is showing functions.  Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?  \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33901701/67190612-888aa900-f3f0-11e9-84f9-f4107f19deb3.png)\r\n\r\nadditional comment: Maybe the screenshot below helps...it seems that the dataframe has the exact same order, as the param print out while running. But alphabetically ordered column names.\r\n\r\nI tried to read through your code concerning the paramter setting, but I couldn't find the place, where this happens.\r\n\r\nMaybe somebody can?!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33901701/67190670-a6f0a480-f3f0-11e9-84d6-af4768596069.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks and br \r\n\r\n christoph","closed_by":{"login":"PurenBITeam","id":33901701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTAxNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33901701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam","html_url":"https://github.com/PurenBITeam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PurenBITeam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
