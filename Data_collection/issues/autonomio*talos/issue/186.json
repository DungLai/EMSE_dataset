When I request talos to scan 4 diferent SGD-based LR in a VGG architecture and using  \"clear_tf_session=False\", after the 3rd one some memory leaks (OOMs) are issued in the console. It looks like that SGD is more demanding for graphic cards memory (btw just to recall, I am using a couple of Quadro M4000 paired through SLI). Sometimes, scan fails due to OOM error. If I use \"clear_tf_session=True\", talos scan ends up to freeze unexpectedly, as it was reported before ( issue #159 ).\r\n\r\nAs you already figured out, I am in the middle of a dilemma. Would you help me out, please?\r\n\r\nIn advance, thank you for your attention!","closed_by":{"login":"TelmoAdao","id":26885476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg1NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26885476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao","html_url":"https://github.com/TelmoAdao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TelmoAdao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
