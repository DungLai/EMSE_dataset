In the 11th chapter, several main methods for hyperparamter tuning is discussed and it is concluded that random research is more efficient than grid research. Here is the point I want to present. Generally, in the section of random research in the book, it says that we generally define a interval for hyperparameters like [a,b] rather than some discrete values {a1, a2, b1, b2}, which can enlarge the search range without additional computational cost. So I want to ask if talos can achieve this.
