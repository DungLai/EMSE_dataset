When I try to use a grid to optimize SGD parameters (lr, decay and momentum - without grid downsample), Talos successfully starts to run several assays but after a few rounds, it just freezes indefinitely. I am using a workstation equipped with a dual Xeon Intel (54 logical cores, not quite sure the precise reference right now), 128 GB of RAM and two SLI paired Quadro M4000. Regarding the dataset, it is a short one, of around 300 pics divided by 6 classes, just for testing purposes. I coded according to your Notebook examples. A very simple version of VGG is being used as ML architecture.\r\n\r\nWould you please tell me what am I doing wrong? If you need more details, please, just let me know.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTelmo\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
