However, while it is defined in the parameter dictionary (`'hidden_layers':[0, 1, 2] `) , the `hidden_layers(model, params, 1)` call is never made during model creation.  I expect that the Concise example is defaulting to a single hidden layer in this example, and the code should be updated to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    from talos.model import hidden_layers    # Needed for fix below\r\n\r\n    def breast_cancer_model(x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val, params):\r\n\r\n        model = Sequential()\r\n        model.add(Dense(params['first_neuron'], input_dim=x_train.shape[1],\r\n                    activation=params['activation'],\r\n                    kernel_initializer=params['kernel_initializer']))\r\n    \r\n        model.add(Dropout(params['dropout']))\r\n\r\n        hidden_layers(model, params, 1) # Fix to add call to hidden_layers()\r\n\r\n        model.add(Dense(1, activation=params['last_activation'],\r\n                    kernel_initializer=params['kernel_initializer']))\r\n    \r\n        model.compile(loss=params['losses'],\r\n                  optimizer=params['optimizer'](),\r\n                  metrics=['acc', fmeasure_acc])\r\n    \r\n        history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, \r\n                        validation_data=[x_val, y_val],\r\n                        batch_size=params['batch_size'],\r\n                        callbacks=[live()],\r\n                        epochs=params['epochs'],\r\n                        verbose=0)\r\n\r\n        return history, model\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I am wrong :)","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
