Unfortunately, the option \"clear_tf_session = True\" doesn't help. I had already tried it without success. I also tried to put gc.collect() at the start of the function where you build the model. \r\n\r\nFinally, I played with some toy example (dataset with 6000 training examples), and I noticed that after the end of the iterations, the memory used by python gets very large in comparison with the memory usage at the start even if I remove all the variables in the workspace and do gc.collect().   \r\n\r\nI've attached my code for reference. It is a simple problem where I try to predict the verb tense in a sentence (7 possible tenses) from the surrounding words (limited to the 10000 most frequent words). \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n[FNN_tense1Verb_paramsearch.zip](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/files/3372356/FNN_tense1Verb_paramsearch.zip)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
