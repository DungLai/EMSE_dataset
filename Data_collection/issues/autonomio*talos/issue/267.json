It's really nice to be able to do hyperparameter optimization natively ! I really like the fact that we don't have to re write all our code to be compatible. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nEDIT \r\nif we replace history.history and params dict by an ordered dict sorted by keys it seems to fix the issue without having to change Python version.
