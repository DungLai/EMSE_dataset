However, tensorflow/Keras makes it _very easy_ to implement parallel GPU training when available. I already have the code to do this cleanly. Its just a matter of how (and if) to implement this.\r\n\r\nIn principle this can only be a good thing since tensorflow/Keras `multi_gpu_model` is essentially straightforward (I struggled with it for so long ðŸ™ƒ) if you know what you're doing with it. The only level of parallelism is at the batch level, so everything in Talos could work on top of it.\r\n\r\n@mikkokotila thoughts on this? Google.colab already accelerates any training I've seen done with Keras massively without any changes to code whatsoever, but to my knowledge you only get one GPU at a time. People with access to more could experience up to an 8-fold decrease in training time with a feature like this.","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
