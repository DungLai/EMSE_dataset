First of all, let me thank you for this nice tool that collected all of the optimization parameters in one experiment (run), specially neural network shape. I am writing to discuss with about the following questions that I faced through working on talos.\r\n\r\nHow could I define a range or discrete values for regularizes as an optimization parameter for hidden layers when I use hidden layers function?\r\nWhy did you enforce the hidden layer function to only use Dense layers not other types, and how could I use this function for other types of hidden layers like convolutional or LSTM layers?\r\nI am looking forward to hear from you very soon.\r\n\r\nWarm Regards,","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
