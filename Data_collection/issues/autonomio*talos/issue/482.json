off, make sure to check your [support options](https://github.com/autonomio/talos#-how-to-get-support).\r\n\r\nThe preferred way to resolve usage related matters is through the [docs](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/) which are maintained up-to-date with the latest version of Talos.\r\n\r\nIf you do end up asking for support in a new issue, make sure to follow the below steps carefully.\r\n\r\n#### 1) Confirm the below\r\n\r\n- [x] I have looked for an answer in the [Docs](https://autonomio.github.io/talos)\r\n- [x] My Python version is 3.5 or higher\r\n- [x] I have searched through the issues [Issues](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues) for a duplicate\r\n- [x] I've tested that my Keras model works as a stand-alone\r\n\r\n#### 2) Include the output of:\r\n\r\n`talos.__version__ == 0.6.7`\r\n\r\n#### 3) Explain clearly what you are trying to achieve\r\n\r\nI am running a grid search that gives 36 rounds.\r\nAfter about 4 or 5 rounds, during a model.fit I suddenly get hit by a `ResourceExhaustedError`. I think this is very odd given that I am able to complete at least 3 rounds of fitting on the GPU (with a model and batch size that takes up pretty much all the gpu memory), so it seems that there is a small but significant memory leak somewhere. Any ideas what it could be?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
