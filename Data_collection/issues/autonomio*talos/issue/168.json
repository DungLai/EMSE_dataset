I'm trying with all the combinations of keras and tensorflow GPU configs but no one it's working. My dataset is \"Train on 3204 samples, validate on 802 samples\", and the model summary is like this:\r\n```\r\nLayer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   \r\n=================================================================\r\nembedding_1 (Embedding)      (None, 50, 1000)          3419000   \r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nconv1d_1 (Conv1D)            (None, 50, 128)           640128    \r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\ndropout_1 (Dropout)          (None, 50, 128)           0         \r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nlstm_1 (LSTM)                (None, 50, 100)           91600     \r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nattention_tf_1 (Attention_tf (None, 100)               150       \r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\ndropout_2 (Dropout)          (None, 100)               0         \r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\ndense_1 (Dense)              (None, 18)                1818      \r\n=================================================================\r\n```\r\nmy params are: \r\n```\r\np = {'lr': (0.5, 5, 10),\r\n     'lstm_size':[500,200,100],\r\n     'conv1_size': [256,128,64],\r\n     'cn_shape':[5],\r\n     'batch_size': (50, 51, 100),\r\n     'epochs': [1],\r\n     'dropout': (0, 0.5, 1),\r\n     'embeding_size': [1000,10000],\r\n     'optimizer': [Adam],\r\n     'losses': [categorical_crossentropy, binary_crossentropy],\r\n     'activation':[relu, elu],\r\n     'last_activation': [softmax]}\r\n```\r\nI'm with a Geforce GTX 1080 ti, keras==2.2.4, tensorflow==1.8 and talos 0.4.6.
