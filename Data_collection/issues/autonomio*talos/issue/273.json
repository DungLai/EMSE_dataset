All results, as well as the headers are stored in a single list, which is the member object `self.result`, or temporary variable `_rr_out` respectively. However, to store the values, the dictionary keys are traversed and concatenated into the list. **And here comes the issue**: Python does not guarantee the order of keys in a dictionary! Therefore, it is possible that values like `acc` may become `acc_val`, or the `loss` value becomes a parameter, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt might be the case that this issue hardly happens for only a few metrics and parameters. But it definitely happens in my exhaustive evaluations with dozens of metrics and parameters.\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue can be very easily fixed by using a dictionary instead of a list for storing the results.
