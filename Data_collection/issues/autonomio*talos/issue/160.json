The training session runs inside a docker container on another server. To that end I build a docker container starting `FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-py3`. However, when I install talos in that container the tensorflow gpu version gets replaced by the cpu version, as that one is in talos' requirements. My workaround for now is deinstalling `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-gpu` and then reinstalling `tensorflow-gpu`, all after installing talos. However, that has the side effect that I need to upload a >1GB change when pushing the docker container initially.\r\nIs there a better way of handling the tensorflow dependency inside talos?","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
