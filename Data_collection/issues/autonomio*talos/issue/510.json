Thanks i was somehow able to make it work. But then i realized my laptop was giving me screen of death due to memory issue so i searched online and figured out i should try using fit_generator instead of fit. So  right now i am trying that but since i was busy lately so could not take up that project. Now when i am trying fit_generator and i am getting error. Since i m still new to python/machine learning i think it could be more of python issue than talos issue but any assistance would be of great help.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 4) Explain what you have already tried\r\nI was able to make keras standalone (without talos) to work with a single set of parameters. But problem happens when i try setting up parameter dictonary and then run the scan. Just for sake of it i tried changing multiple ways like a) Giving only set of parameter b) parameter giving as a list . Both the times i get different error. When using a) (i.e. only one set of value) i get error as \r\n**TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'list'**\r\nwhen using b) (i.e. list of values for parameters) i get error as\r\n**ValueError: The `kernel_size` argument must be a tuple of 1 integers. Received: [2, 4, 6]**\r\n\r\n*An outline of the steps that you have already taken so far*\r\n\r\n#### 5) Provide a code-complete reference\r\n\r\n- [ X] My support question includes an input model\r\n- [ X] My support question includes a parameter dictionary\r\n- [X ] My support question includes a `Scan()` command\r\n- [ ] My support question includes a link to a sample of the data\r\n(I havent provided this because for that i need to import data to google drive and i dont have enough space but if required i will make some way to do this\r\n\r\nNOTE: If the data is sensitive and can't be shared, [create dummy data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#samples-generator) that mimics it.\r\n\r\n**A self-contained Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or similar is highly preferred and will speed up helping you with your issue.**\r\n\r\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Twssq_MiQ4RxMZ69A595SFIgs4JhG18u?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
