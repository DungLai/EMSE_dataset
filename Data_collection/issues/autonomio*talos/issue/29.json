The CPU info it spits out is normal for my machine. Not used to a seg fault though. I've been looking through the test script to see where this might pop up. It seems to have to do with the number of scans I implement. For instance, implementing 8 scans on the first Iris model seg faults after four runs (meaning four calls to `_run`. However, changing the list `shapes` from\r\n\r\n`'shapes': ['stairs', 'triangle', 'hexagon', 'diamond', 'brick', 'long_funnel', 'rhombus', 'funnel']`\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n`'shapes': ['stairs', 'triangle', 'hexagon']`\r\n\r\ncauses no exit on the first Iris test (loops 3 time successfully) and then seg faults after the first run on the second Iris model.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is an issue with my machine or the test script since Talos works fine otherwise. Just thought I'd ask. @mikkokotila  feel free to close it if its a nonissue.
