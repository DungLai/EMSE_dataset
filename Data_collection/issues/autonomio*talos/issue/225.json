Integrating it in talos prevents the guessing game of how many iterations I have time to run (which must be conservative so I don't have to abort the run and loosing the results).\r\n\r\nlatest_start_time could be either in minutes or wall clock time or some way of selecting which one.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
