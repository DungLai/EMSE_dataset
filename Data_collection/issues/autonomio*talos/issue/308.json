I decided to try talos, so I used\r\n\r\n      pip install talos\r\n\r\nAnd wrote the import statement\r\n\r\n      import talos as ta\r\n\r\nThis is where it went wrong. I got the output listed below the checkboxes. I noticed that matplotlib had been downgraded to 2.2.3 after installing talos, so I force upgraded it to the latest stable again. The error message before and after were, I believe, slightly different, but both involved the backend in some way.
