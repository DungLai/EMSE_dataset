I'm deeply grateful for every question, suggestion, bug report, feature request, and PR. <3\r\n\r\n### Breaking new ground with v.0.5.0\r\n\r\nv.0.5.0 is now available in daily-dev and in the next few weeks it will make its way to production. The version brings together the work over the past several months, much of which have been included in previous updates but might not have been apparent, missed docstrings, was not polished etc. I'm happy to say that as it stands, there are no known issues that effect conducting experiments. Testing is importantly more robust than it was < v.0.4.7 and many high level abstractions have been added to support rapid development of robust testing and new features. \r\n\r\nThe really big upgrades that are only being rolled out in this version are two:\r\n\r\n1) The `ta` namespace from `import talos as ta` is now spanking clean and I think it's fair to say follows optimal use of python namespace\r\n\r\n2) First automl capabilities have been added in form of `KerasModel()` and `Params()`. `KerasModel()` allows network architecture testing as part of experiments and `Params()` helps generate or append params dictionaries. Now we can do:\r\n\r\n`ta.Scan(x=x, y=y, params=ta.Params().params, model=ta.KerasModel().model)`\r\n\r\n...which supports fully automated comprehensive architecture and hyperparameter search for any x and y. \r\n\r\nFor any questions or comments, feel free to open issues specific to your comments.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
