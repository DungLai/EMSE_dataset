Currently it looks the hidden_layers will get hard-coded key word for the feature inside parameters dictionary and this would have some restrictions in the use of hidden_layers. \r\nI would suggest to free the key words and enable the use of multi hidden layers refering to different parameter lists independently in one model. \r\n\r\n#### 2) Once implemented, I can see how this feature will\r\n\r\nWith this features, the researcher can use more flexible model optimization schemes and it can be more comfortable for broader scenarios. \r\n\r\n#### 3) I believe this feature is\r\n\r\n- [ ] critically important\r\n- [ ] must have\r\n- [x] nice to have\r\n\r\n#### 4) Given the chance, I'd be happy to make a PR for this feature\r\n\r\n- [ ] definitely\r\n- [ ] possibly\r\n- [x] unlikely\r\n\r\n---\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
