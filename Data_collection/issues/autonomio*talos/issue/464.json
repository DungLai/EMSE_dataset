The code seems to need a list, but when I give him a list, it does not work.\r\n\r\n#### 4) Explain what you have already tried\r\n\r\nIt tried something like this:\r\n\r\n1. `r.plot_corr('val_loss',exclude='lossfunction')` -->TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"list\") to str\r\n2. `r.plot_corr('val_loss',exclude=['lossfunction'])` --> ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity\r\n3. `r.plot_corr(metric='val_loss',exclude=[])` --> \"\r\n\r\nSo, the model and hyperparameter tuning works, it is just about the visualization. Hence, to focus on the problem, I have not included the model and whole code. If this is necessary, please let me know!\r\n\r\n#### 5) Provide a code-complete reference\r\n\r\n- [ ] My support question includes an input model\r\n- [ ] My support question includes a parameter dictionary\r\n- [ ] My support question includes a `Scan()` command\r\n- [ ] My support question includes a link to a sample of the data\r\n\r\nNOTE: If the data is sensitive and can't be shared, [create dummy data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#samples-generator) that mimics it.\r\n\r\n**A self-contained Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or similar is highly preferred and will speed up helping you with your issue.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
