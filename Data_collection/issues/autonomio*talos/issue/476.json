I would like to know why in my final output .csv file, the training data is near 100% accuracy, yet the testing accuracy is around 45% for a binary classification problem, using binary_crossentropy as the metric and doing a 60/40 train/test split. There seems to be quite a bit of overfitting going on. Wondering how I can combat that because I thought by default the `clear_tf_session ` was True by default. Wondering what might be going on here. I do have early_stopping callback set to moderate which I thought might help?\r\n\r\n2. When using the shapes arguments, is there a way to potentially add what the subsequent neuron widths were for each layer to the output.csv file? For example, if I have the following parameters:\r\n\r\n```\r\np = {'first_neuron':[32, 64, 128, 256],\r\n     'hidden_layers':[1, 2, 3],\r\n     'batch_size': [32, 64, 128, 256],\r\n     'epochs': [2000],\r\n     'dropout': [0, 0.25, 0.5],\r\n     'shapes':['brick', 'funnel', 'triangle'],\r\n     'optimizer': ['Nadam', 'Adam'],\r\n     'losses': ['binary_crossentropy'],\r\n     'activation':['relu', 'elu'],\r\n     'last_activation': ['sigmoid']}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...if it was currently scanning the 3 layer, triangle shape, could it possibly add 2 new columns to the .csv file showing how many 'first_neuron's were used in the subsequent layers? Also I'm just a little unclear on how the shapes work. Am I correct in assuming that brick means it'll use the same number of neurons for each layer, funnel will decrease the neuron width for the following layer(s), and triangle would do the opposite?\r\n\r\nLove the tool, first time running it tonight and if I can get these two things figured out, I'll be one happy camper! Thanks a lot!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"windowshopr","id":40477419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDc3NDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40477419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr","html_url":"https://github.com/windowshopr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windowshopr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
