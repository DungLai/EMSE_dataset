Background\r\n\r\nAs energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important topic, we want to increase the visibility and access to power draw during and after the experiment.\r\n\r\n## Guiding Principles\r\n\r\n- We don't want to create anything new here\r\n- We simply want to tie together two parts of the system that have already been built\r\n\r\n## How will it work\r\n\r\n- At the end of each permutation, calculate power draw data using the [PowerDrawCallback](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/blob/master/talos/utils/power_draw_callback.py)\r\n- Add `total_power_draw` as a new column to the experiment table in the DistributeScan central datastore\r\n\r\n## Historically related Issues\r\n\r\n- autonomio/jako#10 \r\n- autonomio/talos#415
