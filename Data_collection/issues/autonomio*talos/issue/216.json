I couldn't find any other contact info, that is why I am posting here.\r\n\r\nI have started TALOS (Tensor Abstraction Layer ObjectS) in 2017  https://github.com/pankap/talos but since then my repository was not so active. I have presented a tutorial on TALOS at AUTH university and also mentioned my framework in a paper published at the ICIP2018 conference.\r\n\r\nI am looking for the best solution so that both our works would not be confused. I have created a Keras like framework and as I understand yours is an add-on for hyperparameter search. I would kindly ask if some distinction can be made in your naming, so it would not be confusing with my acronym.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance and if you prefer we can continue the discussion in private.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
