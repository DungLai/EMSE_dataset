most talos code examples, X input seems to be a 2D numpy array.\r\nBut in some of my keras models, it requires a list of 2D numpy arrays because my models are not `Sequential`.\r\nExample list: `[numpyarray1, numpyarray2, numpyarray3]`.\r\n\r\nIt seems that when I try to pass this list to the `ta.Scan` function, things break.\r\n\r\nHow do I pass in a list of inputs?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure if `talos` supports `pandas` DataFrame or not.
