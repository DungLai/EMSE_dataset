This is perhaps not the nicest way of expressing this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a simple approach would be, if there's no decent (defined or otherwise) string conversion to reference them as the parameter entry key, and the index.\r\n\r\nSo `\"my_param_key\": [Lambda x: x**2, Lambda x: x**3]` would then report \"my_param_key_0\" and \"my_param_key_1\" in the reporting tables.\r\n\r\nI haven't delved too deep into the Talos codebase to see the feasibility of this. Was just wanting to report this behaviour, as it's somewhat annoying to the user as they are unsure which lambda was selected.\r\n\r\nPS - I'm aware that a richer object could be used to wrap this, which has its own `__repr__` method defined. But as far as baked in implementations go, this could be a small tweak to bring more user friendly output.","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
