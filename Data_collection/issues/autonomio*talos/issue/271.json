stringifies all results which makes the appending of the history with own statistics and evaluations during scan futile.\r\nIn my case, I append numpy arrays and even keras models for further evaluation to the history object.\r\nHowever, here is an example commit which disables stringification and works with my evaluations: https://github.com/tik0/talos/tree/disable_stringification\r\n\r\nI find this feature actually very useful because it is the only way to get user defined objects out of the scan loop.\r\nIf this feature is desired, I will elaborate more on
