So we have to run the 'fit' function with relatively small number of epochs (in my case approx. 4 - 32 epochs) multiple times to allow the model to learn from the continuously changing x and y data.\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding of how talos is used, it means that in order to  optimize my hyperparameters, I have to make multiple calls to the Scan() function (in my case it would be about 15000 times), which I don't think is the most effective way of doing it. Am I missing something here?\r\n\r\nP.S. To illustrate what I am talking about, here is a project that is similar to what I am working on\r\nhttps://github.com/OctThe16th/PPO-Keras/blob/master/Main.py\r\n\r\nSpecifically, take a look at line 221 onwards. In line 222, the x and y data are updated in every iteration, which are then used to train the 2 networks (actor and critic) at lines 229 and 230 for several epochs for that iteration.","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
