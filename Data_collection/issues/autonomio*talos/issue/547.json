Before you do, please go through the below checklist carefully and make sure to prepare your bug report in a way that facilitates effective handling of the matter.\r\n\r\n#### 1) Confirm the below\r\n\r\n- [ X] My Python version is 3.5 or higher\r\n- [ X] I have searched through the issues [Issues](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues) for a duplicate\r\n- [ X] I've tested that my Keras model works as a stand-alone\r\n\r\n#### 2) Include the output of:\r\n\r\n`talos.__version__`\r\n1.0.0\r\n\r\n#### 3) Explain clearly what you expect to happen\r\nRun a test using my hand-built param dictionary.  One of the keys is 'loss'.
