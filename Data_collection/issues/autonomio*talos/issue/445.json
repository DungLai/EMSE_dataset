These options are equivalent to the options in `` `keras```.\r\n\r\n#### 2) Why?\r\n\r\nIn models development it's necessary to have a higher control over the train/validation set to ensure the reproducibility of the experiment.\r\n\r\n**For example**: let's say I created a model A with certain hyper parameters and considering defined train/validation set (keras CIFAR-10 is a good example). However, I would like to evaluate other hyper parameters for my architecture using *talos*. To do this, it's necessary to fix, as model A, the original train/validation set for my experiment to give the opportunity to compare and to ensure the reproducibility of the code on other machines.\r\n\r\n#### 3) I believe this feature is\r\n\r\n- [ ] critically important\r\n- [X] must have\r\n- [ ] nice to have\r\n\r\n#### 4) Given the chance, I'd be happy to make a PR for this feature\r\n- [ ] definitely\r\n- [X] possibly\r\n- [ ] unlikely\r\n\r\nBut to a PR, I need to understand how/where *talos* does train validation split, if you show me I would glad help this package improvement (it is awesome).","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
