I finally managed to install tensorflow-gpu=2.3 via conda and Talos 1.0 via pip without any issues or error reports back then and the training on this system worked without any issues. \r\n\r\nOn the new system, however, exporting the old environment either with an explicit-package-file or by exporting the packages into a yml didn't work as one of the packages was always missing. So I skipped this and moved on to create the env from scratch and tried basically all possible permutations to install tensorflow-gpu and talos but always end up with a dying kernel as soon as I import talos and tensorflow or the optimization process outputs nan as loss for some (but not all) hyperparameter combinations, which is not very surprising as the install process keeps uninstalling and installing previously installed packages and finally ends with an error about tensorflow-gpu=2.2 (which was never actually installed) \r\n\r\nEdit: having tensorflow-gpu=2.3 with talos and no errors or version changes during the setup and using the same code without any changes on the old system returns reliable optimization results for each combination\r\n\r\nThat are the final logs of the talos install process. Previously I have installed tensorflow-gpu=2.1 and updated it to tensorflow-gpu=2.3\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8342994/106557916-3311d700-6523-11eb-9b9d-7d7ba06c8544.png)\r\n\r\nI also tried different talos builds (stated in the docs) but they appear to have ceased to exist. Could you please provide information on how to install pip along with the latest conda tensorflow-gpu (2.3)?","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
