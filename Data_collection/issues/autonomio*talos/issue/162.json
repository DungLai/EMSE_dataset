This is because I believe it will be a better way to select the best models when using Predict(). Right now I just open and write the .csv file in my scripts after the scan ... not always feasible ...\r\n\r\nYou mentioned new available tools in your answer, is there any doc about them and what version to use ? \r\n\r\nAlso, I have access to a computing network (handled with slurm) and I wanted to split the trainings between different nodes (CPU, of course slower than a GPU but since there is only one of the latter and hundreds or the former ... parallel wins over serial). SO basically I just split the experiment dict into smaller ones and distribute them over the different nodes. And in the end I concatenate the csv for analysis. \r\n\r\nBut this poses a problem when appending the csv file due to the file stageout. Is something related to that being investigated or in the making ?","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
