This seems like something is going wrong, as if anything it should be producing the corresponding fbeta_score for that epoch I would have though.  \r\n\r\nI am not interested  in accuracy due to class imbalance in my system, and the accuracy saturates after a few epochs, so I need to talos to store for each parameter combination either:\r\n\r\na) The result of the last epoch \r\nb) Ideally the result with the best fbeta_score \r\n\r\nGiven that fbeta_score has been implemented, I assume this must be possible but I don't see how. \r\n\r\nI am using the latest dev branch  v0.2 (as I have augmented data, I needed the functionality to supply x_val and y_val as parameters).
