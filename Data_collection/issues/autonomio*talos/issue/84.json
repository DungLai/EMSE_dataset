The goal of the quasirandom approaches (e.g. Latin Hypercube, Sobol, Halton...) is to minimize clumping. \r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting variations here seems to be *Latin hypercube with a sudoku-like constraint*. [[link]](https://github.com/Technologicat/sudoku_lhs/blob/master/sudoku_lhs/sudoku.py)\r\n\r\nBasically what we seem to need here is a way to perform a quasirandom shuffle (instead of the pseudorandom one we use now). That library is not available it seems, so it might have to be built. My goal would be to make available for the user several quasirandom shuffle options.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
