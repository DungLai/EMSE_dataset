Here are the steps I have taken:\r\n\r\nI am inside a virtual environment\r\nI run pip install gamify\r\nI find the location that the package is installed in -> /Users/chriscollins/cchurndev2/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gamify\r\nI add this to the path using export PATH = $PATH:[above_link]\r\n\r\nBut when I try to run 'python gamify directory_of_experiment' I get an error saying gamify couldnt be found. I have tried also adding .py onto the end of the path, like in your example, but this does not work either (I took the .py off because the directory just points to a folder with __main__ and __init__ inside, not a .py file (although I havent built any packages yet so I may be doing something wrong there)/\r\n\r\nI can confirm that running 'python /Users/chriscollins/cchurndev2/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gamify' starts up the server, but it throws the following error: \r\njinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: overview.html\r\n\r\nIf I look into the directory I can see that no templates/static folder exists. If I clone the repo and drag those folders into the directory, then the dashboard loads up but I only see 'todo' on the metric dropdowns instead of the parameters I want to plot.\r\n\r\nI hope this is an easy fix for someone, I think I've tied myself up in knots and made this a lot more difficult than it is!","closed_by":{"login":"qemtek","id":18211372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjExMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18211372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek","html_url":"https://github.com/qemtek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qemtek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
