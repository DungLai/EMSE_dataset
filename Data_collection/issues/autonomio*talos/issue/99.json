A production model could be something that does a one-off job for a research paper, or something that goes into a live environment with real-time data inputs. Or anything else really. Roughly speaking: \r\n\r\n(P)repare >> the user decides the hyperparameter space (params dict), constructs the Keras model and wires it, and configures the experiment (Scan). \r\n\r\n(O)ptimize >> talos handles everything from splitting the data to train, test, and kfold validation, running through the hyperparameter space based on the set configuration, stops once n models meet the experiment goal, picks the best models, evaluates for generality and picks the best or several best ones (later here we can have an ensemble as opposed to discrete models)\r\n\r\n(D)eploy >> talos creates a zip/gzip with a deploy script and all the assets. The deploy script is able to setup in a fresh install / container / vagrant box, and the package includes all the needed assets so in any system you can just start using the model. Later this could include an option for REST api that is deployed to the extent where now you have a REST api where you can send in data and get back predictions.  \r\n\r\nHere we have to modes; regular and pipeline. Regular would work the way things work now, i.e. it is up to the user to look at the results, and make further decisions based on that. In a pipeline mode, the process ends when the permutations are depleted, or when a set objective is met (e.g. find a model that has at least 85% f1-score). Best model/s is evaluated, and deploy package is stored locally. In the regular mode, scan ends when the permutations are depleted, after which a set of analysis and evaluation tools can be used to decide on the next steps. \r\n\r\nSo this requires at least two new parameters to Scan()\r\n\r\n- target_metric\r\n- target_value\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/99/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
