Let me explain.\r\n\r\nI installed Talos using\r\n```\r\npip3 install talos\r\n```\r\nin a virtual environment. Within that environment I just start a python3 interpreter and type\r\n```\r\nimport talos as ta\r\n```\r\nwhich works perfectly fine. As soon as I try something like\r\n```\r\nta.Scan()\r\n```\r\nI get\r\n```\r\n>>> ta.Scan()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nAttributeError: module 'talos' has no attribute 'Scan'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTyping `ta.` and using tab for autocompleting shows only my own methods but none of the ones that should be available by talos.\r\n\r\nI tried Google and I looked through the closed issues but I didn't find anything.\r\n\r\nBest regards","closed_by":{"login":"j-holub","id":19982919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTgyOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19982919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub","html_url":"https://github.com/j-holub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-holub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
