Or any other such arbitrary python code. \r\n\r\nI'd like to write a custom metric which involves some quite complicated operations and simply appending the result of arbitrary python code at the end (or during) a talos parameter-iteration would be very handy.  \r\n\r\nI started trying to write a Keras metric to do what I want, but its a real pain as I need to operate on tensors with  (?, ?, ?) shape (undefined on compile time) and thus can't do things like calculate the length of the array, or use for loops. i.e. the code has to be properly vectorized.\r\n\r\nEdit: In fact, if there is a way to simply save the keras model from the each talos parameter-iteration, then that would also let me run arbitrary code.
