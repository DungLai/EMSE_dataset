I really appreciate your help. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHere is the thing. The results of hyperparameter tuning was pretty good. The val_loss and loss was satisfactory. After doing hyperparamter tuning I tried to use ta.Depoly() and ta.Restore() to predict output in a test data set. However, I found that runing the below codes would return totally uncorrect results which are totally different from actual values. As the below codes show, I also tried traning data set and validation data set but I still got uncorrect results which would cause val_loss and loss very large. I am wondering am I using wrong codes? Do you have an idea? \r\n\r\nHere are the codes.
