Working with lots of models which I run `predict()` on for validation. I am having an issue trying to find a way to predict without having to create a file. I've got a large core box running 24/7 creating lots of models. I would rather not create so many directories and zips for the models.   I forked and made a quick change to the `deploy()` command by pulling all the saving into another function and adding a flag to pass to init, also having it return an activate model when given the model specs just like restore does. \r\n\r\nI am wondering if I missed something in the documentation or in the code that will allow me to use the prediction on a keras model object without send the scan obejct to a file via csv or with deploy. \r\n\r\n - if there **is** a way point it out to me and I will update the documentation and put in a pull request\r\n - if there **isn't** a way and this is something that is applicable to contribute I will happily make my _first_ contribution\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"rahutchinson","id":9100245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDAyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9100245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson","html_url":"https://github.com/rahutchinson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahutchinson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/126/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
