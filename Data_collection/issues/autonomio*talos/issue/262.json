From your article, _hyperparameter optimization with keras 2018_, you stated that the hidden layers, learning rate and dropout do have a negative correlation with val_acc  (please see below the image):\r\n\r\n**![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47783454/53890374-66424780-4028-11e9-962a-40be94559680.png)**\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean for a negative correlation against the performance metric to occur under this condition? \r\n\r\n2. Secondly, the kernel density estimation, also from the same article as seen below:\r\n\r\n**![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47783454/53894598-a73e5a00-4030-11e9-86a0-8bc315376b20.png)**\r\n\r\nI understand that the x-axis represent parameter boundaries from the dropout dictionary. My question is are there existing values inbetween these generated boundaries in the graph with respect to the contour lines? Let me rephrase, since the countour lines are generated in that form, is it linked with values in the x-axis that are not visible?   \r\n\r\n3. Lastly, out of curiosity, what type of algortihm those Talos operate on? \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply :) Thank you!\r\n\r\nUr Talos fan\r\n\r\nAlex :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"franzalex1980","id":47783454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzgzNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47783454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980","html_url":"https://github.com/franzalex1980","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franzalex1980/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
