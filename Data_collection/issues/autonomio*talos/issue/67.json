The problem is the dataset is quite big, normally in training I use` fit_generator `to load the data in batch from disk, but the Talos only support `fit `method.\r\n\r\nI tried to load the whole data to memory, by using this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrain_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(\r\n    original_dir,\r\n    target_size=(img_height, img_width),\r\n    batch_size=train_nb,\r\n    class_mode='categorical')\r\nX_train,y_train = train_generator.next()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the when performing `talos.Scan()`, the OS kills it because of large memory usage. I also tried to undersampling my dataset to only 10%, but it's still too big.\r\n\r\nI saw that the issue #11 is being working on, but I wonder is there any workaround strategy to perform Hyperparameter Opimization for large dataset in this case?","closed_by":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
