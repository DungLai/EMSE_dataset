For better error estimation, Talos also supports **N-fold cross-evaluation**  via _scan_object.evaluate_models(x_val, y_val, n=N)_ method.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be great if we could also could automatically **train** our models on N different folds of the training data and then average resulting metrics for proper **cross-validation**.
