off, make sure to check your [support options](https://github.com/autonomio/talos#-how-to-get-support).\r\n\r\nThe preferred way to resolve usage related matters is through the [docs](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/) which are maintained up-to-date with the latest version of Talos.\r\n\r\nIf you do end up asking for support in a new issue, make sure to follow the below steps carefully.\r\n\r\n#### 1) Confirm the below\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have looked for an answer in the [Docs](https://autonomio.github.io/talos)\r\n**Yes**\r\n- [x] My Python version is 3.5 or higher\r\n**3.8.3**\r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched through the issues [Issues](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues) for a duplicate\r\n**Yes i found one issue #419 which might be similar but i am unable to figure out what was the exact issue**\r\n\r\n- [x] I've tested that my Keras model works as a stand-alone\r\n**Yes, my code works as stand alone that much part i hope i have tested positively**\r\n#### 2) Include the output of:\r\n\r\n`talos.__version__`\r\n**0.6.4**\r\n\r\n#### 3) Explain clearly what you are trying to achieve\r\n\r\n*A description of your specific use-case and what you hope to achieve with it*\r\n**I am trying to build a siamese network which inputs two inputs. However when performing talos scan i am getting error as missing 2 required positional arguments: 'y_val' and 'params'. To me this seems more of a python problem rather than talos problem but i am not so sure how to fix or troubleshoot it. I am new with python and machine learning**\r\n\r\n#### 4) Explain what you have already tried\r\n**My keras model without talos is working**\r\n*An outline of the steps that you have already taken so far*\r\n\r\n#### 5) Provide a code-complete reference\r\n**However when i try to use talos i am unable to make it work.
