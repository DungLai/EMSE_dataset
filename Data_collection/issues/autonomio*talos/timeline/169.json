However, I have a couple of questions, would be really helpful if you could anwser them.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n ```python\r\ne = ta.Evaluate(h)\r\ne.evaluate(\r\n    x_val,\r\n    y_val,\r\n    folds=10,\r\n    metric='mean_squared_error',\r\n    mode='regression',\r\n    print_out=True)\r\n```\r\nreturns\r\n```python\r\nmean : 0.46 \r\n std : 0.01\r\n[0.4518117945302803,\r\n 0.4725303323616019,\r\n 0.4496370901497834,\r\n 0.4615459235263695,\r\n 0.4770823200189714,\r\n 0.4690325974030223,\r\n 0.4575328185155446,\r\n 0.4670078357595127,\r\n 0.46224965342613067,\r\n 0.4520023687112262]\r\n```\r\nWhat does the output mean exactly? I guess these may be results of the 10-fold cross-validation on my **x_val** and **y_val** data, but which of the models is being tested, the best one?\r\n\r\nAlso, the docstring seems to be slightly wrong: it mentions **sort_metric : string** parameter, but the function expects **metric : string** instead.\r\n\r\n2. My initial goal is to find the best hyperparameters, so I tried doing it using **Reporting** class:\r\n```python\r\nr = ta.Reporting(h)\r\nr.best_params(metric='mean_squared_error', n=1, ascending=True)\r\n```\r\nreturns\r\n```python\r\narray([['1', '0.2', '9', '128', 'relu', '1', '0.1',\r\n        \"<class 'keras.optimizers.Adam'>\", 'relu', 0]], dtype=object)\r\n``` \r\nSo it seems to be working! \r\nI still have a couple of questions, though:\r\n\r\n   1) **best_params** docstring says that it \"Adds an index as the last column\". What index should it be? Right now it seems as it's just an index of order in which the method prints the results. I guess it could be useful if it indicated the index of the best model...\r\n\r\n   2) Also, is there a way to understand which values refer to which hyperparameters in the array that **best_params** outputs? If I have several hyperparameters with the same possible values, it might be difficult to decipher where they belong without the keys.\r\n\r\nOverall, I might be going in the wrong direction, so again: I would like to find the hyperparameters of the best model. Could you please advise the right approach to get them for sure, with little confusion?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help,\r\nEgor\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/455075918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erevkov","id":12238482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM4NDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12238482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov","html_url":"https://github.com/erevkov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erevkov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/455082779","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/169#issuecomment-455082779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/169","id":455082779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTA4Mjc3OQ==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T08:22:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T08:22:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great that you can now use Evaluate.evaluate(). \r\n\r\nRegarding your questions, there is the issue #149 which will resolve this.

revisiting the issue since I've stumbled onto something that I think is related to your prior fix:\r\n\r\nBasically, my analysis is the same as before, although I split my data into training and validation sets manually for this step.\r\n\r\nI want to perform cross-evaluation for my regression models.\r\nWhen I run\r\n```python\r\nh.evaluate_models(x_val, y_val, metric='val_mean_squared_error', folds=10, asc=True)\r\n```\r\nI get the following error:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call
