spent some time testing this yesterday, and cleaned it up a little https://github.com/autonomio/talos/commit/9787ff150e185ff5a51a25c69978d2c50621ce79 as well as moving it to its own function under parameters, but I think it belongs to reducers so it might end up there. Because it basically serves the purpose of reducing the sample. This leads to an important point. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that right now what happens is that this over-rides grid downsampling. This means that if both `permutation_filter` and `grid_downsample`are applied, `permutation_filter` makes whatever `grid_dowsample` have done null. \r\n\r\n### Useful background information\r\n\r\nBasically the Talos use design is as follows: \r\n\r\n**level-1)** setup the experiment >> creates the experiment\r\n**level-2)** decide a random method to decrease grid size >> creates the permutation grid and index\r\n**level-3)** apply reducers  to further decrease the grid size  >> edits the index\r\n\r\nThe way a reducer works is that it goes to the current results, and identifies what is contributing performance / lack of performance and outputs a parameter value, parameter values, or combinations of parameter values. So far a lot of the work have been in preparation to allow building of a comprehensive library of known and unknown optimization/selection strategies which plug in at level-3.\r\n\r\nAs I can see, permutation_filter is on one hand a means to explicitly state reduction criteria and apply it right at the beginning of the experiment, and on the other it provides a meaningful interface to accept outputs from all reducers, find the index numbers from the current grid, and block those index numbers from the current index. \r\n\r\nOnce we figure out how to fit permutation_filter to this bigger picture, the \"over-riding\" issue mentioned above is also automatically resolved. The key point is to retain the design flow: \r\n\r\n- create experiment (Scan)\r\n- create grid and index (grid_downsample)\r\n- edit the index to block values (everything else)\r\n\r\n@JohanMollevik

if it voids the result of the downsample then that is sa bug, the design I aimed at was to return exactly as many results that the downsample would have returned.\r\n\r\nRight, I was viewing it as a downsampling step where I change the shape of the premutation hypercube to only consider some parts of it. The reason I did it like that is to respect round_limit and not run fewer iterations than specified, suppose that I feel I need 200 ierations to get reliable statistics I would like it to run exactly 200 times and not less. If I on the other hand did a grid downsample then the current reducer design makes sense.\r\n\r\nAre my way of looking at it like a downsampling step workable or do you want it to change to be more of a reducer?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/469237232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JohanMollevik","id":43040671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQwNjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43040671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik","html_url":"https://github.com/JohanMollevik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/469251290","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/223#issuecomment-469251290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/223","id":469251290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI1MTI5MA==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T13:23:38Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T13:23:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JohanMollevik  Thanks for clarifying, that helps me to think about the taxonomy/levels more clearly.

various procedures that are used for limiting the extent of the _experiment_ by some input, and _reducers_ as various procedurers\r\n\r\n**LIMITERS:**\r\n\r\n  - limit by sample (e.g. no more than 1% of all)\r\n  - limit by round (e.g. no more than 100 permutations)\r\n  - limit by time (e.g. start the last permutation at 8 am)\r\n  - limit by metric (e.g. stop when 'f1_score > 0.9)\r\n\r\nAm I missing something here?\r\n\r\n**REDUCERS:**\r\n\r\nA reducer would be anything that can be applied within a preset window into the experiment, where the intention is to identify poorly performing parameters, which then are used to reduce the remaining permutation grid. \r\n\r\nThe three levels - _experiment_ (level-1), _limits_ (level-2), and _reducers_ (level-3) - require a basis on which they can communicate i.e. the parameter grid. The experiment sets the boundary, limit is used to limit the experiment to a subset of the original boundary, and reducer is used to keep further limiting the boundary in an arbitrary manner throughout the experiment. \r\n\r\nThoughts/questions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/517935966","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/223#issuecomment-517935966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/223","id":517935966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzkzNTk2Ng==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-03T16:11:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-03T16:11:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This appears to be handled so closing here.
