There is also the case of how to really handle this beyond just the code implementation. \r\n\r\nFor example you might end up with 10-20 configurations with close to identical result. So it seems there is a need rather to add another layer of automation, where a configurable number of best results is picked, and then run again in a meaningful process that picks the best one. This leads to the question of \"best\" in terms of a well generalizing model vs. test performance. \r\n\r\nThe way I found the process tends to play out is something like...start with something pretty broad, and end up with some ideas on how to improve. Then narrow the boundaries, and end up with some ideas on how to improve even more. Maybe repeat this a few times, depending on the prediction task, and end up with a bunch of well performing configurations. So this will be another useful layer of process automation but involves more open questions than the one mentioned above. So I'm a little inclined to skip the \"legacy\" approach of picking the best model all together at least for now and go straight to figuring out an approach that appreciates the problem more.\r\n\r\nIn which case the parameter save_best_model is redundant for now.

Thanks for the response! I have some ways in mind that could be used address these concerns as well. They pertain closely to my current research. What it appears you're talking about is a more insightful way of picking the best hyperparameters (HP). I have two ideas about this depending on how far you're willing to take this.\r\n\r\nFirst, the first step could be exactly what Talos already does: screen different HP configurations, but then pick the top N of them. Second, of those top N models, randomly permute the test/train/dev sets and retrain/eval for each permutation. Implement some measure of model robustness such that only models that are robust to the random permutations of the data are kept and return the best overall. This also might involve a more thoughtful split of the data initially so as to avoid bias.\r\n\r\nSecond, you (we?) should consider evolutionary algorithms. This will greatly improve performance overall and could be built on top of the first step.\r\n\r\nBut anyway regarding the actual issue here I understand what you're saying. Is there any way to completely remove the option and prior package (Hyperio) to avoid confusion?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/406765422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1745924114,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc0NTkyNDExNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1745924114","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-21T02:45:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1745924115,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NDU5MjQxMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1745924115","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-21T02:45:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/406818547","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/17#issuecomment-406818547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/17","id":406818547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjgxODU0Nw==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-21T19:29:11Z","updated_at":"2018

👍 \r\n\r\nRegarding your first idea, I agree. Maybe there is an option to pick top N configurations / all configurations that meet a set metric threshold. It will probably be a good idea to always throw in some randomly or otherwise picked configurations for control purpose. \r\n\r\nRegarding the split of the data, I think the starting point would be that a \"large as possible\" portion of the original dataset is reserved for the Val() stage and it never touch the Scan() stage. Then split further in some meaningful way when it gets to Val(). It seems that the splitting part will be trivial and not affecting the mainline of Val() so might be better to handle it separately later. The other thing is to have all configurations in Val() run n times and measure std, mean and max as evaluation metric as opposed to just the objective metric (e.g. f1 score). \r\n\r\nRegarding evolutionary algorithms. I think that is a great idea. After having lightly reviewed the many approaches used for this problem, I thought the evolutionary algorithm approach was very interesting. Are you familiar with the python libraries for that purpose? Do you have suggestions for how to best approach adding it. I think it would be a good idea to prioritize this as it makes the current iterative approach redundant and allows shifting focus to the next layer of process automation. I'll create a separate issue on that with some related questions. \r\n\r\n[EDIT] There is now #18 for the evolutionary algorithm
