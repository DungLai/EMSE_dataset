Talos will compute everything that is in the input model, regardless if it relates with tf/keras or not. This gives you unrestricted power to add any logic to the input model.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate that there is a benefit in following a pattern by a library that benefits many in the Talos community. Thank you for suggesting it üëç ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/752699758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4157947671,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQxNTc5NDc2NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/4157947671","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-30T17:32:26Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"d3d3d3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/752727017","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/528#issuecomment-752727017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/528","id":752727017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjcyNzAxNw==","user":{"login":"Smolky","id":1757190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1757190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky","html_url":"https://github.com/Smolky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-30T19:08:19Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T19:08:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi. Thanks for your answer. First, I have to thank you for this tool. It is very useful to me.\r\n\r\nBefore I post my suggestion, I considered the following approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Skip it inside the model, but I tried to return ```None, None``` but I think Talos expect both ```History``` and ```Model``` as output after each iteration. Moreover, I think that if you want to limit the permutations, this approach is not useful because if you set ```round_limit```, Talos will not try as many combinations as it could.\r\n2. Specify, beforehand, the valid combinations. In this case, I remember that scikit allows list of dictionaries as inputs, but I have no idea how complex it this to implement with Talos.\r\n\r\nKind regards and happy new year\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/752727017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Smolky","id":1757190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1757190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky","html_url":"https://github.com/Smolky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smolky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
