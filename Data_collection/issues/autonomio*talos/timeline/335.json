One of the grid param keys is missing from the header, which means that even if I would remove the concatenation step, it would still have resulted in an error. How is the header column generated? I would have assumed that it reads the `param.keys()`, but then the missing header (`\"class_weights\"`) should not be possible. I Hope you have enough information to find a solution.

can see that the parameter dictionary you are posting above does not match the model or the expected output you mention. Is it that you add parameters after starting the experiment? The headers columns are based on reading the parameter dictionary at the beginning of the experiment. So that would cause a problem.
