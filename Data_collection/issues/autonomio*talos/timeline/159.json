use \"clear_tf_session=False\".\r\n\r\nWell, now a similar matter brought me here to ask for your advise once again. When I request talos to scan 4 diferent SGD-based LR in a VGG architecture and using  \"clear_tf_session=False\", after the 3rd one some memory leaks (OOMs) are issued in the console. It looks like that SGD is more demanding for graphic cards memory (btw just to recall, I am using a couple of Quadro M4000 paired through SLI). Sometimes, scan fails due to OOM error. If I use \"clear_tf_session=True\", talos scan ends up to freeze unexpectedly, as it was reported before ( issue #159 ).\r\n\r\nAs you already figured out, I am in the middle of a dilemma.
