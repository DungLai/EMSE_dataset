I am not very sure how I can use generator to change the training data.\r\n\r\nTypically, this is how trainings are done:\r\n1. Generate training data: This is done by generating (and storing) random inputs to be passed into current networks. Then use the predict() function to obtain and store the networks' outputs. The input-output pairs obtained in this step will be used for the upcoming training.\r\n2. Train the networks: Done by running the fit() function with small number of epochs.\r\n3. Generate next batch of training data: Which is basically step 1, but the data is now generated by the newly trained networks. The data used for previous training are to be completely discarded and never used anymore.\r\n\r\nBased on these steps, do you think it's possible to use generator to remove the need for calling the fit() function multiple times?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/467532405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hanstjua","id":40170511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTcwNTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40170511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua","html_url":"https://github.com/hanstjua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanstjua/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/467873824","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/237#issuecomment-467873824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/237","id":467873824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Nzg3MzgyNA==","user":{"login":"JohanMollevik","id":43040671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQwNjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43040671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik","html_url":"https://github.com/JohanMollevik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-27T14:05:57Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T14:05:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What you can do is the following\r\nIf you create a generator by extending keras Sequence you have the following signature to play with\r\n\r\n    class Generator(keras.utils.Sequence):\r\n        def __getitem__(self,index): # returns one batch of training data (specified by index) or None at end of epoch\r\n        def __len__(self): # returns number of training batches availible\r\n        def on_epoch_end(self): # called at the end of each epoch\r\n\r\nTo use this you can set this up so that the current training data is stored in som class local variable at the end of each epoch you get a call to `on_epoch_end` where you can replace the training data with new data.
