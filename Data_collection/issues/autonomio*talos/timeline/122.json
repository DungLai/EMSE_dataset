Basically I have histograms of six bins for different configurations (invariant masses basically). I want to interpolate this histogram in order to have the distributions (aka these 6 bins) for configurations that I do not know. To do so I use the configuration parameters as inputs and 6 outputs representing each bin, that I can either define separately with their own parameters or altogether. The only issue was in the evaluate function that uses the f1_score that breaks down because it is not a classification.\r\n\r\nMy workaround was to modifiy this script to replace the f1_score by a score suited for regression with multiple outputs (mean_squared_error for example).\r\n\r\nSo far it has been working, if you have no problem with that I can close the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
