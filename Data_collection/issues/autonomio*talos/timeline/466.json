That's one of the guiding principles of Talos' development. \r\n\r\nHave a look at the many [optimization strategies](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/Optimization_Strategies?id=optimization-strategies) available in Talos. They all work towards the goal of reducing the wall clock time taken to complete an experiment. \r\n\r\nThe simplest thing you can do to get started is to use one of the [reduction limits](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/Scan) available in `Scan()`. \r\n\r\nLimit | Input | Description\r\n--------- | ------- | -----------\r\n`performance_target` | list | A result at which point to end experiment\r\n`fraction_limit` | float | The fraction of permutations to be processed\r\n`round_limit` | int | Maximum number of permutations in the experiment\r\n`time_limit` | datetime | Time limit for experiment in format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`\r\n`boolean_limit` | function | Limit permutations based on a lambda function\r\n\r\nYou could for example just start with `talos.Scan(...round_limit=100...)` which will limit the number of permutations to 100, which are randomly picked from the total parameter space. \r\n\r\nYou can share your parameter dictionary, and I might be able to point out some best practices there as well.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/585927249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3036189177,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzAzNjE4OTE3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/3036189177","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-13T19:19:15Z","rename":{"from":"Execution
