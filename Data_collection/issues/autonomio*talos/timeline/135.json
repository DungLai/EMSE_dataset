the error you are getting, did I gather it correctly and you are able to run the experiment when all the values are ints?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't change all floats to ints, as some parameters are floats (like dropout and lr). There could of course be some simple system that converts values to ints if all values are whole numbers in float form. That way there is no possible downside it seems. \r\n\r\nThat said, the error you are getting might have to do with something other than what it seems to have to do. As I see, the error itself comes from trying to use a float for range (or so it seems). I have witnessed rare cases where something similar happened with a similar effect, where actually the error messages gave zero indication of the actual issue (?!). These were caused by:\r\n\r\n### 1) model is not in standard format\r\n\r\nFirst regarding the input model, to be safe, the format always has to be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef model_ta(x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val, params):\r\n\r\n    # the model contents is here\r\n    \r\n    return out, model\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe key point here is that the model arguments has to be exactly like that, and the return has to be exactly like that as well (where model that is created inside the function, and out is the history object),. \r\n\r\n2) some of the parameters that are expected to follow standard naming convention (eg. 'first_neuron' and 'dropout') were using some other names \r\n\r\nIn such cases (these were never reported but is my own experience arising from extensive use) 0 of the time the error saying something about dtype had something to do with dtype. If this happened 10 times, then 9 times it was because of one of the two reasons above. \r\n\r\nCan you check these in your end and see what happens then.

If there is also string (and floats and ints) nothing is converted. \r\n\r\nSo any case where only int and float is present in params dictionary, and as long as there is even a single float, all the values will be converted to float. That's clearly a problem. The issue is created here: \r\n\r\n ```\r\n   def _param_grid(self):\r\n\r\n        '''CREATE THE PARAMETER PERMUTATIONS\r\n\r\n        This is done once before starting the experiment.\r\n        Takes in the parameter dictionary, and returns\r\n        every possible permutation in an array.\r\n        '''\r\n\r\n        ls = [list(self._p[key]) for key in self._p.keys()]\r\n        _param_grid_out = array(list(product(*ls)))\r\n\r\n        return _param_grid_out\r\n```\r\nThe fix is to declare `dtype='object'` in the array creation. It's now merged up until dev. The right version is 0.4.5. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for helping, it's really great to have this bug out.
