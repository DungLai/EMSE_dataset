associations. \r\n\r\nThis originally popped up when I realized that `best_params` is an array, leaving no real clear way of reconstructing the original parameter dictionary associations for storing the parms for replay later.\r\n\r\nThe ask is to simply offer a way of extracting the `best_params` in a format that allows restoration of the values to the original parameter keys.\r\n\r\nBTW, thank you for this module.
