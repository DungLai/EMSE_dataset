I am having troubles optimizing a CNN model for a regression problem in Talos, and can't really figure out what exactly I'm doing wrong. I was following [this instruction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/autonomio/talos/blob/master/examples/Hyperparameter%20Optimization%20with%20Keras%20for%20the%20Iris%20Prediction.ipynb) to set it up.\r\n\r\nMy training and validation data (floats, 50/50 split of the original dataset) look like \r\n```\r\n> x_train.shape\r\n(3145, 250, 1)\r\n> y_train.shape\r\n(3145,)\r\n> x_val.shape\r\n(3146, 250, 1)\r\n> y_val.shape\r\n(3146,)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my Keras model (which is working outside of Talos) is:\r\n```python\r\ndef cnn_model(x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val, params):\r\n\r\n    model = Sequential()\r\n\r\n    model.add(\r\n        Conv1D(\r\n            filters=params['filters'],\r\n            kernel_size=params['kernel_size'],\r\n            activation=params['activation_first'],\r\n            input_shape=(250, 1)))\r\n\r\n    model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=params['pool_size']))\r\n\r\n    model.add(Dropout(rate=params['dropout_rate']))\r\n\r\n    model.add(Flatten())\r\n\r\n    model.add(\r\n        Dense(units=params['units'], activation=params['activation_last']))\r\n\r\n    model.compile(\r\n        loss='mse',\r\n        optimizer=params['optimizer'](\r\n            lr=lr_normalizer(params['lr'], params['optimizer'])),\r\n        metrics=['mse'])\r\n\r\n    out = model.fit(\r\n        gexpr_train_cnn,\r\n        pur_train,\r\n        epochs=20,\r\n        batch_size=300,\r\n        validation_data=[x_val, y_val],\r\n        verbose=0)\r\n\r\n    return out, model\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I define a space of hyperparameters (a simple grid, just to test how Talos works):\r\n```python\r\np = {'lr': [0.1, 0.2],\r\n    'filters': [64, 128],\r\n    'activation_first': ['relu', 'softmax'],\r\n    'activation_last': ['relu', 'softmax'],\r\n    'kernel_size': [9],\r\n    'dropout_rate': [0.1],\r\n    'units': [1],\r\n    'pool_size': [1],\r\n    'optimizer': [Adam]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI scan the grid with\r\n```python\r\nh = ta.Scan(x_train, y_train, params=p, model=cnn_model)\r\n```\r\nwhich completes the scan, and\r\n```python\r\nh.data.head()\r\n```\r\nreturns\r\n```\r\n\tround_epochs\tval_loss\tval_mean_squared_error\tloss\tmean_squared_error\tlr\tfilters\tactivation_first\tactivation_last\tkernel_size\tdropout_rate\tunits\tpool_size\toptimizer\r\n1\t20\t0.24956866435832897\t0.24956866435832897\t0.24007551897180382\t0.24007551897180382\t0.1\t128\tsoftmax\tsoftmax\t9\t0.1\t1\t1\t<class

with different values for **average** and **asc** parameters of **evaluate**, didn't help. \r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, Talos is trying to use f_1 score from sklearn, but this is a classification metric, so it makes sense that it does not work for my data. Is there any way to make it use a regression metric (e.g. mse)? \r\n\r\nOverall, could you please help me to resolve this?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nEgor","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/455082831","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/149#issuecomment-455082831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/149","id":455082831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTA4MjgzMQ==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T08:22:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T08:22:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Basically we need to have a dictionary for the best parameters as opposed to array.
