The error message is same in both examples you provided: \r\n\r\n`ValueError: Unknown activation function:[<function relu at 0x000002D8012F0840>, <function tanh at 0x000002D8012F08C8>, <function sigmoid at 0x000002D8012F0950>, <function linear at 0x000002D8012F0AE8>, <function elu at 0x000002D8012F0620>]`\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, you are passing a list into the Talos input model.\r\n\r\nThis is not an error message caused by malfunction in Talos, but by the attempt to include parameters in the input model in an unsupported way. \r\n\r\nTo avoid doubt, the use logic requires you to pass a params dictionary into the input model, and then everything else is handled by Talos. The name of the params dictionary inside the input model have to follow the name of the argument in the input model.
