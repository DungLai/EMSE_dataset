yes. \r\n\r\nTo further build on this and clarify, the experiment gives us a codified version of the permutation space, for example: \r\n\r\n```\r\n    p = {'batch_size': [20, 30, 40, 50],\r\n         'first_neuron': [10, 20, 30]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...where p is the _experiment_ (level-1) representation of permutation space. As I see it, from here we use the most efficient possible means to create all the possible permutations thereof. That might be the approach you had created. \r\n\r\nThen we might immediately limit it by using one of the limiters (repetition from above):\r\n\r\n1) limit by sample (e.g. no more than 1% of all)\r\n2) limit by round (e.g. no more than 100 permutations)\r\n3) limit by time (e.g. start the last permutation at 8 am)\r\n4) limit by metric (e.g. stop when 'f1_score > 0.9)\r\n\r\nHere we can see that we require three kinds of access through a simple API to the \"parameter space\" (I prefer using this term over \"permutation grid\" as it will make some think ah ok, Talos is just grid search). One more language related point here is that inside \"parameter space\" we have \"parameter permutations\" or simply \"permutations\". \r\n\r\n- to randomly pick based on index (the parameter space object has an arbitrary ordinal index)\r\n- to limit by number of permutations (the parameter space object has a counter) \r\n- to limit by time (the parameter space object has a timer) \r\n- to limit by boolean statement (the parameter space object allows lambda filtering)\r\n- to limit by metric (the parameter space object allows search and retrieval)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in other words, we have ParamsSpace class which is basically a self-contained solution that does all this completely stand-alone from everything else in Talos, and provides an end-point for: \r\n\r\na1) accept as input level-1 object (params dictionary)\r\nr1) return as output level-2 object (parameter space)\r\n\r\nThe object that is returned in `r1` contains the end-points related to level-2 operations: \r\n\r\na2) accept as input a 1-dimensional array/list  \r\nr2) return as output parameter space with parameter permutations corresponding to index values\r\n\r\na3) accepts as input an integer \r\nr3) returns as output parameter space limited to a corresponding number of parameter permutations\r\n\r\na4) accepts as input a timestamp\r\nr4) returns as output a parameter space where the object contains attribute \"stop_time\"\r\n\r\na5) accepts as input a boolean statement / lambda function\r\nr5) returns as output a parameter space limited to a corresponding set of parameter permutations\r\n\r\na6) accepts as input a metric and float value\r\nr6) returns as output a parameter space where the object contains attribute \"metric_name\" and \"metric_value\"\r\n\r\nNote that the parameter space object always has the attributes (e.g. stop_time) but they are None. Making the whole process self-contained in such a way will notably streamline the way in which the currently most confusing, and arguably the most important, aspect of Talos is handled. This way it will be straightforward to think about the process, to make changes, and to add new related capabilities. \r\n\r\nFinally, level-3 changes will be 100% reliant on `a5/r5` end-point. So as long as the above stands, then there is no further consideration to anything else.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/469644199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/469669865","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/256#issuecomment-469669865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/256","id":469669865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTY2OTg2NQ==","user":{"login":"JohanMollevik","id":43040671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQwNjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43040671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik","html_url":"https://github.com/JohanMollevik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohanMollevik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T12:57:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T12:57:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I must addmitt that I did not realy follow that explanation.

I struggled a bit when I thought about it, but ended up with the conclusion that it would still be meaningful to have everything in one self-contained object. In the Talos context it seems that both \"limit by time\" and \"limit by metric\" are associated with the parameter space object more than anything else. Also to have all _limits_ in one object will allow just a single line of code in Scan() which is ideal.

nice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T10:20:20Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T10:20:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/264","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/264/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/264/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/264/events","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/264","id":418231689,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTgyMzE2ODk=","number":264,"title":"Talos

related with #256. \r\n\r\nFor the past few days I've been working on a major overhaul of the codebase. Over the past few months I've noticed three things:\r\n\r\n- there are parts of the code that are rather cryptic\r\n- some things (like inferring metric names) are done many times\r\n- the mainline code is all over the place (goes from here to there in a way that is difficult to follow) \r\n\r\nI've thought, as part of this process, some basic conventions for going forward. \r\n\r\n- /commands contains one file per command (end-user command)\r\n- /scan contains everything related with Scan\r\n- /reducers contains all kinds of limits and reducers \r\n- if the file name is *_run.py it represents the main procedural code of that aspect\r\n- if the file name is * _prepare.py or *_prepare.py it is called only from corresponding *_run.py\r\n- in all other cases, the docstring has to start with \"Called from path/function.py\" \r\n- imports outside of talos are made inside each function below doctstring\r\n- imports outside of talos must contain a two letter prefix e.g. `import numpy as np`\r\n- import outside of talos may alternatively be in the form `import numpy`\r\n- NOTE: it's absolutely prohibited to perform absolute imports e.g. `from numpy import array`\r\n- imports from inside talos are made immediately before the corresponding line of code\r\n- import from inside talos are always absolute imports (to disclose the full path to the originating code)\r\n- a reducer (e.g. correlation) is a single self-contained function in its own file\r\n- a reducer accepts self from Scan() only and returns `value` and `label` only where label is the parameter label and value is the parameter value\r\n\r\n...more to come. Before releasing this overhaul, I will write up a wiki entry with comprehensive information conventions / standards etc. ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4104952418,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQxMDQ5NTI0MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/4104952418","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-12T21:51:53Z","label":{"name":"move-to-docs","color":"000000"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4104952610,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDEwNDk1MjYxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/4104952610","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-12T21:51:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
