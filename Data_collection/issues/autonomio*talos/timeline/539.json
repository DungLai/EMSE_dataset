So for example, you might have something like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nparam_dict = {\r\n    ...\r\n    'custom_hidden_layer': ['a', 'b']\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then your input model:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef input_model():\r\n    ...\r\n    if params['custom_hidden_layer'] == 'a':\r\n        some_layer()\r\n    elif params['custom_hidden_layer'] == 'b':\r\n        some_other_layer()\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n```\r\nIt's useful to keep in mind that Talos is very flexible in the way it allows you to create any custom functions inside the input model :)
