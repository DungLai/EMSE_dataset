Saving the keras model after each round in the experiment is super simple, but it gets a little bit murky after that. For example, straight out of the box is not supported to take such a stored model and make predictions with it. This has to do with tensorflow backend and the way Keras handles (or is not handling in this case) it. It would be best to do this properly once and for all, but as that might take some time (it's not a priority at the moment) I could of course allow storing the model after each round. But I think that if you do do that, you will run into the tensorflow graph problems as well.
