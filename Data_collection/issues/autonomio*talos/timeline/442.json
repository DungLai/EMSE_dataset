running `Scan` to perform a search in the parameters space, there is no option to assess accuracy or other metrics using K-Fold cross-validation.\r\n\r\nAs such, when the model is sensitive to the dataset split (one reason could be there are few samples), the calculated accuracy used to select the best model has little meaning.\r\n\r\nEach run provides a vastly different result and no ideal candidate can be identified.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add cross-validation using KFold directly when running `Scan` in order to have a solid accuracy metric for the investigated candidates?\r\n\r\nI modified the workflow a tad to run each candidate more than once (with a `fraction_limit` > 1) and processing the data to compute the mean of each metric from the same parameters set, but they all use the same data split so it's not cross-validation.\r\n\r\nOne could imagine running `Scan` first to generate all candidate models, then performing `Evaluate` with KFold cross-validation on each of the candidates, maybe?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: just came accross `evaluate_models` from the Scan object.. Could be that it does what I need, even if it means running it on all models.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
