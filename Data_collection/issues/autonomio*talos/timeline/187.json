\"reproducibility\" with deep learning models. Basically you're able to reproduce results only when the model is not changed (no retraining) and you apply exactly the same dataset to it. So if the model is the same, and the dataset is the same, you get exactly the same result. Otherwise you will not get the same result. Just because you train the model with exactly the same hyperparameters does not mean you end up with exactly the same result because there is an element of randomness involved in the process.

Each of these constitute a Keras model with a given configuration. Within dataset-A you have two results; training results (e.g. acc and loss) and validation results (e.g. val_acc and val_loss). \r\n\r\nThen when you access the `scan_object.best_model(metric='val_acc')` it goes to the results of the experiment (as per above) and takes saved model based on 'val_acc' and activates it so you can use it for making predictions. \r\n\r\nSo now you have a model, and you know how that model have performed in training and validation with dataset-A. If you now input some other dataset to it, say dataset-B you will not get the same result, nor should you get it. That's the first part of this, just to make sure it's clear. \r\n\r\nThe second part relates with `accuracy_score`. If this is from sklearn, then it is a known issue that it will not give the same result for you as the internal keras accuracy. In that case maybe [this issue](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/9672) is relevant. But you can find many more in Stackoverflow and elsewhere. \r\n\r\nAlso, don't worry, you'll end up hitting a lot of snags as a researcher ... we are after all operating in a vanguard area of numerical computing ... but generally it's straightforward to overcome whatever issues may face in this field :) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/457507706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/457513414","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/187#issuecomment-457513414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/187","id":457513414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzUxMzQxNA==","user":{"login":"davide1993","id":19341977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzQxOTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19341977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993","html_url":"https://github.com/davide1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T09:37:50Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T09:37:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I use the same train, validation and test in all the experiments, this is sure.

I've looked into it now. \r\n\r\nThe way scan_object.data and the accompanying .csv gets the results from metrics is through the history object that comes out from model.fit() in Keras. There are two modes in which Talos can do this: \r\n\r\n- based on highest epoch (which is default)\r\n- based on last epoch(you have to set` Scan( ... last_epoch_value=True ... )`)\r\n\r\nAs I have seen, in your model you are currently using `last_epoch_value=False` which means you are unlikely to ever get exactly the same result from evaluation as you will get from the Scan() results. I think based on this experience, we will have it True by default going forward. Still then you will end up with the problem, which has to do with Keras, where whatever you have as your last epoch metrics, is not going to be the same as the one you get from evaluate (or accuracy_score from sklearn). For example, I tried with your configuration and made the corresponding Keras model directly instead of using Talos, and the last epoch result is roughly 2% different from what both evaluate and accuracy_score gives. \r\n\r\nAs I now know what you are looking for and your data, I can confirm that this is not an issue in Talos, and even though it is something that is known about Keras (there are many issues discussing this), I'm not sure it can be considered an issue because the last epoch training result and evaluation are really not the same thing. **You get exactly the same level of reproducibility with Talos as you get with Keras. There is absolutely no difference.**  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/457906620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/458539146","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/187#issuecomment-458539146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/187","id":458539146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODUzOTE0Ng==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T13:28:03Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T13:28:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As this is not a bug and the case is resolved, closing here.
