right I totally agree. There's got to be an easy way for the program to detect whether or not its running in a notebook or not. Regardless, since there are some notebooks that don't play nice with these progress bars, we should implement some default behavior first. Something like what you suggested should work great! Particularly, maybe something that constantly overwrites the first output line so we don't overwhelm the user with a ton of output.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/408613337/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1758563780,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc1ODU2Mzc4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1758563780","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-28T14:56:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1758563781,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NTg1NjM3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1758563781","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-28T14:56:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/408669780","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/19#issuecomment-408669780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/19","id":408669780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODY2OTc4MA==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-29T11:25:26Z","updated_at":"2018-07-29T11:2
