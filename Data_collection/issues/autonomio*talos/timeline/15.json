It seems that this is not going to work without some modifications. I'm not sure yet what those modifications would be (as I don't want to change the main line code for this) so I'm going think out load here a little first. \r\n\r\nIt seems that the issue is in the way a typical model is measured; one model permutation yields one accuracy. Here the case is that each observation yields one accuracy, and then we take average of that in the end. Typically we would have one permutation processed, get the accuracy and then move on to the next permutation, and then in the end pick the best one/s. Here we'd have the case where we'd need to choose if we want to a) repeat the process as you have it in your code, but do it once per permutation, or if we wanted to go through permutations sample by sample. That seems to be the main question here i.e. to do this sample-by-sample and then in the end stitch it together, or do it model-by-model. Sample-by-sample is closer to the current working, but model-by-model makes the accuracy part simpler to do it seems. But because the accuracy part is trivial and does not affect the code much, it seems that sample-by-sample is the preferred approach (even though it seems counter intuitive initially). Does it make sense? \r\n\r\nI'm sorry that at this point it's not going to immediately solve your problem, but it seems worthwhile to figure out the best way to do this, and have it as a feature.

We could trust our 59 models, show them our test image (the 60th image), get its probas and take the mean. We could blindly trust that naive assumption.\r\n\r\nWe could also do something more accurate and proffesional. Once we get all those 59 overfitted models, we could train another meta-classifier (LogisticRegressor) that would be trained on the probas that every image gets from all the 58 other overfitted classifiers. The 60th image (test data) would be transformed to that same standard and be shown to that meta-classifier.\r\n\r\nBut in both these solutions we just end up with a somewhat vaguely accurate accuracy and never get a configuration of parameters from our CNN that we can say is near to optimal.\r\n\r\nWe are still far from a solution but at least we got something!
