I reproduced the steps that talos performs on the `self.result` object and that's what I get:\r\n\r\n\t>>> l = ['10,20,30,test', '4,5,6,test2']\r\n\t>>> df = pd.DataFrame(l)\r\n\t>>> df.dtypes\r\n\t0    object\r\n\tdtype: object\r\n\t>>> res = df[df.columns[0]].str.split(',', expand=True)\r\n\t>>> res\r\n\t    0   1   2      3\r\n\t0  10  20  30   test\r\n\t1   4   5   6  test2\r\n\t>>> res.sort_values(0, ascending=True)\r\n\t    0   1   2      3\r\n\t0  10  20  30   test\r\n\t1   4   5   6  test2\r\n\r\nAs you can see the sort puts 10 before 4, which means it's considered as a string.\r\n\r\nUnless you obtain different dtypes from talos in your case, it seems obvious this is a bug and we are missing a step to restore the correct dtypes to each column after splitting the comma-separated strings. Could be possibly done with [infer_objects()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.infer_objects.html).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/462737668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"beeb","id":703631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzYzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb","html_url":"https://github.com/beeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beeb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2133549310,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxMzM1NDkzMTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/2133549310","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-12T12:28:25Z","label":{"name":"moderate
