I had not done a custom Keras metric before, so needed to learn a couple of things. As it stands, I did not find a way to get the length / number of observations inside the metric for y_pred and y_true which is needed for the split. Otherwise everything is working already. I've posted an issue on Keras and also a question on StackOverflow (as I had already tried ~10 different methods and none returned the actual length of the underlying data for y_pred and y_true). I prefer doing it 100% using Keras backend.\r\n\r\nBasically the way this would work is that there are several custom metrics (I think accuracy, f1, and mae at first) which support cross-validation for every epoch.
