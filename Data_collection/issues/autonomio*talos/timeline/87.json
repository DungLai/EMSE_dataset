What I am am trying to do outside of Talos is replicating what Talos is doing but manually. I am currently working with about 10% of my data (derived from fMRI) as I tweak the preprocessing of the data. I used the full 10% as input for talos (with the 80/20 split). I used the exact same data outside of Talos. The only reason I'm doing this is because the sample is small and I'm just making sure things are more or less working for when I have the actual full dataset ready.\r\n\r\nToday I ran a simple test where I had Talos randomly search for 0.01 scans and give me the results. Then, I replicated the 14 scans manually  with a train_test_split (80/20) in a similar fashion to what Talos does.  The code I used is all above, all I changed were the model variables. When I import the data `X, Y = import_data()` I'm importing the exact same data for Talos and for my manual tests.\r\n\r\nThe results are attached. I added two columns to the Talos csv output: manual validation accuracy; and manual validation f measure. It seams like the fmeasure doesn't change significantly, but the accuracy is quite a bit lower. I would expect, just by chance, that these results would not differ, as I'm just manually replicating what Talos is doing automatically (supposedly) - I think the issue might be with the way I'm replicating the models/scans manually.\r\n\r\nLet me know and thanks for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n[LA5s_1.xlsx](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/files/2348376/LA5s_1.xlsx)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/418330052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vascosa","id":32845478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODQ1NDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32845478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa","html_url":"https://github.com/vascosa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vascosa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/418416393","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/87#issuecomment-418416393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/87","id":418416393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODQxNjM5Mw==","user":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T15:41:16Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T15:41:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"`I think the issue might be with the way I'm replicating the models/scans manually.`\r\n\r\nIt very well might be. Additionally, looking at your final loss and accuracy, it appears to me that you're over-fitting quite a bit. If this is true, then it is unlikely you're going to be able to produce reproducible results upon training since each time you train you'll be tailoring your model to the training data or the model itself. Sometimes you'll get lucky and have similar-enough validation data, and other times you won't, hence the large variance.\r\n\r\nHere's my recommendation to help you pin down the potential problem with Talos first. First, do a three-way stratified (equal proportion of each class in each chunk) split. One for training (~80%) one for validation (~10%) one for testing (~10%). Manually specify the input validation data into Talos so you know exactly how your data is being split. Run the hyper-parameter tuning on a reproducible chunk of your hyperparameter space (meaning, specify in the parameter variable - the input to Talos - only the hyperparameter permutations you want and do not use any reduction of the hyperparameter space). See what the results are like. Then, pick the best model, retrain on those hyperparameters with only the training data, and finally evaluate on the testing data (that should be the end-all result you report). To confirm everything is working properly, then you can try manually reproducing everything I just mentioned. See if there results are similar!\r\n\r\nAlso, I saw you're using scaling of some sort, but you're scaling the entire data set. Might I ask what the scaler does exactly? Some scalers are only meant to be \"fit\" on the training data, else you risk introducing additional biases.\r\n\r\nI would try to address the over-fitting problem first though, but based on your model you already don't have many parameters to train. You said this was fMRI data. Is this a 2/3d image that has been flattened? If so you might want to consider using a CNN, it could help you generalize a bit better. Sorry if you've thought of these things already, I'm just brainstorming! Not trying to waste your time or anything.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/418416393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1825649515,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MjU2NDk1MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1825649515","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T15:41:33Z","label":{"name":"investigation","color":"c5def5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1825649652,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxODI1NjQ5NjUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1825649652","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T15:41:36Z","assignee":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/418517012","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/87#issuecomment-418517012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/a
