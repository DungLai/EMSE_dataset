This is slightly expanded from the initial scope also. I think we have to consider three kinds of randomness: \r\n\r\n- Pseudo randomness\r\n- Quasi randomness\r\n- True randomness / quantum randomness\r\n\r\nGiven the emphasis we have on random search, I believe it's important to have strong coverage for all three. The differences in terms of output are notable: \r\n\r\n![](https://image.ibb.co/iViTnz/download_5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I've implemented: \r\n\r\n```\r\nr = Randomizer(self.param_log)\r\n\r\nr.sobol() # sobol sequence\r\nr.uniform_crypto() # from secrets\r\nr.uniform_mersenne() # from random\r\nr.latin_matrix() # latin hypercube\r\nr.latin_improved() # improved latin hypercube\r\nr.latin_sudoku() # latin hypercube with sudoku type constraint\r\nr.korobov_matrix() # korobov design matrix\r\nr.halton() # halton sequence\r\nr.quantum() # this is actual quantum mechanics true randomness! :) \r\n```\r\nBased on everything I've studied and see so far, it seems fair to say that not all randomness is created equal. As we get these into use, it will be very interesting to see how things materialize from dataset to dataset. Not all are covered in any literature, and those that are, with very limited datasets.
