I spent sometime seeing if kfold could be directly implemented as a metric in Keras, but I think it's not logical because of the way a Keras metric works. That would been ideal. \r\n\r\nThe other topic you mention is seeing how different validation splits effect. I think that could be a meaningful variable in the experiment together with hyperparameters. Would have to think about it though as it is one level higher in terms of abstraction; we are then abstracting the `Scan()` configuration as opposed to Keras model configuration. This could become part of [`AutoScan`](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/AutoScan) ... check it out if had not already.
