seems that the only thing that needs to change is the way validation split is now handled internally. Two options:\r\n\r\n- add a parameter \"use_generator=True\" \r\n- detect the type of the validation_data parameter \r\n\r\nThen the user will have to pass data in to Scan() slightly differently as well. So this needs to be thought about a little.\r\n\r\nAlso it seems that Keras fit_generator has some memory (leakish) issue which have been reported in many instances, so this will have to be looked in to as well.
