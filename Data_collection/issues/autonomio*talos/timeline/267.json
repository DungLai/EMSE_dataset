[x] I'm up-to-date with the latest release (i.e. v.0.4.9 and all upcoming possibly):\r\n- [x] I've confirmed that my Keras model works outside of Talos.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI found a crucial issue in the result logging (**i.e. `results.py` for all current an upcoming versions**). All results, as well as the headers are stored in a single list, which is the member object `self.result`, or temporary variable `_rr_out` respectively. However, to store the values, the dictionary keys are traversed and concatenated into the list. **And here comes the issue**: Python does not guarantee the order of keys in a dictionary! Therefore, it is possible that values like `acc` may become `acc_val`, or the `loss` value becomes a parameter, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt might be the case that this issue hardly happens for only a few metrics and parameters. But it definitely happens in my exhaustive evaluations with dozens of metrics and parameters.\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue can be very easily fixed by using a dictionary instead of a list for storing the results. I already implemented this feature in my fork: https://github.com/tik0/talos/commit/8db906f0ca8498de963b0e3c787e58a721e9e395\r\n(Please notice that this commit is a forked branch, which comes with disabled stringification (#271), user defined history (#272) and fixed entropy (#268))\r\n\r\nThis is a major issue from my point of view and I will elaborate on a patch for a PR if desired.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2208689684,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMDg2ODk2ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/2208689684","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-17T13:20:06Z","label":{"name":"logging-related","color":"000000"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2266885496,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNjY4ODU0OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/2266885496","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f6b6b187a65dfe138bf3b4c2df7e4c77ad935ada","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/commits/f6b6b187a65dfe138bf3b4c2df7e4c77ad935ada","created_at":"2019-04-10T17:48:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2463418070,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI0NjM0MTgwNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/2463418070","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-05T19:22:15Z","label":{"name":"fixed-daily-dev","color":"daf279"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/508844282","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/267#issuecomment-508844282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/267","id":508844282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODg0NDI4Mg==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkoko
