thanks for clarifying.  It definitely works.  I monitor gpu load, gpu memory usage, temp and fan speed on both cards and all measures indicate both are in use.  Multi GPU support is the main feature which lead me to talos.  \r\n\r\nI was using GridSearch prior, but it seemed multi-gpu on gridsearch failed for me.  I suspect the memory leak issue.  I saw the git version of talos had the method to reset the session between model builds to clear GPU memory.  That worked great in talos.  When I have it sent to false I can cause a memory leak error from doing enough runs in talos.  When I set it to true, talos clears the memory each run.  Confirmed by setting allow growth in tensorflow session to true and the memory clears and grows to needed amount before each run starts on both GPUs.

The nature of my current experiment only utilizes < 50% on both cards.  GridSearch has an n_Jobs option where you can set the total number of parallel permutations to run at the same time.

In that case I think there would need to be more than one session set for each parallel permutation to run in.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if this is even possible.  I can do an initial test by setting the per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.5 and running two terminal sessions at once to see what happens.  My hope is that both will be running and GPUs will be near 100% usage.

,"body":"@Manofdesign @x94carbone \r\n\r\nAs I understand this will be probably the most important think to get right in the roadmap, I'll take a step back and try to dissect. \r\n\r\nIt seems that here we are talking now about bigger picture of resources use. First, we have two kinds of systems:\r\n\r\n- CPU based\r\n- GPU based \r\n\r\nThis is quite important, as for some prediction tasks (e.g. batch_size tends to be small) even a low-end CPU can be an order of magnitude faster than high-end GPU based system. \r\n\r\nThen we have three kinds of distributions: \r\n\r\n- a single resource machine (e.g. a single machine with a single GPU)\r\n- a multi resource machine (e.g. a single machine with many GPUs) \r\n- multi-machine, single-resources (e.g. many machines, each with single GPU) \r\n- multi-machine, multi-resource (e.g. many machines, each with many GPUs) \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if multi-CPU utilization is as effective out-of-the-box as CPU core utilization is with Keras/TensorFlow, or is it more like multi-GPU case. \r\n\r\nIn terms of experiments, we have several scenarios: \r\n\r\n- a single experiment run as a single job \r\n- a single experiment run as multiple jobs\r\n- multiple experiments run as a single job \r\n- multiple experiments run as multiple jobs\r\n\r\nI appreciate the fact that multiple experiments run as a single job might not be relevant, but I'm including it for the sake of ontological completeness regarding this topic. \r\n\r\nBasically we are left with 2x4x3=12 relevant cases to figure out and make sure that we cover each in a meaningful way. I think the most complex will be \"distributed\" scenario where we have multiple machines with multiple GPUs. \r\n\r\nThe other interesting thing here might be (at least for very long runs) to have a switch for automatically choosing a given system if CPU, GPU (or TPU) should be used. For example, I have a case where on Google colab it takes 10s per permutation for CPU, 70s/p with GPU and 40s per permutation with TPU. So it would be very easy for the system to auto-optimize and pick CPU for the experiment without the user having to worry about it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/426655520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1882041085,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4MjA0MTA4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1882041085","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-03T14:20:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1882041086,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4ODIwNDEwODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1882041086","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-03T14:20:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1882041090,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4MjA0MTA5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1882041090","actor":{"login":"Manofdesign","id":43456962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDU2OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43456962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign","html_url":"https://github.com/Manofdesign","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manofdesign/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-03T14:20:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
