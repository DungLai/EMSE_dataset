off, make sure to check your [support options](https://github.com/autonomio/talos#-how-to-get-support).\r\n\r\nThe preferred way to resolve usage related matters is through the [docs](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/) which are maintained up-to-date with the latest version of Talos.\r\n\r\nIf you do end up asking for support in a new issue, make sure to follow the below steps carefully.\r\n\r\n#### 1) Confirm the below\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have looked for an answer in the [Docs](https://autonomio.github.io/talos)\r\n- [ X] My Python version is 3.5 or higher\r\n**3.7.9**\r\n\r\n- [ X] I have searched through the issues [Issues](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues) for a duplicate\r\n- [X ] I've tested that my Keras model works as a stand-alone\r\n\r\n#### 2) Include the output of:\r\n\r\n`talos.__version__`\r\n**0.6.4**\r\n\r\n#### 3) Explain clearly what you are trying to achieve\r\n\r\n*A description of your specific use-case and what you hope to achieve with it*\r\nHello Mikko Kotila, I earlier asked issue # [504](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/504). Thanks i was somehow able to make it work. But then i realized my laptop was giving me screen of death due to memory issue so i searched online and figured out i should try using fit_generator instead of fit. So  right now i am trying that but since i was busy lately so could not take up that project. Now when i am trying fit_generator and i am getting error. Since i m still new to python/machine learning i think it could be more of python issue than talos issue but any assistance would be of great help.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 4) Explain what you have already tried\r\nI was able to make keras standalone (without talos) to work with a single set of parameters. But problem happens when i try setting up parameter dictonary and then run the scan. Just for sake of it i tried changing multiple ways like a) Giving only set of parameter b) parameter giving as a list . Both the times i get different error. When using a) (i.e. only one set of value) i get error as \r\n**TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'list'**\r\nwhen using b) (i.e. list of values for parameters) i get error as\r\n**ValueError: The `kernel_size` argument must be a tuple of 1 integers. Received: [2, 4, 6]**\r\n\r\n*An outline of the steps that you have already taken so far*\r\n\r\n#### 5) Provide a code-complete reference\r\n\r\n- [ X] My support question includes an input model\r\n- [ X] My support question includes a parameter dictionary\r\n- [X ] My support question includes a `Scan()` command\r\n- [ ] My support question includes a link to a sample of the data\r\n(I havent provided this because for that i need to import data to google drive and i dont have enough space but if required i will make some way to do this\r\n\r\nNOTE: If the data is sensitive and can't be shared, [create dummy data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#samples-generator) that mimics it.\r\n\r\n**A self-contained Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or similar is highly preferred and will speed up helping you with your issue.**\r\n\r\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Twssq_MiQ4RxMZ69A595SFIgs4JhG18u?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
