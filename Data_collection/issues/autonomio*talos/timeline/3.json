I think that would be great. I've fixed the link above. \r\n\r\nRight now the performance.py implements a modified version of f1 score that is \"better\" than regular f1 score in two ways: \r\n\r\n- it avoids high score in the corner cases that actually warrant poor scores\r\n- it works exactly the same for both binary and multi-class tasks (this is through dealing with both prediction outputs in the same manner) \r\n\r\nThe question would be if this can be reasonably converted into a Keras metric with the same logic. Or is it perhaps better to take as a base the keras fmeasure_acc [here](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/blob/master/talos/metrics/keras_metrics.py) and make the modifications to it based on the performance.py. \r\n\r\nThen the second step would be to identify a similar \"best of class\" objective measure for continuous prediction tasks, and have that in both python (as we have performance.py now) and keras versions (for callbacks). \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
