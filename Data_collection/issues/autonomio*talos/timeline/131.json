I think [Horodov](https://github.com/uber/horovod) looks very promising and @manofdesign mentioned that he is looking at implementing it. Multi-machine parallelization is definitely an important development track and it will be important to cover it well.

Background\r\n\r\nAt times it's beneficial to be able to distribute the experiment to more than one host. A typical use-case is where the researcher has access to more than one host machines on a local network or then in a cloud environment such as AWS.\r\n\r\n## Guiding Principles\r\n\r\n- Use a modern distribution library for python\r\n- It must allow distribution of experiments without changing any of the current Talos codes\r\n- It must live in the `talos` namespace as `talos.distribute` or `talos.Distribute`\r\n\r\n## How will it work\r\n\r\nRight now Talos experiment works in the following way: \r\n\r\nA.1) The experiment consists of a given number of permutations to go through\r\nA.2) After each permutation, a log entry is made onto the host (local or otherwise) running the experiment\r\nA.3) At the end of the experiment, the results can be viewed in the experiment log (a CSV file)\r\n\r\nThe way a distributed Talos experiment works: \r\n\r\nB.1) The experiment consists of a given number of permutations to go through (let this `P`)\r\nB.2) The experiment is distributed across a given number of machines (let this be `D`)\r\nB.3) Each individual machine will handle `P`/`D` randomly picked permutations \r\nB.4) Each individual machine will operate exactly as in `A.1` through `A.3`\r\nB.5) At the end of the experiment, the experiment logs from each individual machine are combined into one file\r\n\r\nOther than the permutations, each individual machine follows the logic exactly as instructed in `talos.Scan()` to start the experiment. \r\n\r\n`talos.Distribute()` should accept as its input, `talos.Scan()` in where the experiment is configured following the Talos way. `talos.Distribute()` should only accept arguments that are directly related with the distribution.\r\n\r\n## Central Datastore\r\n\r\nWhatever is logged in the `experiment_log` CSV during the experiment, is updated in a central psql datastore. This can be every minute or a continuous stream based on updates in the CSVs on each node. Note that a `model_id` must be generated based on the row number in the CSV combined with a `node_id` so it becomes a unique identifier of the model in the central datastore.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It's useful here to keep in mind that we want to later implement epoch-by-epoch updates live from a Callback. So with that in mind, we might also look at something like MaterializeDB as the next step.\r\n\r\n## What this is not\r\n\r\n- It is not a way to distribute TensorFlow model training\r\n- It is not a way to distribute Talos experiments on a single host machine (which is handled in autonomio/talos#55)\r\n\r\n## Historically related Issues\r\n\r\nNOTE: These are provided simply as a historical reference, not as a guide.\r\n\r\n- autonomio/talos#100\r\n- autonomio/talos#131 \r\n- autonomio/talos#332","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/jako/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/jako/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/1032488336","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/131#issuecomment-1032488336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/131","id":1032488336,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-ECn849ioWQ","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T11:09:13Z","updated_at":"2022-04-15T17:45:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging with autonomio/jako#10 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/1032488336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6025925405,"node_id":"CE_lADOB-ECn84WvpJ8zwAAAAFnLFMd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/6025925405","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-08T11:09:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
