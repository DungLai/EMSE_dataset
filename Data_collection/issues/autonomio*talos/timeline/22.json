after many terribly organized private repos, I have been inspired to think about this in the context of my own personal workflow and also for collaborating. @mikkokotila I'm sure you've also thought about this, but I figured why not have it here as a comment as well. Here's a proposal for the general workflow for a user, inspired by [Vincent Driessen's blog post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).\r\n\r\n1. Contributor (user) forks `autonomo/talos` to `origin/talos`.\r\n2. user clones `origin/talos` to `local`, sets upstream branch to point to `autonomio/talos` (via `git remote add upstream ...`, where `...` is the address you see when you click on the git clone button on `autonomio/talos`) and then checks out to `dev`.\r\n3. Immediately `git checkout -b my_feature_branch`. All work on a new feature is done on this branch or its children.\r\n4. Bugfixes can be directly implemented on `dev`.\r\n5. When work is done on `my_feature_branch`, user can check out to `local/dev` and ensure `dev` is up to date (`git pull upstream dev`), and then merge on their local branch: `git merge --no-ff my_feature_branch`, resolve any merge conflicts, then `git push origin dev` and open a PR. This PR will be `origin/dev > autonomo/dev`.\r\n6. Resolve any conflicts with PR if any remain, then work is done.\r\n\r\nThe general rules could be as follows:\r\n- Nobody, even with permission, pushes anything directly to `master`. Anything to be merged into master should be resolved via PR (I think this is good practice).\r\n- Feature updates do not get pushed directly to master (so basically, don't do what my last PR just did). They are only pushed to `dev`.\r\n- When a new release is ready, open a PR `dev > master` to resolve any final bug fixes.\r\n- One more final check before `master > production` to update pypi.\r\n- In principle, the only branches on `autonomio` that should exist in perpetuity are `master`, `dev` and `production`.\r\n- `dev` as stated already, is meant for development and can be kinda a sandbox for resolving conflicts and adding new features.\r\n- `master` is the next level up in development, so while not being in production it should be close to that stage. (**Suggestion:** I think we can do away with the production branch if you want, if we reserve `master` for production).\r\n- `production` is currently the final stage for distributing the package.\r\n\r\nWhew that was a lot! Thoughts/did I miss anything here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/407404310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1750146175,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc1MDE0NjE3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1750146175","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-24T13:22:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1750146176,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NTAxNDYxNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/1750146176","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-24T13:22:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/408481286","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/22#issuecomment-408481286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/22","id":408481286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODQ4MTI4Ng==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-27T17:09:08Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T17:09:
