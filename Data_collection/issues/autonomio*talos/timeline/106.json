For functional model, have you tried `ta.Scan(functional_support=True)` already? \r\n\r\nAlso can see your version is >0.4 as last week there was a big update to both dev and master and now all branches are more or less in sync including pypi.\r\n\r\nRegarding regression problems, I will do some testing today and report back. Should definitely have this resolved no later than tomorrow, it's critical that we support regression problems as much as classification problems (even thought they are generally rarer).
