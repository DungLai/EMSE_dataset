for the co-operation. I've tested your model and it produces exactly the right h.data (the Scan() object dataframe) and exactly the right csv. \r\n\r\nI'm almost sure there is something in your system that refers to a wrong talos version. If you can create an AWS/google instance, you would be able to verify this easily by running your code there. \r\n\r\nHere is the code I've used to generate the data that is accepted by your model. As the first step, you could try it with your model in the system that yields the issue. Just to eradicate the doubt that the input data would somehow effect the headings.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom keras.utils import to_categorical\r\n\r\ndata = np.random.randint(0, 4, 12)\r\ny_train = to_categorical(data)\r\ny_val = to_categorical(data)\r\n\r\nX_train = np.random.random((12, 200))\r\nX_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1)\r\nX_val = X_train\r\n\r\n```\r\nOther than that, I've used your model exactly like you had provided, except for one more thing. I'm using `grid_downsample=0.02` to make the test pass instantly.
