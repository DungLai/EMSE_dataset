no_of_steps e.g. (0, 1, 6) which will add values 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5\r\n- as a list with a single value e.g. [200] which will add 200\r\n\r\nThat said, when you say \"build parameter space in

now the way things work is that we have to important components to consider: \r\n\r\n1) all possible permutations \r\n2) the simplest possible index \r\n\r\nThe index serves the purpose of keeping track of permutations that have been already explored, or for some other reason are to be ignored. This approach is beneficial in two important ways. \r\n\r\na) any function, random or otherwise, that outputs an integer can be used to pick or ignore items in the permutations \r\nb) we entirely avoid the need for performing operations in the permutation space (which might be big) \r\n\r\nOut of all components / decisions in Talos, this is the one that is most connected with the mainline program. The current approach, related with (b), had been selected with great care to allow very large permutation space. It's meaningful to know that it fails at 10^16. So the first action item here would be to find out at which order of magnitude things stop working. \r\n\r\nThis is just to share with you the background i.e. whatever is in place, had been selected for a reason, and any changes to the parameter grid aspect are closely connected with the mainline program (as well some important ideas about future development). \r\n\r\nI'm not averse to well structured proposals for something better, as long as those proposals appreciate the background I had provided. Obviously there are finer details that would have to be discussed as part of the process. If you are interested in contributing, I whole heartedly welcome it. \r\n\r\nRelated with your specific case in the example, I think that with number of neurons a strict one-by-one progression in parameters might not be warranted. In your case, just by changing that your case falls within the supported order of magnitude.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/464740656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/464746213","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/201#issuecomment-464746213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/201","id":464746213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDc0NjIxMw==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-18T14:15:04Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T14:15:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To update, I did some quick test and it does appear that around 10^8 things become slow in a low end laptop machine. But just for the period `_param_grid_out = array(list(product(*ls)), dtype='object')` is run as immediately upon completion the memory is released mostly. It took about 1 minute to process with a machine that has few gigs of available ram and low-end CPU. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking if there is some meaningful way we can support large permutation spaces without changing anything else i.e. is there a step of random picking we can add before we run `_param_grid_out = array(list(product(*ls)), dtype='object')` that reduces the workload down to say 10^8. Because we are anyway downsampling, it seems to make no difference if we can come up with a meaningful way to do that. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? \r\n\r\nI'm going to label this as \"must have\" for the part that we should support large theoretical parameter grids.
