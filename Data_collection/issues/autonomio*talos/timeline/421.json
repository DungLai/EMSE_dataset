I understand now what is the problem; Keras for some reason does not allow loading model from json if the name of an object (e.g. layer) is unknown to it. \r\n\r\nIt is anyhow possible to find the best models from the experiment and \"recover\" the models. Because this is kind of a case that can come up for several reasons, I've added a utility for doing it in a straightforward manner. You can access it by upgrading to `v0.6.4` with: \r\n\r\n`pip install git+https://github.com/autonomio/talos`\r\n\r\nIt will work on experiment log from any previous Talos version as well. I've created [a code-complete notebook](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/blob/master/examples/Recover%20Best%20Models%20from%20Experiment%20Log.ipynb) that outlines the process you can follow to get to cross-validated results for n models, as well as the models themselves. It does involve re-training n models, which depending on your architecture and system configuration may take longer than merely evaluating best models from the `scan_object` would. \r\n\r\nRelated with the underlying problem you suffer from, I'm not sure why Keras is doing a string check, as the meaningful part of the model is stored in the weights and not in the json. Might be a good idea to post this issue separately to [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues) in case someone there warms up to the idea of making this go away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/535672465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2666595604,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNjY2NTk1NjA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/2666595604","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-26T20:25:49Z","assignee":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/535701247","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/421#issuecomment-535701247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/421","id":535701247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTcwMTI0Nw==","user":{"login":"bjtho08","id":885853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTg1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/885853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08","html_url":"https://github.com/bjtho08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T21:56:27Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T22:13:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the comprehensive response.

Here I randomly chose `012621170617.csv` just to see if this workaround works, but it failed anyways)\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, here is my `model.compile()` (it is a multi-task learning model)\r\n```\r\n my_model_custom_vae.compile( loss ={'decoder.Model': 'mse' , 'out.reg.vae':'mse'}\r\n                                ,loss_weights = {'out.reg.vae': input_params['loss_wieghts_layer_outReg'], 'decoder.Model':input_params['loss_wieghts_layer_decoderModel']} \r\n                                ,optimizer = myoptimizer_adam\r\n                                , metrics= {'out.reg.vae':[func_correlation_coefficient], 'decoder.Model':[func_correlation_coefficient]}\r\n                               )\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/768607159","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/421#issuecomment-768607159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/421","id":768607159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODYwNzE1OQ==","user":{"login":"bjtho08","id":885853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTg1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/885853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08","html_url":"https://github.com/bjtho08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-27T22:00:26Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T22:00:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> What I tried:\r\n> First, I `Analyze` the `scan_object` to find the round w/ best result using `rounds2high`.

That means you can't chain them together as you did here. That would only work if `activate_model()` was a method in a class instance named `best_model`. Second, `activate_model()` takes one positional argument. Now, I don't know how you get that specific syntax error, because you are supplying two arguments, where the first argument is a `set` containing a Scan object and a `dict` with a custom layer as the `item` and the second argument is the model number.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't have direct access to my own code atm, but if I remember correctly, what I did as a work-around for this particular issue was to simply use the underlying code for the various methods. So for instance, to get the best model and then re-load it, I used\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom keras.models import model_from_json\r\nfrom myswish import Swish\r\n\r\nmy_activations = {\r\n    'Swish': Swish,\r\n}\r\n\r\nbest = scan_object.data.sort_values('val_acc', ascending=False).iloc[0].name\r\nmodel = model_from_json(self.saved_models[best], custom_objects=my_activations)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you just substitute whatever your `dict` of custom objects is named and change the sorting column if needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/768607159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bjtho08","id":885853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTg1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/885853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08","html_url":"https://github.com/bjtho08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjtho08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-12T20:50:39Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T20:50:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/580","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/580/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/580/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/580/events","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/580","id":1201876529,"node_id":"I_kwDOB-ECn85Hoy4x","number":580,"title":"Getting
