Right now you are for example declaring: \r\n\r\n`'lr': (0.5, 5)`\r\n\r\nBut it can't be like that, because the third value is missing. So you could say: \r\n\r\n`'lr': (0.5, 5, 10)`\r\n\r\n...which would include 10 different values in the range between 0.5 and 5. When you use tuple input format it is in the form (start, end, no_of_steps). \r\n\r\nAlso you have:\r\n\r\n`'dropout': (0, 0.1, 0.2),`\r\n\r\n...which following the same logic can't work as the last is float and can't be no_of_steps. For batch_size maybe you want to `[100, 500, 1000]` instead of `(100, 500, 1000)`. When you use list in this way, you just include those 3 discrete values.
