[x] I'm up-to-date with the latest release (i.e. v.0.4.9 and all upcoming possibly):\r\n- [x] I've confirmed that my Keras model works outside of Talos.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI found a crucial issue in the result logging (**i.e. `results.py` for all current an upcoming versions**). All results, as well as the headers are stored in a single list, which is the member object `self.result`, or temporary variable `_rr_out` respectively. However, to store the values, the dictionary keys are traversed and concatenated into the list. **And here comes the issue**: Python does not guarantee the order of keys in a dictionary! Therefore, it is possible that values like `acc` may become `acc_val`, or the `loss` value becomes a parameter, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt might be the case that this issue hardly happens for only a few metrics and parameters. But it definitely happens in my exhaustive evaluations with dozens of metrics and parameters.\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue can be very easily fixed by using a dictionary instead of a list for storing the results. I already implemented this feature in my fork: https://github.com/tik0/talos/commit/8db906f0ca8498de963b0e3c787e58a721e9e395\r\n(Please notice that this commit is a forked branch, which comes with disabled stringification (#271), user defined history (#272) and fixed entropy (#268))\r\n\r\nThis is a major issue from my point of view and I will elaborate on a patch for a PR if desired.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/472403546","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/271#issuecomment-472403546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/271","id":472403546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjQwMzU0Ng==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T12:34:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T12:34:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is related with #272.\r\n\r\nThe whole logging side of things (results basically) is the next item on the list for a complete rebuild. At the moment it is hackish to say the least. I would like it to be as human readable as possible, that would be the main criteria. As the the whole thing really comes down to accurately logging results (and they way those results are used by reducers etc) in my view it's the single most critical aspect of Talos. All the other critical features feed on it. \r\n\r\nPart of this is unifying the various dataframe attributes in `scan_object` into a single dataframe with the results. Namely learning entropy, round times. \r\n\r\nWhen you mention storing models, do you know that model for every permutation is stored in `scan_object`. Regarding arrays, can you give an example of what such an array may contain.
