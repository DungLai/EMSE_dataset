You start with one dataset consisting of 50,000 samples/rows. You split it into half, and the first half (25,000 samples) you use as your train and validation data for the experiment. Once you have completed the experiment, you feed the other half (25,000 samples) into Evaluate. \r\n\r\nI would not use evaluate with the same data you have already used in the experiment, because now there is bias in the model towards that data. \r\n\r\nHere we are left with the question of why not also do cross-validation as part of the training process. This is something I've looked at, and it is not straightforward to do with tensors for each epoch. \r\n\r\nClosing here. Feel free to open new issue if anything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/495306876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2363182097,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM2MzE4MjA5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/2363182097","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-23T17:16:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/495307808","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/315#issuecomment-495307808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/315","id":495307808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTMwNzgwOA==","user":{"login":"tristndev","id":7668881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Njg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7668881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev","html_url":"https://github.com/tristndev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristndev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T17:18:54Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T17:18:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
