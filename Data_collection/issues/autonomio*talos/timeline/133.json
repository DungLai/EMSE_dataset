Talos every day for the past week or so. Working with lots of models which I run `predict()` on for validation. I am having an issue trying to find a way to predict without having to create a file. I've got a large core box running 24/7 creating lots of models. I would rather not create so many directories and zips for the models.   I forked and made a quick change to the `deploy()` command by pulling all the saving into another function and adding a flag to pass to init, also having it return an activate model when given the model specs just like restore does. \r\n\r\nI am wondering if I missed something in the documentation or in the code that will allow me to use the prediction on a keras model object without send the scan obejct to a file via csv or with deploy. \r\n\r\n - if there **is** a way point it out to me and I will update the documentation and put in a pull request\r\n - if there **isn't** a way and this is something that is applicable to contribute I will happily make my _first_
