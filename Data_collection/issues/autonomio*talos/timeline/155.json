I also really like to use talos, and I have the same list as input situation here.\r\n\r\nAnd my use-case is from here:\r\nhttp://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jdwittenauer/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/keras/StructuredTimeSeries.ipynb\r\n\r\nOverall, the idea is that you need to input each of the category features in your data to keras embedding layer to output the embedding matrix for each category feature. So for each category feature you need one input layer which will need a list of input array in keras. But besides this user-case, I think in RNN LSTM model, it also needs multiple inputs.\r\n\r\nI am still new and please correct me if anything wrong or there is better way to do this.

You can see some information in a related spectrum chat [here](https://spectrum.chat/?t=32b7113b-65e9-4140-8f70-c7a296283572). I've tried the following cases: \r\n\r\nFirst: \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nfrom keras.layers import Input, Dense, Dropout\r\nfrom keras.models import Model\r\n\r\nx = np.random.randn(100,10);\r\ny = np.random.randn(100,1);\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\nsys.path.insert(0, '/Users/mikko/Documents/GitHub/talos')\r\nimport talos as ta\r\n\r\np = {'dropout' : [0.1]}\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnd then first case where model.fit() input is list: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef input_model(x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val, params):\r\n\r\n    inputs = Input(shape=(x.shape[1],))\r\n    inputs_2 = Input(shape=(x.shape[1],))\r\n\r\n    layer = Dense(20)(inputs)\r\n    layer = Dropout(params['dropout'])(layer)\r\n    outputs = Dense(1)(layer)\r\n    model = Model([inputs, inputs_2], outputs)\r\n    model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')\r\n\r\n    history = model.fit(x=[x_train, x_train],\r\n                        y=y_train,\r\n                        validation_data=[[x_val, x_val], y_val],\r\n                        batch_size=10,\r\n                        epochs=2,\r\n                        verbose=1)\r\n    \r\n    return history, model\r\n\r\nta.Scan(x, y, p, input_model, x_val=x, y_val=y)\r\n```\r\nAnd second case where Scan() x is list:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef input_model(x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val, params):\r\n\r\n    inputs = Input(shape=(x.shape[1],))\r\n    inputs_2 = Input(shape=(x.shape[1],))\r\n\r\n    layer = Dense(20)(inputs)\r\n    layer = Dropout(params['dropout'])(layer)\r\n    outputs = Dense(1)(layer)\r\n    model = Model([inputs, inputs_2], outputs)\r\n    model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')\r\n\r\n    history = model.fit(x=x_train,\r\n                        y=y_train,\r\n                        validation_data=[x_val, y_val],\r\n                        batch_size=10,\r\n                        epochs=2,\r\n                        verbose=1)\r\n    \r\n    return history, model\r\n\r\nta.Scan([x, x], y, p, input_model, x_val=[x, x], y_val=y)\r\n```\r\nThe key point here is that you **must declare the `Scan(...x_val, y_val...) ` arguments as otherwise Talos will try to split the data and this will not work.

This is convenient for me since my model takes multiple inputs, let's call them `x_0, x_1`. I can access these numpy arrays as for instance `data['val']['x_0']` for my validation data of `x_0`, or `data['test']['y']` for my test data of targets. \r\n\r\nFurthermore (this shouldn't matter, but let me mention it, so that it is hopefully less confusing), inside the model creation function passed to Talos, I have defined another `dict` called `hp`, which collects all hyperparameters used by my Keras model. This is *not* used as the `params` of the Talos API. \r\n\r\nTo explain what I want to do, let me show a simplified example of what my standard (non-Talos) Keras script does:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Imports\r\nimport argparse\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport keras as ks\r\nimport talos as ta\r\n# and so on ...\r\n\r\nfrom my_functions import load_data, create_model, train\r\n\r\n# Load data\r\ndata = load_data('./my_data.h5')\r\n\r\n# Set hyperparameters\r\nhp = {'epochs'                     : 1000,\r\n      'batch_size'                 : 256,\r\n      'loss'                       : 'logcosh'}\r\n\r\n# Build model\r\nmodel = create_model(input_shapes=[data['train']['x_0'].shape[1:], data['train']['x_1'].shape[1:]], params=hp)\r\n\r\n# Train\r\nhistory, model = train(model=model, data=data, params=hp)https://lichess.org/Hsz1YtxYjdRM\r\n\r\n# Evaluate (predicting on test set and saving plots)\r\nevaluate(model=model, data=data, params=hp, dirs=dirs, verbose=verbose)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is how I've tried the integration with Talos:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Imports\r\nimport argparse\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport keras as ks\r\nimport talos as ta\r\n# and so on ...\r\n\r\nfrom my_functions import load_data, create_model, train\r\n\r\n# Load data\r\ndata = load_data('./my_data.h5')\r\n\r\nparams = {'batch_size'                 : [128, 256, 512],\r\n          'loss'                       : ['mae', 'logcosh']}\r\n\r\ndef talos_model(data, params):\r\n    # Set hyperparameters\r\n    hp = {'epochs'                     : 1000,\r\n          'batch_size'                 : params['batch_size'],\r\n          'loss'                       : params['loss']}\r\n\r\n    # Build model\r\n    model = create_model(input_shapes=[data['train']['x_0'].shape[1:], data['train']['x_1'].shape[1:]], params=hp)\r\n\r\n    # Train\r\n    history, model = train(model=model, data=data, params=hp)\r\n\r\n    # Evaluate (predicting on test set and saving plots)\r\n    evaluate(model=model, data=data, params=hp, dirs=dirs, verbose=verbose)\r\n\r\n    return history, model\r\n\r\nh = ta.Scan(x=[ data['train']['x_0'], data['train']['x_1'] ], # I'm unsure what to put here\r\n            y=data['train']['y'],\r\n            model=talos_model,\r\n            params=params)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the validation split seems to fail because the data is not structured as Talos expects it to. Here is the traceback:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nUsing TensorFlow backend.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"main.py\", line 102, in <module>\r\n    grid_downsample=0.1)\r\n  File \"/home/ffaye/miniconda3/envs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/talos/scan/Scan.py\", line 166, in __init__\r\n    self._null = self.runtime()\r\n  File \"/home/ffaye/miniconda3/envs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/talos/scan/Scan.py\", line 170, in runtime\r\n    self = scan_prepare(self)\r\n  File \"/home/ffaye/miniconda3/envs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/talos/scan/scan_prepare.py\", line 60, in scan_prepare\r\n    self = validation_split(self)\r\n  File \"/home/ffaye/miniconda3/envs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/talos/utils/validation_split.py\", line 18, in validation_split\r\n    random_shuffle(self)\r\n  File \"/home/ffaye/miniconda3/envs/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/talos/utils/validation_split.py\", line 42, in random_shuffle\r\n    self.x = self.x[random_index]\r\nTypeError: only integer scalar arrays can be converted to a scalar index\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Questions:** \r\n\r\n1. How can I input my data in a way that makes sense to Talos (preferably without rewriting all my functions)? What are the rules for what can be the arguments for `talos_model`?\r\n2. How can I specify that I would like to use my `[ data['val'][x_0], data['val'][x_1] ], data['val'][y]` as validation data, instead of Talos making the split from my training data?\r\n\r\n**Other remarks** (forgive me if these are known issues, or non-issues):\r\n1. In the [Talos user manual](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/blob/master/docs/index.rst), `reduction_metric` is not explained anywhere.\r\n2. If `grid_downsample` is too low a Python `IndexError` will be thrown. Maybe it would be better to have a Talos error message explaining what is happening?\r\n3. Thank you very much for writing this amazing piece of software! I really hope my issues can be resolved, so that I can start using it! :)\r\n\r\nEDIT: This may be addressed by https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/132#issuecomment-440675546, but the thread was a bit cluttered, and I'm not fully sure it applies to my scenario (or indeed if the mentioned local branch with the potential fix is available at the time of writing).
