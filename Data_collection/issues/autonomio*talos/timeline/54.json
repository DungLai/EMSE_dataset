In other words, maybe we don't care about anything other than the validation accuracy. Therefore, we can let the user easily not display the training loss, validation loss and training accuracy. There is a very easy way to do this with pandas that I've used before. Let me know if you have any trouble finding/using it and I can dig it up.\r\n- Easy callbacks of various histories. Perhaps there's a way to get Scan to save all those. This would be incredibly useful I think.\r\n- Can also trim the rows, so maybe only display the top 5 permutations. This is also easy to do in pandas I think.\r\n- Customizable display options (e.g. if user is running on terminal, let them set something to true/false so that instead of trying to display using pandas it just saves the .csv).\r\n\r\nCan't think of anything else off the top of my head but yeah that's a good place to start! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Otherwise when you're done I'll try to help comment/cleanup and whatnot. 👍

thanks a lot. In terms of the callbacks, could you share some examples for the use-cases. Generally storing the history is of course easy, and it seems that the data size should be totally ok as long as we handle it in an array the right way during, and dump to the df only in the end of the process. \r\n\r\nFor the displaying stuff I made the whole thing simpler in the way where you have a class object that takes in one parameter, which is the log, and then after that you have various properties (like peak round).
