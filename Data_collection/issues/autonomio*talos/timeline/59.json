idea for providing the datasets \"ready to go\" together with the corresponding params (and eventually corresponding models for each) is meant for two things: \r\n\r\n- for more robust testing (not feasible with travis) where we validate the results for major releases in a completely standard way \r\n\r\n- to give various examples (eventually covering as many typical prediction tasks as possible) so that its easy for the user to get going with Talos \r\n\r\nRegarding the datasets, there is also of course the case where its useful to have access to datasets that require no further prep before ingesting it into a model. Some common ones (like Iris) and some uncommon ones like (like icu_mortality).\r\n\r\nI'll try to get the Reporting pushed on Monday.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/414062652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/414308188","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/59#issuecomment-414308188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/59","id":414308188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDMwODE4OA==","user":{"login":"matthewcarbone","id":26401020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAxMDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26401020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewcarbone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewcarbone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-20T13:00:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-20T13:00:51Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Ah ok, so the point is just to ensure the datasets load in properly?
