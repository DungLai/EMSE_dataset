Finally, there will be several new reduction strategies building on the same principles as `correlation`. \r\n\r\nThe idea have been, and yesterday and today I have worked to make it actuality, that you can create drop-in strategies that take as input the 2d experiment log, and then apply some method to decide what should be done. The parameter space has several  accepted methods to manipulate the remaining space: \r\n\r\n- `remove_is_not(label, value)` # remove anything that does not match exactly\r\n- `remove_is(label, value)` # remove anything that exactly match\r\n- `remove_ge(label, value)` # remove anything that is greater or equal\r\n- `remove_le(label, value)` # remove anything that is less or equal\r\n- `remove_lambda(function)` # remove based on a lambda function \r\n\r\nThis means that as long as your strategy accepts 2d data as input, you are free to do whatever you want in between the input, and output using one of the above utilities to manipulate the parameter space. Moreover, there will handy utilities in `reducers/reduce_utils.py` to manipulate the experiment log into meaningful formats with single line commands, for example: \r\n\r\n`from .reduce_utils cols_to_multilabel`\r\n\r\n...will give access to `cols_to_multilabel` for converting the experiment log into multi_label (i.e. binary) columns, and provides a column format that contains the value, label and dtype in a way that is easy to pass as input to for example `remove_is`. \r\n\r\nI don't think this level of flexibility have been provided for the researcher in any similar tool in the past :)
