But your case is different and broader. \r\n\r\n**Regarding validation split**, (question 1) currently there is no option to input multiple arrays (which is the #132 case and the fix thereof). But that will deal with just the aspect of being able to pass a list of arrays, and might not resolve your case specifically. To say about that, I'd have to see first what is inside create_model(), train(), and evaluate() in your code. (question 2) The validation split itself you can handle through Scan() where you have the option for inputting x_val and y_val as argument. When you do that, there is no other splitting involved.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions. Once 0.4.5 gets to pypi which should happen in the next few days, I'll do a full pass on the manual to make sure it's 100% up-to-date. \r\n\r\n**So what is reduction_metric?** It's the metric (e.g. 'val_acc') the reduction is performed based on. For example, when the optimization algorithm is spearman rank order, the correlation is performed \"against\" reduction_metric.

There (it seems) you simply define a function that takes params from a set search space, and returns any real number (which could be the validation loss of some custom metric) that the minimizer then attempts to minimize by inputting different params. \r\nAside from the train_val_split functionality in Talos, what is the reason that the `Scan` method has to know anything about what the data (`x,y`) is? Is it integral to some core functionality of Talos? Is it for instance used when reducing the parameter space?\r\n\r\nPS. Please take the above both as (hopefully) constructive critique and as an expression of me wanting to understand how Talos works, and what it does fundamentally different from e.g. scikit-optimize.

would be great if possible to allow the option of using multi-output Keras models. \r\n\r\nIt is currently stated in Scan.py that y should have shape (m, c) where c is the number of classes. This restricts to one output parameter and inputting a multi-output model yields the following error:\r\n~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/talos/scan/scan_prepare.py in scan_prepare(self)\r\n     57 \r\n     58     # create the data asset\r\n---> 59     self.y_max = self.y.max()\r\n     60     self = validation_split(self)\r\n     61     self.shape = classify(self.y)\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'max'\r\n\r\nFor example the model I am currently working with outputs Age, Species, and Status where each has a different value of c in the shape (m, c).
