Maybe is not the perfect size, but with small dataset my model need data to train . Reasonably I think this is a quite god choice. When I try to evaluate with a different metric than 'val_acc' for example 'val_loss' as below\r\n```\r\ne.evaluate( X_test, y_test,\r\n                model_id=None,\r\n                folds=10,\r\n                shuffle=True,\r\n                metric='val_loss',\r\n                #mode = 'bynary',\r\n                asc=True) #set to true for loss\r\n                #print_out=False)    \r\n```\r\n\r\ni get :  59.81% (+/- 14.81%)\r\n\r\n1. why I get  a percentage?\r\n\r\n2. what (+/- 14.81%) means?\r\n\r\n3. if I try to specify mode or print_out I get :TypeError: evaluate() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mode', maybe because I haven't the last version of talos??? talos version: '0.4.3'\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/455848379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davide1993","id":19341977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzQxOTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19341977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993","html_url":"https://github.com/davide1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davide1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/455868516","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/178#issuecomment-455868516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/178","id":455868516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTg2ODUxNg==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-20T13:55:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-20T13:55:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1)

most talos code examples, X input seems to be a 2D numpy array.\r\nBut in some of my keras models, it requires a list of 2D numpy arrays because my models are not `Sequential`.\r\nExample list: `[numpyarray1, numpyarray2, numpyarray3]`.\r\n\r\nIt seems that when I try to pass this list to the `ta.Scan` function, things break.\r\n\r\nHow do I pass in a list of inputs?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not
