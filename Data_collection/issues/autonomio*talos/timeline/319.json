But I still don't know what does `shape` argument in the dictionary represent (`shapes` is a representation which would be used to calculate the number of neurons in each hidden layer accordingly, but `shape` hasn't been used anywhere), I am using `talos.__version__ = '0.4.9'`. However, in 0.6.0 there are changes in the arguments' names which would probably cause a lot of problems when one wants to use the newer version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/499861184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Peon26","id":24796970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Nzk2OTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24796970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26","html_url":"https://github.com/Peon26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peon26/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/500313335","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/319#issuecomment-500313335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/319","id":500313335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDMxMzMzNQ==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-10T06:59:32Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T06:59:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @Peon26, that's right.
