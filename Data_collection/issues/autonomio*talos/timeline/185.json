There was an issue with the example since some things have been streamlined since the notebook was made. I've just posted a fixed version [here](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/blob/daily-dev/examples/Hyperparameter%20Optimization%20with%20Keras%20for%20the%20Iris%20Prediction.ipynb). Note that it's only available in the daily-dev branch for now, but the link takes you to it directly. \r\n\r\nThanks again. Closing here. Feel free to open new issue/s in case anything.
