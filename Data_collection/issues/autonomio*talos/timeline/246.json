I think maybe I miss some details of how Talos work.\r\n\r\nTraining a deep learning model is expressed as \"epochs\" on one hand. The very simple version is that an epoch is an event when the entire dataset is passed through the neural net. Each epoch builds on the previous epoch, which explains why the first epoch tends to have weaker performance than the following ones. When this does not happen, there is usually something wrong with the model or data or parameters. In some cases the best performance takes place during early epochs, sometimes late epochs, and sometimes on the last epoch. When the last epoch performs the best, it usually means there is still room to improve performance. You can think of it like someone gives you a paper to read with 5 pages. You're going to read that paper 10 times to really make it clear for yourself. As you read it again and again, you keep building on your previous learning. Each of those times is an epoch. \r\n\r\nSo if you have  ta.Scan(... `last_epoch_value=True` ...) then you will see in Talos results the result of the last epoch. If you have ta.Scan(... `last_epoch_value=False` ...) then you will see the peak epoch, which could have been very early in the training process, and in later epochs the result might have become worse. The model might have started to over-train etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/468615378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/468922869","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/246#issuecomment-468922869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/246","id":468922869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODkyMjg2OQ==","user":{"login":"17laker","id":40563079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTYzMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40563079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker","html_url":"https://github.com/17laker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/17laker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-02T13:56:39Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T13:57:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for the late reply.

Talos does not take away anything or add anything to your Keras model. So if you are able to reproduce results with Keras model, then you are able to reproduce results with Talos.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take things offline or to another system, then the only way you can do it is using `ta.Deploy()` which gives you full access to models from every permutation . Basically `ta.Restore()` gives you a replica of the `ta.Scan()` object with some minor constraints. You can explore this easily yourself by looking at the namespaces/attributes for `ta.Scan()` and `ta.Restore()` objects. Talos namespaces are 100% clean i.e. there is nothing extra in the namespace so anything you see there is worth checking out to understand what is possible. \r\n\r\nOnce you do that, you will also learn about options you have with `ta.Scan()` object, which seems to be your other question. You can also check `ta.Evaluate()` and `ta.Predict()`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/469011272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/469011831","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/246#issuecomment-469011831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/246","id":469011831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTAxMTgzMQ==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-03T11:03:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-03T11:03:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Sometimes I want to know not only the metric like val_loss but also the predicted value to make a comparison with the actual values. I think it's pretty important or what we got from Scan results is meaningless and unreliable.\r\n\r\nIf you are unclear with basic functionality of Talos, you will find the [README](https://github.com/autonomio/talos), [EXAMPLES](https://github.com/autonomio/talos#examples), and [DOCS](https://autonomio.github.io/docs_talos/#introduction) useful. Improvement suggestions to that end are most welcome. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/469011831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
