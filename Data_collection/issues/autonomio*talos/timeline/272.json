Whether or not `last_epoch_value` is `True` or `False`, the peak epochs will be evaluated. This causes definitely errors for user-defined history objects. Making the peak epoch evaluation depending on `last_epoch_value`, which is absolutely plausible if the user only demands that behavior, fixes the issue.

[x] I'm up-to-date with the latest release (i.e. v.0.4.9 and all upcoming possibly):\r\n- [x] I've confirmed that my Keras model works outside of Talos.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI found a crucial issue in the result logging (**i.e. `results.py` for all current an upcoming versions**). All results, as well as the headers are stored in a single list, which is the member object `self.result`, or temporary variable `_rr_out` respectively. However, to store the values, the dictionary keys are traversed and concatenated into the list. **And here comes the issue**: Python does not guarantee the order of keys in a dictionary! Therefore, it is possible that values like `acc` may become `acc_val`, or the `loss` value becomes a parameter, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt might be the case that this issue hardly happens for only a few metrics and parameters. But it definitely happens in my exhaustive evaluations with dozens of metrics and parameters.\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue can be very easily fixed by using a dictionary instead of a list for storing the results. I already implemented this feature in my fork: https://github.com/tik0/talos/commit/8db906f0ca8498de963b0e3c787e58a721e9e395\r\n(Please notice that this commit is a forked branch, which comes with disabled stringification (#271), user defined history (#272) and fixed entropy (#268))\r\n\r\nThis is a major issue from my point of view and I will elaborate on a patch for a PR if
