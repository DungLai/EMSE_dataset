I think, because of the way Talos works, that one should be able to run TensorFlow codes together with a tf.keras model inside `input_model` for `Scan()`. In facf, one should be able to run any arbitrary codes as long as the model otherwise follows the Talos way (e.g. keras style history object). \r\n\r\nClosing here.
