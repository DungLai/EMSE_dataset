I believe I am misunderstanding how talos treats parameters. \r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n> You don't have to pass params['something'] as argument to every parameter in a Keras model. You can just pass something instead.\r\n\r\nI should clarify that I need to pass this parameter dynamically as this will change depending on the dataset I am using, and I do not want to hardcode this array in the main model itself, but pass it as a (static) array which does _not_ get optimised. But because the talos syntax looks as so (in my case):\r\n\r\n```\r\nt = ta.Scan(vstack([X_train,X_test]), \r\n            asarray(y_train+y_test).reshape(-1, 1), \r\n            model=char_cnn_model_talos,\r\n            disable_progress_bar=True,\r\n            params=opt_params, \r\n            val_split=.1)\r\n```\r\nthe only parameters I can pass to my model, because of talos, is the dictionary `opt_params`. Consequently my `something` needs to be a value with a key in the `opt_params` dictionary. This bring us to your second point:\r\n\r\n> Or if you want to have it visible in your Talos experiment results, then just have a single value for that parameter in your params dictionary. In your case that would be {... class_weight: [someweight] ...}.\r\n\r\nThis would indeed be good but if I have a multiclass or binary-class classification problem then the class-weight array will be an array an not a single number. And then, I believe, talos will explicitly try to find the optimal value (for these values) w.r.t. to the objective. This is what I am trying to avoid. I simply want to pass that array without talos \"finding out\" about it as it were. Here is an example of my parameter dict which at present does not work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopt_params ={\r\n             'optimizer': ['adam'],\r\n             'loss': ['binary_crossentropy'],\r\n             'conv_activation':['elu'],\r\n             'dense_activation':['elu'],\r\n             'last_activation': ['sigmoid'],\r\n             # Stationary parameters, i.e. do not get optimised\r\n             'class_weight': {0:0.5, 1:1.2}\r\n             'max_sentence_length':[max_sentence_length]\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/talos/scan/scan_run.py in scan_run(self)\r\n      7 \r\n      8     from .scan_prepare import scan_prepare\r\n----> 9     self =
