Regarding 1, this is now handled in two ways (and will be available in 0.4.6) where you have several new related attributes in the Scan object, and also there is a new command Autom8() that takes you from start of Scan() all the way to predictions and best model. \r\n\r\nI appreciate the fact that the hidden_layers approach could be more intuitive, I will create a new issue for this for discussion. This is in #157. \r\n\r\nFor 3, thanks for referencing it. This is a rather low priority item at this point, but probably we'll get to it later. \r\n\r\nThis is clearly a must-have, as you suggested, the user is now totally in the dark. Creating a new issue.

thanks for your answers on #144. \r\n\r\nAbout the first question, I am currently trying to add the result from the evaluation into the csv file. This is because I believe it will be a better way to select the best models when using Predict(). Right now I just open and write the .csv file in my scripts after the scan ... not always feasible ...\r\n\r\nYou mentioned new available tools in your answer, is there any doc about them and what version to use ? \r\n\r\nAlso, I have access to a computing network (handled with slurm) and I wanted to split the trainings between different nodes (CPU, of course slower than a GPU but since there is only one of the latter and hundreds or the former ... parallel wins over serial). SO basically I just split the experiment dict into smaller ones and distribute them over the different nodes. And in the end I concatenate the csv for analysis. \r\n\r\nBut this poses a problem when appending the csv file due to the file stageout.
