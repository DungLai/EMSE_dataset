I understand your concern and indeed there is a case for agreeing mutually to something. Thank you also for sharing about your package.\r\n\r\nAt the moment there are [346](https://github.com/search?q=talos) repositories that come up with the keyword Talos. [Many](https://www.google.com/search?q=talos&oq=talos&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j0.3456j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Talos are also coming up in Google search. Because of the meaning of the word, I assume many have to do with machine intelligence, and many more will come in the future. That is an unfortunate downside of the ease in which new projects can be initiated these days.\r\n\r\nI think the problem would lie in the case where two packages had become popular, and were doing a similar thing. This would indeed confuse users, and make things like [asking questions on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=talos) difficult.\r\n\r\nOne important distinction here is that Talos has many active users across disciplines of scientific research and we know as a fact that tens of thousands of people have come across it. Every week several thousand people come to the repo. It would therefore be difficult for me to agree to do anything that would potentially become a source of confusion for all those people.
