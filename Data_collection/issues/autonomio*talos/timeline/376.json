However, most other things in the example are also broken. `ta.Scan` does not work (the downsampling feature is broken as in issue #299). Changing to the daily-dev (and changing the names of input arguments) fixes issue #299 but leaves more things broken. Commands like `r.high()` do not function with the latest version (it now requires inputs), and none of the plotting functions will display (which may be an astetik failure in colab). The evaluate section includes the `average='macro'` argument which does not exist in the daily-dev version.\r\n\r\nEDIT: the plotting functions work if you enter these commands at the beginning: \r\n```\r\nimport seaborn as sns\r\nsns.set()\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/521415664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jojker","id":14794131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Nzk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14794131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker","html_url":"https://github.com/jojker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/521538469","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/376#issuecomment-521538469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/376","id":521538469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTUzODQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T07:01:11Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T07:01:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For now, my recommendation is to use a >=0.6.2 version and refer to the examples in the [docs](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/).
