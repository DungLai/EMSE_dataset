If that feature does not exist, it would be really awesome.  The scenario I have is an experiment has been running for a few days and made it about 25% in.  Unfortunately it interrupted by something that was my fault and I am wishing I could pick up where it left off.  \r\n\r\nI am running the version pulled from the GitHub link and using the experimental feature to use specific train and validation sets.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/97/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/97/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/515776787","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/207#issuecomment-515776787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/207","id":515776787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTc3Njc4Nw==","user":{"login":"renatobellotti","id":10884299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODg0Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10884299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti","html_url":"https://github.com/renatobellotti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatobellotti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-28T16:37:52Z","updated_at":"2019-07-28T16:37:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to make a suggestion for this.

Update \r\n\r\nFrom 0.6.3 onwards, there is available `Scan(...reduction_method='gamify')` which outputs to the experiment folder with the experiment id a .json file during each permutation. In that file there is a dictionary with dictionaries, where the main dictionary keys consist of hyperparameter labels, and the sub-dictionaries consist of hyperparameter values corresponding to the label (e.g. lr and 0.01). Together with the value there is a string 'active' by default. Changing this to 'inactive' in the local file, during the next permutation all permutations in the parameter space with that value will be dropped. \r\n\r\nRelated with this, as of yesterday a visual command center (well for now it's just the visuals, but commands are coming). It's called [Gamify](https://github.com/autonomio/gamify) and it allows you to visualize and analyze the experiment results during the experiment through a web browser. \r\n\r\n<img src='https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e0088abbc7c1f98ab5b898d38b90d43657a973bd/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f3838534b5753672f6f766572766965772e706e67'>\r\n\r\nWith the Talos v.0.6.3 changes, also controls will be added to Gamify, so that you can analyze the results, make changes, and see the changes for yourself in real-time.
