Use Eager execution or decorate this function with @tf.function.\r\n\r\n#### 4) Explain what actually happened\r\n\r\nThis file works OK in Tensorflow 1.15 conda environment\r\n\r\n#### 5) Provide a code-complete reference\r\n See attached example notebook with error traceback included.\r\n[Hyperparameter Optimization on Keras with Breast Cancer Data.zip](https://github.com/autonomio/talos/files/3992179/Hyperparameter.Optimization.on.Keras.with.Breast.Cancer.Data.zip)\r\n\r\n- [ ] My bug report includes an input model\r\n- [x] My bug report includes a parameter dictionary\r\n- [x] My bug report includes a `Scan()` command\r\n- [ ] My bug report question includes a link to a sample of the data\r\n\r\nNOTE: If the data is sensitive and can't be shared, [create dummy data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#samples-generator) that mimics it.\r\n\r\n**A self-contained Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or similar is highly preferred and will speed up helping you with your issue.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/443/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2979842670,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI5Nzk4NDI2NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/events/2979842670","actor":{"login":"mikkokotila","id":7943188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7943188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkokotila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkokotila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-26T11:08:45Z","label":{"name":"announcement","color":"d3d3d3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/comments/578504647","html_url":"https://github.com/autonomio/talos/issues/451#issuecomment-578504647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/autonomio/talos/issues/451","id":578504647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODUwNDY0Nw==","user":{"login":"srujansai1997","id":60318378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzE4Mzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60318378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997","html_url":"https://github.com/srujansai1997","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srujansai1997/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-26T14:01:15Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T14:10:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am unable to install talos@1.0 from the above command.
