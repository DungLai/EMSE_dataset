I import `from talos.metrics.keras_metrics import fbeta_score` and compile the model with this metric, then run talos with the parameter `reduction_metric=\"fbeta_score\"` the output csv seems to list the the val_acc of the best epoch for val_acc, but only the first epoch's value for fbeta_score. This seems like something is going wrong, as if anything it should be producing the corresponding fbeta_score for that epoch I would have though.  \r\n\r\nI am not interested  in accuracy due to class imbalance in my system, and the accuracy saturates after a few epochs, so I need to talos to store for each parameter combination either:\r\n\r\na) The result of the last epoch \r\nb) Ideally the result with the best fbeta_score \r\n\r\nGiven that fbeta_score has been implemented, I assume this must be possible but I don't see how. \r\n\r\nI am using the latest dev branch  v0.2 (as I have augmented data, I needed the functionality to supply x_val and y_val as parameters). In order to run this code without bugs, I needed to change;\r\n`talos/metrics/score_model.py` line 17 \r\nfrom `y_pred = self.keras_model.predict_classes(self.x_val)`\r\nto ` y_pred = self.keras_model.predict(self.x_val)` \r\n\r\nWhich might be related to my problem.
