For a variable like age, if you have a lot of data, you could [one-hot encode](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) age. In the case that you do not have a lot of data, you can bin age (for example, 0-10, 11-20, 20-30, etc.) and then create a binary column for each bin. It's then just a matter of appending your binary label columns with the encoded binary columns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/comments/646868889/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trent-b","id":34728837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34728837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3470625667,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ3MDYyNTY2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/events/3470625667","actor":{"login":"trent-b","id":34728837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34728837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-23T00:26:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
