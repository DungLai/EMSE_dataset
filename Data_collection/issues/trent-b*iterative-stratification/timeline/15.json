I do not think I ever tested with train_size set to a value other than None. As a workaround, you could do the following:\r\n```\r\n_, test_idx = mlb_train_test_split(labels, test_size=1200, train_size=None, random_state=0)\r\nsubset_labels = labels[test_idx].copy()\r\ntrain_idx, test_idx = mlb_train_test_split(subset_labels, test_size=1000, train_size=None, random_state=1)\r\nprint('Num train labels:', len(subset_labels[train_idx]), '; proportions:', np.mean(subset_labels[train_idx], axis=0))\r\nprint('Num test labels:', len(subset_labels[test_idx]), '; proportions:', np.mean(subset_labels[test_idx], axis=0))","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/comments/812149829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trent-b","id":34728837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34728837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
