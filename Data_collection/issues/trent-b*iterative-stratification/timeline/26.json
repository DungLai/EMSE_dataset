I wonder though if you could maybe [one-hot encode](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html#sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder) your targets, feed them into the stratifier, keep track of the indices of the instances, and then, once they are split into folds, convert them back into the original target values since you've retained the indices. Just a thought. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/comments/1333022322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trent-b","id":34728837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34728837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/comments/1350797133","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/26#issuecomment-1350797133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/26","id":1350797133,"node_id":"IC_kwDOByk6jc5Qg4dN","user":{"login":"bablf","id":57184353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTg0MzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57184353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf","html_url":"https://github.com/bablf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bablf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-14T10:16:29Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T10:16:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
