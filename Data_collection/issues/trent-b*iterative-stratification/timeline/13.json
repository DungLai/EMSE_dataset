Could you share a use case where it would be useful to set custom fold proportions (pass a custom `r`)? I am not opposed to the idea as long as there is a use case for it. If you would like, you could submit a Pull Request with the suggested change along with some test code that I could review and merge.

The use-case is that we want to distribute a part of the dataset across a fold subset (n-1 folds in our case), and then distribute the rest of the dataset across all folds - setting ``r`` on the second step allows to get folds of equal sizes. The reason why we want to do that is rather specific, that's why is could be quite a marginal use-case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/comments/720349431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lopuhin","id":424613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin","html_url":"https://github.com/lopuhin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lopuhin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/comments/1199789536","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/13#issuecomment-1199789536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/13","id":1199789536,"node_id":"IC_kwDOByk6jc5Hg1Xg","user":{"login":"trent-b","id":34728837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34728837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T17:36:12Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T17:36:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing
