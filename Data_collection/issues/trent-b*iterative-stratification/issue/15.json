I have a large json data set that i want to use MultilabelStratifiedShuffleSplit to create a smaller sample set. \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef mlb_train_test_split(labels, test_size, train_size, random_state=0):\r\n    with warnings.catch_warnings():\r\n        warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\r\n        msss = MultilabelStratifiedShuffleSplit(\r\n            test_size=test_size, train_size=train_size, random_state=random_state\r\n        )\r\n    train_idx, test_idx = next(msss.split(np.ones_like(labels), labels))\r\n    return train_idx, test_idx\r\n```\r\n\r\ni then call the function as :\r\n\r\n`train_idx, test_idx = mlb_train_test_split(labels, test_size=1000 train_size=200, random_state=0)`\r\n    \r\nWhen i look at the numbers I'm seeing way more than 200 rows. Is there a limitation? The labels length is approximately 500,000 in the dataset.
