Using `iterative_train_test_split` from skmultilearn library (```\r\nfrom skmultilearn.model_selection import iterative_train_test_split\r\nx_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = iterative_train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 0.1)\r\n```) would turned out an error, it seems to be working only multi-label data (binary class, multi-output). So is it possible for this iterative-stratification module could make to support for multi-target dataset.\r\nThank you.","closed_by":{"login":"trent-b","id":34728837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34728837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
