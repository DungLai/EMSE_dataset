Again, this number can be calculated with some simple combinatorics.\r\n\r\nHowever, when stratification on multiple labels is enforced (the goal of this repo), things become more complicated and I am worried that if there are too much labels, say hundreds of them, there won't be too many possible splits that can satisfy the stratification constraintðŸ˜Ÿ.\r\n\r\nSo my question is,\r\n\r\n- Does my concern make sense?\r\n- Can we calculate the total number of possibilities?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reply.","closed_by":{"login":"trent-b","id":34728837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI4ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34728837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b","html_url":"https://github.com/trent-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trent-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trent-b/iterative-stratification/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
