I am not a python expert but looking at your group_by_prefix function in splitfolders/split.py on line 190 it is checking to see if the file name startswith instead of checking for an exact match on the file name before the file extension. So for image_130.png, the function is going to find a match for image_130.png, image_1300,png, image_1301.png etc. ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jfilter/split-folders/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jfilter/split-folders/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
