Something like (x.jpg, test/x.jpg)? What is your use case for the paths? When do you need the file paths instead of moving/copying the files?\r\n\r\nExactly! \r\nthe reason is two things:\r\n1.  I often have a whole lot of files - sometimes above 500GB. copying takes up too much space\r\n2. I want to keep the original pile of annotation in the original structure to be able to keep track of my data version, and what happens to the data since it was added (via Weights and Biases)\r\n\r\nI therefore often just need a list of the split file pairs and can add it by filename. \r\nI still from time to time want to physically split or copy files and folders, therefore I though it could make sense to be able to get the lists of filenames in the different splits as outputs
