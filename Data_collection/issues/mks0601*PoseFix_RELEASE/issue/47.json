I guess it is due to the heavy-CPU pose synthesis code, as shown below\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2276264/104746225-482eed80-574f-11eb-9871-cac1c823ac52.png)\r\n\r\nAccording to my estimation, one COCO epoch is 9364 iterations. It takes 6 minutes to finish 30 iterations. This means 1 epoch will require 9364/30 * 6  = 1872.8 minutes = 31.2133333333 hours. That means it would take you around 150 days to finish 140 epochs right?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2276264/104746623-d4411500-574f-11eb-9847-d02354695219.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mks0601","id":13601723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAxNzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13601723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601","html_url":"https://github.com/mks0601","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/47/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
