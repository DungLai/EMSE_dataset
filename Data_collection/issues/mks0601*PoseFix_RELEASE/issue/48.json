Input images are subjected from the pixel_means, while the heatmap value ranges are in  [0, 255].\r\n\r\nCould you please describe a bit more about this kind of normalization? Or Did I miss something from your code?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
