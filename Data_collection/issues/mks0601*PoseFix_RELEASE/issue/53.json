Also, made the changes in `data/COCO/dataset.py` regarding `input_pose_path` and `main/config.py` about `testset` and `dataset` as you explained at [this issue](https://github.com/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/21).\r\n\r\nThe tensorflow version is not stated in `requirements.txt`, therefore I tried with tf 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11.
