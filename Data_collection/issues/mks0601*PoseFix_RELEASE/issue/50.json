This means that this kind of heat map cannot be used as a confidence score, I am right?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2276264/106159603-46b8e880-6185-11eb-964a-dcf74cb3899b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here is the heatmap I used for visualization.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2276264/106157876-6fd87980-6183-11eb-8f92-c0c3290a86a6.png)\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n\r\n- **Am I right that the integral heatmaps can not be used as confidence scores.**\r\n\r\n- **If it's not, is there any way I can achieve confidence scores from an approach like PoseFix?**\r\n\r\nThanks and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\nBest \r\nKhanh","closed_by":{"login":"khanhha","id":2276264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzYyNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2276264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha","html_url":"https://github.com/khanhha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
