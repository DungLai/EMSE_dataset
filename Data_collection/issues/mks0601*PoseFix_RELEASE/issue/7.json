We tested them by ourselves without ensembling and testing time augmentation.\r\n\r\nDid you mean using single input for all the related approaches (PAFs [5], AE [20], Mask R-CNN [11], CPN [7], and Simple [30])?  I'm not clear. Which procedure is yours in the paper:\r\n\r\n1. Only single input to the model\r\n2. Multi input to the model (probably with flip augmentation)\r\n3. Multi input and flip augmentation but without model ensemble \r\n\r\nBecause for bottom-up approaches, they must use multi-scale input images to cover the variant   scales of poses. And for other top-down approaches, they usually use flip augmentation to improve precision. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your help.
