I mean the scale value between two kinds of input: input image and input keypoint heatmaps; Image has a value range of [-126, 126], and input heatmap has a value of a range of [0, 255]. They are concatenated into a multi-channel input before passing into convolution operations, so I suppose that they should be normalized to the same scale.\r\n\r\nAnyway, your normalization technique produces accurate results, so that means it works. Maybe it's just a matter of training convergence.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/comments/761139849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"khanhha","id":2276264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzYyNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2276264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha","html_url":"https://github.com/khanhha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanhha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/comments/761269240","html_url":"https://github.com/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/48#issuecomment-761269240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/48","id":761269240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTI2OTI0MA==","user":{"login":"mks0601","id":13601723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAxNzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13601723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601","html_url":"https://github.com/mks0601","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-16T00:14:31Z","updated_at":"2021-01-16T00:14:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Although they are concatenated, their scales do not have to be in the same range.
