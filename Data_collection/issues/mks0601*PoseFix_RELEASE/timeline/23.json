I have tested that **oks_nms** has no hurt the accuracy of PoseFix, and I will test your original results with your methods. It may be that the results I have generated by other method are saturated, and it is difficult for PoseFix to further improve it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/comments/528411140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HeathHose","id":14328405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzI4NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14328405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose","html_url":"https://github.com/HeathHose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeathHose/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3135573783,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzEzNTU3Mzc4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mks0601/PoseFix_RELEASE/issues/events/3135573783","actor":{"login":"mks0601","id":13601723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAxNzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13601723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601","html_url":"https://github.com/mks0601","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mks0601/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-17T02:22:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
