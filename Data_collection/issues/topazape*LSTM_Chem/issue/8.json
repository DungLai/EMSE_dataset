Unfortunately I don't have the luxury to get a GPU because of 2 reasons: \r\n1) The labs in our departments are closed due to quarentine for another 1.5 months\r\n2) I don't have a pre - existing GPU to run CUDA .\r\n\r\nIf you could make your transfer learning model public ( Ie the trained model created from model.save() ) It would be a great help. I could then alter your code and use transfer learning for my usecase. \r\n\r\n1 solution I found was to use 100K data points to train the initial network ( LSTM Cell + RNN ) , however that is also quiet time consuming surprisingly on the CPU + the results will suffer. \r\n\r\nAwaiting your reply\r\nYour's Sincerely","closed_by":{"login":"ashishgupta1350","id":24922775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTIyNzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24922775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350","html_url":"https://github.com/ashishgupta1350","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishgupta1350/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
