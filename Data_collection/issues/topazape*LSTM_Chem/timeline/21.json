It seems that self.max_len would always be 0 when data_type is set as 'finetune'. This causes no 'A' padding to raw SMILES. As a result, each numpy.arrary(X) (line105 in data_loader.py) differs in axis 0 and could not be concatenated. \r\nI believe that SMILES in finetune should also be padded to the max length.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/comments/1153700016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sooooooap","id":37863605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODYzNjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37863605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap","html_url":"https://github.com/Sooooooap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sooooooap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6794574540,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB8Rc2849ROwYzwAAAAGU_PrM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/events/6794574540","actor":{"login":"phquanta","id":22856855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODU2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22856855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta","html_url":"https://github.com/phquanta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-13T09:39:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6794574546,"node_id":"SE_lADOB8Rc2849ROwYzwAAAAGU_PrS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/events/6794574546","actor":{"login":"phquanta","id":22856855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODU2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22856855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta","html_url":"https://github.com/phquanta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phquanta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-13T09:39:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
