@Laser-Cho,\r\n\r\nSorry for the late reply.\r\n\r\nYou are right, I am aware that the number of molecules used in the paper does not match the number of molecules that can be obtained in the SQL query described in the README.md.\r\nHowever, I don't know the correct SQL query because the paper doesn't give that.\r\nIf you have any good ideas, please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/comments/652158696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"topazape","id":38512143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTEyMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38512143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape","html_url":"https://github.com/topazape","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3500441741,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUwMDQ0MTc0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/events/3500441741","actor":{"login":"Laser-Cho","id":45229691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjI5Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45229691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho","html_url":"https://github.com/Laser-Cho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T03:01:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3500441743,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MDA0NDE3NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/events/3500441743","actor":{"login":"Laser-Cho","id":45229691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjI5Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45229691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho","html_url":"https://github.com/Laser-Cho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laser-Cho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T03:01:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
