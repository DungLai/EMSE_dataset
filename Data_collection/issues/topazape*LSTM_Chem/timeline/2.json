(In this context, your SMILES set named `your-favorite-smiles.smi`.)\r\nAnd edit line like: `\"finetune_data_filename\": \"./datasets/your-favorite-smiles.smi\"`, in `./configs/LSTMChem_config.json`.\r\nFinally, run `finetune.py`, you get newly generated SMILES in `WantsChems.smi`.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have relevant SMILES set for fine-tune, please get wet data in your organization.\r\nOr, please remake `./datasets/datasets.smi`, because train dataset chemicals in `datasets.smi` were extracted from **whole** ChEMBL DataBase on condition that chemical shows IC50, EC50, Ki < nM.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to generate new kinase inhibitor, care must be taken you may avoid kinase inhibitor when you extract from ChEMBL DataBase. And make extracted SMILES set to train dataset and make avoided kinase inhibitor SMILES set for test set (fine-tune set).\r\nPerhaps, you may not need this steps. Train NN `./datasets/datasets.smi` of this repo and fin-tune kinase inhibitor SMILES that is extracted from ChEMBL DB. \r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with handling ChEMBL DB, [this article](http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2017/03/24/chembl_bioactivity_data.html) is
