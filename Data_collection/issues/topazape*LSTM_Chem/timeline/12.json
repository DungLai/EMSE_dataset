For example, if you want to get new 100 molecules grew from benzamidine `c1c(C(=N)N)cccc1`, call `lstm_chem.generator.sample(num=100, start='Gc1c(C(=N)N)cccc1')`.\r\n\r\nHowever, be careful, this benzamidine SMILES sequence is not canonical. The SMILES is changed to elongate the molecule in a specific direction. That is, `N=C(N)c1ccccc1` is canonical. `N=C(N)c1ccccc1CCC` is valid, but that is wrong direction. So I changed SMILES to valid and correct direction. (e.g. `c1c(C(=N)N)cccc1CCC`)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/comments/701108592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"topazape","id":38512143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTEyMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38512143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape","html_url":"https://github.com/topazape","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topazape/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3822306603,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgyMjMwNjYwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/events/3822306603","actor":{"login":"shree970","id":41207097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjA3MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41207097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970","html_url":"https://github.com/shree970","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-30T01:40:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3822306604,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MjIzMDY2MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/topazape/LSTM_Chem/issues/events/3822306604","actor":{"login":"shree970","id":41207097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjA3MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41207097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970","html_url":"https://github.com/shree970","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shree970/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-30T01:40:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
