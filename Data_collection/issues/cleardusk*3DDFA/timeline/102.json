The Dlib face detector is outdated for a long time. I have recommended some accurate and fast face detectors: FaceBoxes.PyTorch, libfacedetection, ZQCNN, described in readme.md. You can use them to substitute Dlib and welcome to propose a PR.\r\n2. Multi-GPU inference is easy, you can refer to the DataParallel function in Pytorch.\r\n4. I have updated a demo recently, you can dig into the demo code for more details.\r\n\r\nYour questions are a little messy, but welcome for your interest in this repo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/comments/539915949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cleardusk","id":7555251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7555251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2832826356,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgzMjgyNjM1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/events/2832826356","actor":{"login":"cleardusk","id":7555251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7555251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-26T17:29:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
