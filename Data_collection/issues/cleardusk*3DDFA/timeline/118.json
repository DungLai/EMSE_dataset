I am far from being a reliable source of information here, but here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\n- If you delete the `w_shp @ alpha_shp` term, you will still be able to generate the dense vertices. However, your resulting mesh will only have the information coming from the FaceWarehouse correlation. Most likely, all the face you generate will have pretty much the same geometry.\r\n\r\n- In order to replace the BFM dependency, you will a new dataset that correlates the geometry of the faces to the params generated by your algorithm. Once you have that, you can do PCA on that new geometry and come up with a new `alpha_shp` tensor. \r\n\r\n- I think that there is still some dependency to BFM in the `u` variable (base mesh) from the vertex equation, correct? If that is the case you will need to also replace that.\r\n\r\n- Do you know if it would be possible to use the 300W dataset to do the steps described above?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/comments/621033168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fleskovar","id":6884660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODQ2NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6884660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar","html_url":"https://github.com/fleskovar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fleskovar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3283311378,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI4MzMxMTM3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/events/3283311378","actor":{"login":"cleardusk","id":7555251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7555251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-29T07:22:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3283311383,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyODMzMTEzODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/events/3283311383","actor":{"login":"cleardusk","id":7555251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7555251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-29T07:22:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/comments/622461693","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/118#issuecomment-622461693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/118","id":622461693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjQ2MTY5Mw==","user":{"login":"cleardusk","id":7555251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7555251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-01T16:36:05Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T16:36:05Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@fleskovar
