@xiaoxingzeng I noticed that both s4 and s5 are calculated in evaluate/benchmark_aflw.py and evaluate/benchmark_aflw2000.py. s4 is commented out and s5 is reported. However, the overall NME should be s4. \r\n\r\nI checked the consistency of AFLW_GT_pts68.npy and AFLW_GT_pts21.npy.  I got the pseudo 21 landmarks from AFLW_GT_pts68.npy by `ind_68to21` and calculated the euclidian distance between pseudo 21 landmarks and GT 21 landmarks. After filtering out the invalid landmarks, the average distance is 10.21. \r\n\r\nI also observed the test error on AFLW is much larger. As the network is supervised by 68 landmarks in 300w-LP, it probably also learn to approach  AFLW_GT_pts68.npy instead of AFLW_GT_pts21.npy. If so, can this explain the large test error on AFLW?
