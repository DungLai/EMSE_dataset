In https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA/blob/e44cd27fbef0feb71cc770bf05a1961bca13c423/utils/ddfa.py#L54-L56\r\nyou use `vertex[1, :] = std_size + 1 - vertex[1, :]` to do the transform, while I think it should be `vertex[1, :] = std_size - 1 - vertex[1, :]`.\r\nTake a simple image with 4 pixels with both width and height equals to 2. It seems the new Y-axis coordinate should be `1 - original_y_axis_coord`.\r\nAm I making a mistake here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/comments/738054442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FunkyKoki","id":36239710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjM5NzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36239710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki","html_url":"https://github.com/FunkyKoki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
