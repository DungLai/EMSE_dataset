Is this a bug? Or is there any special reason to remove the negative sign? If so, can you explain why the sign is removed? Thanks!\r\n\r\nAs I can see from the code, the pose is not used at anywhere. So the bug has no influence.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/comments/738621611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FunkyKoki","id":36239710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjM5NzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36239710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki","html_url":"https://github.com/FunkyKoki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FunkyKoki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
