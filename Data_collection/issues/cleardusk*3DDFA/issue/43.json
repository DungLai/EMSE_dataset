I am kind of new to this topic. But I couldn't grasp how you are generating the fist two styles. Are they depth map and PNCC represented in different color ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cleardusk","id":7555251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7555251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
