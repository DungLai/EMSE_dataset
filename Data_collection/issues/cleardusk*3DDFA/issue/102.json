I found that the inference of the train data(train_aug_120x120.zip) often fails because of the failure of face detection and cropping. For example, I have run main.py for train_aug_120x120, only 22300/52752 faces can be detected to generate obj, depth, ...etc.\r\nIs there any advice for me to make the face detection more accurate?\r\n\r\nA:\r\nOh, I find that the comment in your code 'two-step for more accurate bbox to crop face' maybe works and improves the possibility of detecting and cropping faces? \r\nAlso found some suggestions on https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/96  Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\n2. Is there a way to use multi-GPU for the inference process? (main.py)\r\n\r\n3. Is there a way to modify the accuracy of the obj（3D models）？I mean, can I just modify some parameters in your code to improve the accuracy. We can see the obj from Blender2.80 that its accuracy is not so satisfactory especially for the 'nose' but maybe it is because the RGB images are too rough.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42494274/66381415-d9ab9d80-e9eb-11e9-9563-ecde09c56cad.png)\r\n\r\nA: \r\nFound instructions on (https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/48), I need to refer to papers for high-fidelity face reconstruction, haha.\r\n\r\n4. tri = sio.loadmat('visualize/tri.mat')['tri']  Is the tri.mat(3D mesh triangle indices) still available for all color image in the dataset you provided?\r\n\r\nA:\r\nFound instructions on (https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/66) Use tri.mat, not tri_refine.mat. The previous can be applied to any image or video.\r\n\r\n5. write_obj_with_colors, does the 'colors' mean the texture? \r\n\r\nA:\r\nFound instructions on (https://github.com/YadiraF/PRNet/blob/fc12fe5e1f1462bdea52409b213d0cf1c8cf6c5b/utils/write.py#L16)  and face3d.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"cleardusk","id":7555251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTUyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7555251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk","html_url":"https://github.com/cleardusk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleardusk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
