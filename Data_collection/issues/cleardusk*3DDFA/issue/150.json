Below is an image, with parameters dimension 40+10, 60+29 and 199+29 (the original one). Compared to shape, expression clipping has more effect on reconstruction accuracy when emotion is involved. Therefore, you can choose a tradeoff between the speed/parameter-size and the accuracy. A recommendation of clipping trade-off is 60+29.”\r\n\r\nIs there a pre-trained model with 60+29 or 199+29 dimensional parameters available?\r\nIf I want to use 199+29 dimensional models, what should I do?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
