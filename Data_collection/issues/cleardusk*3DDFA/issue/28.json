Here I got a problem about the visual 3D face rendering results. For example, I run the render_demo.m under the folder ‘visualize’ , and the ‘test1_0.mat’ and 'test1_1.mat' are created by running the command 'python3 main.py -f samples/test1.jpg', the rendering result is about x-axis mirror symmetry with the result provided in the ‘test1_0.jpg’ and 'test1_1.jpg', which means the face is inverted. And I get the correct result by replace the command ‘vertex = load('test1_0');‘ with ’vertex = load('image00427');‘ which used the ’image00427.mat‘ you provided. Why I got this problem? I look forward to your reply.
