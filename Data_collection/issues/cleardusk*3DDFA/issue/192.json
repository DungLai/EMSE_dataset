I found some problems with the 300WLP dataset. Some landmark is wrong. \r\n300W_LP/IBUG/IBUG_image_011_1_0.mat\r\n300W_LP/IBUG/IBUG_image_011_1_10.mat\r\nThe files above have the exact same landmark while their faces are rotated. Besides, I would like to know what is the order of 300WLP pose annotation. The first three are pitch, yaw, and roll. They are in rad. How about f, x, y, z? Also, the angle seems to be the opposite. For example, positive pitch means looking down and in 300WLP is negative. positive yaw means looking left, while 300WLP is negative.\r\n ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/192/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
