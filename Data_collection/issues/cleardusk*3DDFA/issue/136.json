Thanks for this. \r\n\r\n- I am looking to make a model with 270 degree view with the hair/head. I've planned to use two side posed images for the reconstruction. Please guide me in which part do I need to rework and correct me if my path towards the objective is wrong. \r\n\r\n- Secondly, when I import the result obj in any designing software(Unity, Maya), the obj doesn't fit in the origin, every time it loads into different positions.
