Thanks for your amazing work. \r\nI'd like to use it as a base for further works. Could you please provide an explanation for the numpy matrices loaded in `params.py` ? In particular: \r\n* Keypoints\r\n* w_shp\r\n* w_exp\r\n* u_shp\r\n* u_exp\r\n\r\nI could be wrong but I am under the impression that these are base mesh data that are then deformed by the network's prediction. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help !
