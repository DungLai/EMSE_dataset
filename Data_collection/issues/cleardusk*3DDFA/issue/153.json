So I am curious how did your finetune WPDC model? Did you use arg of \"--frozen\" to make some layer with no grad? I try to write --frozen==\"true\" in .sh, but make no sense. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your reply.","closed_by":{"login":"stoneyang159","id":28418689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDE4Njg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28418689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159","html_url":"https://github.com/stoneyang159","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoneyang159/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
