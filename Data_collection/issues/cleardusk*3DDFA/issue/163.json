I am very interested in it and would like to ask some questions about the details. \r\n\r\nFrom the training code it seems that the model is regressing the pose, shape and expression parameters. By my understanding, the shape and expression ground-truth parameters are from the bilinear face model, but how to get the ground-truth pose parameters?\r\n\r\nAnother question, is there any way to derive the expression blendshapes or blendshape weight scores from the model output given an arbitrary input face image?\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to your reply and thank you in advance.
