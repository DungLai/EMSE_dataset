Why are the nasal structures of all exits the same? I have a bulge and deviation on my nose, but the nose model makes my nose look very beautiful. It's like I've had a nose job. Is there a way to improve the work and make more realistic models?\r\nI think the model is not working correctly in determining the depth of the image. Therefore, it does not recognize the protrusion of the nose.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
