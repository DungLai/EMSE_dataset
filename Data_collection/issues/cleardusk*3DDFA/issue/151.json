I can't tell from the file produced but I believe you are producing x,y,z for facial coordinates.  If this is the case it would be nice to be able to import the motion capture data into 3D programs such as Blender,Maya,Unity etc.  A standard format for importing is .[fbx ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX)which is preferable.
