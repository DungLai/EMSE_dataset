I have one question about 3D Image Rotation. I currently implement rotation method based on face3d, but I meet one problem about background. According to your paper, I realize that face image is rotated with a background. It seems be very good. Can you explain it and share your code about that ?\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-11-16 09-34-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50879191/141885424-1f769a70-c3c5-42d1-b275-0772a56209ee.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
