I found that in the benchmark testing code, when calculating NME we are using [:2,:] to project the 3d result into 2d. Since in the paper people are using to present both 2d and 3d 68-point NME results, I wonder if we want to test with 3d coordinate directly, should we just remove the :2 and use the whole coordinate?
