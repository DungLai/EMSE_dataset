To train smaller models? In fact, I found that the number of simplified expression parameters has a great impact on the accuracy of 3D key point location, but the simplified shape parameters have little effect. I think we need to do batch testing to find the best simplified parameters for shape and expression.","closed_by":{"login":"chengfeng0113","id":12129147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTI5MTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12129147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113","html_url":"https://github.com/chengfeng0113","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengfeng0113/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cleardusk/3DDFA/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
