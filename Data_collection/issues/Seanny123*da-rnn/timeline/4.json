Besides, are you running on GPU? Can all GPU resources be called? I think maybe the Pytorch version (PyTorch0.3.0) or the delay in sending and receiving data causes me to not use the

from the Abstract of DA-RNN paper:\r\n> The Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX)\r\n model, which predicts the current value of a time\r\n series based upon its previous values as well as the\r\n current and past values of multiple driving (exogenous) series, has been studied for decades.\r\n\r\nTheir scenario setup are based on NARX,\r\nBy googling \"NARX\", two types of problem definition were found, differed in U(t) (exogenous driving in time t) is included or not.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_autoregressive_exogenous_model\r\nhttps://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/design-time-series-narx-feedback-neural-networks.html\r\n\r\nIn the paper it gives two experiments, SML 2010 and NASDAQ 100:\r\nIn SML 2020, by checking the attributes definition: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SML2010\r\nIt makes sense to include U(t) in prediction of Y(t), since we don't know the mysterious relation between Temp. and the exogenous driving such as Wind speed,  CO2 ppm, Date, etc.\r\n\r\nBut in NASDAQ100, the experiment setup is somewhat ambiguous. Since NASDAQ100 index can be directly computed using market-cap weighted method in real time, given its 100 composites prices. So if U covers all 100 composites, U(t) can produce Y(t) at 100% accuracy, it becomes a failed-setup prediction problem. But in the paper: \r\n> In the NASDAQ 100 Stock dataset1, we collected the stock\r\nprices of 81 major corporations under NASDAQ 100, which\r\nare used as the driving time series. The index value of the\r\nNASDAQ 100 is used as the target series.\r\n\r\nOnly 81 composites were used in U, so the inclusion of U(t) in prediction of Y(t) still can be said a meaningful problem setup, though it contributes most part of the learning effort.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seanny123/da-rnn/issues/comments/483521952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yitelee","id":23636156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM2MTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23636156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee","html_url":"https://github.com/yitelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yitelee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
