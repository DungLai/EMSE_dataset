He presented in his blog, i.e. \"Unlike the experiment presented in the paper, which uses the contemporary values of exogenous factors to predict the target variable, I exclude them.\". What the mean is that instead of inputting synchronous external factors when predicting the target series, he only used the past values of all external series to predict the target time series? Instead, current values of external factor are not used for prediction in his code?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seanny123/da-rnn/issues/4/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Seanny123/da-rnn/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
