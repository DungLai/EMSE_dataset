that sounds good! I'd like to run a weakly supervised experiment using label maker, but I would only use label maker to classify satellite patches that have buildings and satellite patches that don't, and then use the concepts described by this paper https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feeback-neural-network.pdf? to perform segmentation. You may want to look into it too for later, since this paper proposes better results than u-net!\r\n\r\n- On a side note, I tried to download images via label-maker and I included my map-box access key as an environment variable. The commands ran great, but when I tried to preview the downloaded images, the file was rendered un-openable for some reason. I used the same config.json described in the example for Tanzania. Would appreciate any leads! I'm guessing it has to do with permissions on my access key?\r\n\r\nThanks in
