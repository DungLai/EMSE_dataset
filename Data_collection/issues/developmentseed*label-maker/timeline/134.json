it really depends on the size of the bounding box and the density of the OSM data in that region. Unfortunately there isn't a perfect way to query OSM data for this project, in my understanding it's a tradeoff between two main options:\r\n- [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) allows for arbitrary queries on OSM data but each hosted instance has rate limits which I'd worry about exceeding for large tasks.\r\n- [OSM QA Tiles](https://osmlab.github.io/osm-qa-tiles/) have all the necessary data per country but require post-processing because they are made available at zoom level 12.\r\n\r\nUltimately we went with the second option. To get the tile data at the zoom requested by the user, we:\r\n- convert the `mbtiles` file to GeoJSON using `tippecanoe-decode`\r\n- filter that using the input bounding box to speed up the following step\r\n- retile at the desired zoom level using `tippecanoe`\r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a hack and in my mind is the weakest part of the library.

unfortunately the folder structure is required right now when using the CLI. If you call the functions directly (e.g. `from label_maker.label import make_labels`) you can specify exact file paths.\r\n\r\nIt also looks like you will run into some issues with the OSM filters. The format `[\"has\", \"tag\"]` only checks for the existence of a tag, not for any of its values. So this is suitable for things like `[\"has\", \"building\"]` or `[\"has\", \"highway\"]` but not much else. To match a specific tag and value combination, I'd recommend the `==` operator. Here is an example for matching [trees](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:natural=tree): `[\"==\", \"natural\", \"tree\"]`\r\n\r\nLet me know if that all
