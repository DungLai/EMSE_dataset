Assuming you will see duplicated bboxes over the tile borders. I would write something like, if neighboring two bboxes' IOU > 80%, you will count them as one bbox instead of two. \r\n\r\nHope this is helpful. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/comments/453628687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Geoyi","id":14057932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDU3OTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14057932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi","html_url":"https://github.com/Geoyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geoyi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2069353506,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA2OTM1MzUwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/events/2069353506","actor":{"login":"Geo-Trackers","id":7304644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers","html_url":"https://github.com/Geo-Trackers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-11T19:23:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2069353508,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNjkzNTM1MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/events/2069353508","actor":{"login":"Geo-Trackers","id":7304644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers","html_url":"https://github.com/Geo-Trackers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geo-Trackers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-11T19:23:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
