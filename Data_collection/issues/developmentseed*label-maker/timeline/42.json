I did try on two different computers, both of which got the same 196 image titles.\r\n\r\nYou might want to replace the bounding box in your configure file with:\r\n [-99.17667388916016,19.466430383606728,-99.11865234374999,19.51813278329343]\r\n\r\n> The original folder name in the zip file ssd_inception_v2_coco is ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17, so I had to change the folder name to ssd_inception_v2_coco. You might want to note this in your tutorial.\r\n\r\nActually, the `ssd_inception_v2_coco.config` is a different file from the folder `ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17`, you should just download our config file [here](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/examples/utils/ssd_inception_v2_coco.config). DON'T change the folder name, otherwise you will need to change the path in the config file as well. The folder `ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17` is the model checkpoint, and model config file `ssd_inception_v2_coco.config` is setup to pull everything together for the `train.py` if that makes sense.\r\n\r\n> `module 'tensorflow.contrib.slim.python.slim.data.tfexample_decoder' has no attribute 'BackupHandler'`\r\n\r\nNot sure how this happened, but you can do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# From

Thanks for your hints! I tried your new bounding box, now I got 227 image tiles. Nevermind, now I know what the problem is and I can play with the bounding box. \r\n\r\nRegarding the config file, I did use the provided [`ssd_inception_v2_coco.config`](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/examples/utils/ssd_inception_v2_coco.config). What I meant was the folder name within the downloaded zip file [`ssd_inception_v2_coco`](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17.tar.gz). After checking the [`ssd_inception_v2_coco.config`](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/examples/utils/ssd_inception_v2_coco.config) Line 152, I realized that I should not have changed the folder name `ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17`. \r\n\r\nSo the folder structure should probably be:\r\n```\r\nmodels/research/object_detection/\r\n├──ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17/\r\n├── training/\r\n│   └── ssd_inception_v2_coco.config\r\n├── data/\r\n│   ├── train_buildings.record\r\n│   ├── test_buildings.record\r\n│   └── building_od.pbtxt\r\n└── images/\r\n    ├── train/\r\n    └── test/\r\n```\r\nI guess the folder structure in your tutorial is missing the partial folder name **_2017_11_17**\r\n\r\nI have tried every possible way I could, but I still could not by bypass the `'BackupHandler'` error. I guess I have to wait until I upgrade to tensorflow v1.4 and cuda9.0 to test the code again.
