We've thought about it a little but don't have any great ideas currently for dealing with it. Ideally we'll gradually move away from the \"rigidity\" of the current tile approach and into something that supports the above case. I think #13 will involve GeoTIFF reading according to a tile schema but we'll want to eventually relax that to support sliding window approaches/reads and then we'll have to develop a better \"non-tile\" schema.\r\n\r\nAlso object-detection is currently the least well documented case (pending some help in #30) so happy for new ideas or approaches here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/comments/359916106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1438143614,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQzODE0MzYxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/events/1438143614","actor":{"login":"lewfish","id":1896461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTY0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1896461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish","html_url":"https://github.com/lewfish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-23T20:14:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1438143616,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MzgxNDM2MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/events/1438143616","actor":{"login":"lewfish","id":1896461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTY0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1896461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish","html_url":"https://github.com/lewfish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewfish/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-23T20:14:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-23T20:30:05Z","updated_at":"2018-01-23T20:30:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/events","html_url":"https://github.com/development

work on [Raster Vision](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision) at Azavea and this library seems to handle some of the same functionality. We create object detection training chips from GeoTIFFs and human-generated GeoJSON label files, and I'm thinking about how to extend `label-maker` to do this. Do you think this would be in the scope of `label-maker`, or is the focus just on generating labels from OSM data? Handling human-generated label files would make the library more general and usable with pre-existing benchmark datasets, for instance. I saw that there's an issue (#13) for handling GeoTIFFs instead of TMS URLs, which would be step one. The next step would be handling GeoJSON labels, or GeoTIFFs in the case of segmentation. Or maybe the right approach is to convert our data into vector tiles which this library already handles.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-31T00:32:17Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T00:32:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jremillard/images-to-osm/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jremillard/images-to-osm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jremillard/images-to-osm/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jremillard/images-to-osm/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jremillard/images-to-osm/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jremillard/images-to-osm/issues/2","id":285702875,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODU3MDI4NzU=","number":2,"title":"Microsoft/Bing
