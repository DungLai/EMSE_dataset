Thanks for looking in to this. I should have time to make changes based on your findings before my project deadline.\r\n\r\nMy previous approach was to first run:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ label-maker download --dest <example> --config <example>.json\r\n$ label-maker labels --dest <example> --config <example>.json\r\n$ label-maker images --dest <example> --config <example>.json\r\n```\r\nI would then manually inspect the images that had been downloaded - deleting those which were either cloud covered, or poor quality (a high proportion when requesting data at 14 zoom level!) to create a cleansed folder of images.\r\nMy next step was to run the final CLI command to creates a data.npz file:\r\n```shell\r\n$ label-maker package --dest <example> --config <example>.json \r\n```\r\nThis has taken me quite some time, so could you confirm whether it would be possible to copy the cleansed image folders already created in to a different directory and from there, make changes to the config file to reduce risk of boundary overlap and simply run the following:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ label-maker download --dest <example_2> --config <example_2>.json\r\n$ label-maker labels --dest <example_2> --config <example_2>.json\r\n\r\n$ label-maker package --dest <example_2> --config <example_2>.json \r\n```\r\n\r\nOr would I need to re-download and re-cleanse the images for each country?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nJosh\r\n\r\nP.s.
