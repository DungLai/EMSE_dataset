work on [Raster Vision](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision) at Azavea and this library seems to handle some of the same functionality. We create object detection training chips from GeoTIFFs and human-generated GeoJSON label files, and I'm thinking about how to extend `label-maker` to do this. Do you think this would be in the scope of `label-maker`, or is the focus just on generating labels from OSM data? Handling human-generated label files would make the library more general and usable with pre-existing benchmark datasets, for instance. I saw that there's an issue (#13) for handling GeoTIFFs instead of TMS URLs, which would be step one. The next step would be handling GeoJSON labels, or GeoTIFFs in the case of segmentation. Or maybe the right approach is to convert our data into vector tiles which this library already handles.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-23T20:14:56Z","updated_at":"2018-01-23T20:14:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/31","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/31/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/31/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/31/events","html_url":"https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/31","id":290945464,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTA5NDU0NjQ=","number":31,"title":"Handling

my understanding of how `label-maker` works, tile extents are static (and based on the mbtile files), and with `ml_type=='object-detection'`, objects that straddle tile boundaries will be split up in the training data. Ideally, the tile bounds would be generated dynamically so that it could generate tiles that contain the entire object, which should help the model learn better. However, fixing this would probably complicate the implementation (which I think is elegant, btw), and might not be worth it assuming there aren't many objects that straddle tiles, or if you want to be able to detect partial, clipped objects.
