We've seen if the MapBox imagery API token is not set up correctly, the image tiles can be blank. \r\n\r\n- ### problem 2, the data.npz is not at the corrected directory for the model to read the data. \r\nFor this problem, can you just check with the function `prep_data` (run it in your notebook cell separately with `find_file` function) if it prints out the correct data input shape?  The shape of the data should be ((1831, 3, 256, 256), (458, 3, 256, 256), (1831,), (458,)) for X_train, X_test, Y_train and Y_test. \r\n\r\n- ### S3 bucket\r\nIf you think the first two were not the problems. \r\nYou did not mention you have set up an S3 bucket, so I'm just guessing it can cause a problem too. I remember I saved data.npz in an s3 bucket, and give the s3 URL in the second cell `mxnet_estimator.fit`, where you found the error you mentioned above. It was not a problem that read data.npz from the root directory, but SageMaker continues being updated by the AWS team, so I'm not sure if you're assumed to feed data through S3 now.  For details see [here](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/mxnet/README.rst#training-with-mxnet).\r\n\r\nLet me know if we can help further.

ody":"@Geoyi Thanks for getting back to me. I had written a much longer response, but for some reason GitHub has not saved this comment.\r\n\r\nEssentially I have investigated both __problem 1__ and __problem 2__ and both give the expected results.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that the issue is with the __S3 Bucket__, and have tried multiple approaches on this. None of which have been successful. Would you be able to run the example on your own sagemaker notebook instance and if it functions as expected share the syntax/approach used in the `mxnet_estimator.fit` argument? Or any other changes you make?\r\n\r\nMany

I finally solved the problem and took me a whole morning today, @joshwapiano, and @mapmeld. \r\nYou're right about S3 bucket and `prep_data(find_file( ... ))`, @mapmeld. I deleted `find_file( ... )` function. And @joshwapiano, SageMaker team dosen't do a good job of documenting their work. \r\n\r\nAdditional things I did:\r\n- S3 bucket need to [have 'sagemaker' in the name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html);\r\n- create a notebook using `conda-mxnet_p27` instead of their python 3.6. Appearantly, the `MXNet` only works with python 2.7 and 3.5, so their `conda-mxnet_p36` won't work. It gave me `no sagemaker.mxnet module` error.\r\n- The `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'`error you originally got was caused by the data could not be parsed to the model correctly from S3 bucket.
