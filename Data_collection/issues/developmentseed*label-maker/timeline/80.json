If it's the latter, I'm not sure that it would work even if it were identified correctly. Probably the easiest way to test is running `rio insp [endpoint]` (since we're using the same loading mechanism).\r\n\r\nAs for the larger issue (can we identify remote files as valid TIF without using the extension), I'm not too sure but happy for suggestions.
