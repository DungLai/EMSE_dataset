Thanks for your reply. Actually, I was trying to use label-maker to prepare training samples for Mask-RCNN, this is why I need to use ml_type as segmentation. Then the tf_records_generation.py cannot meet the demand, since the training samples should contain mask and bounding boxes, not only the bounding boxes. I found some similar script here: [create_mask_rcnn_tf_record.py](https://gist.github.com/TheFlashover/34a1390a0e3e3c620e1850a72cb5826e)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/comments/472515098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bobleegogogo","id":33456076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDU2MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33456076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo","html_url":"https://github.com/bobleegogogo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobleegogogo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2200976115,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIwMDk3NjExNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/events/2200976115","actor":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T17:04:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2200976118,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMDA5NzYxMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/events/2200976118","actor":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T17:04:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
