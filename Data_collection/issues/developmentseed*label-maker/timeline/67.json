Otherwise, you can end up with having more buildings in validation set but fewer buildings go to train the models. But if you have hug dataset for object detection, it totally makes more sense to slip up the train and validation by tiles.

there, \r\n    I have tried witht he example of : A building detector with TensorFlow API at mexico city, I just follow all the default setting of boundary box and training model. Then I got my model trained as well as the test result, the question is that from the blog page\" There are 227 buildings in the test dataset, and 191 buildings are predicted correctly by the model (84%).\" \r\n    I was wondering that is this \"84%\" refer to the precision? If not, what's this number means?  For my own model, I trained it around 20000, and select one of the check point in \"training\" folders, then got only precision around 20%, so I want to know how we could select the best checkpoint during the training? or we just monitoring the loss and select some checkpoint manually?\r\n\r\nBest
