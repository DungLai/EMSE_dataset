Hi Drew, I have tried to modify my personal dataset using your workflow. There are a few things that I want to mention and ask.\r\n\r\n1. Thank you for recommending the osmium-tool. It is very useful for building a personal dataset, especially when you want to filter data by tags. \r\n\r\n2. I want to filter data by contributors and I found 'osmium changeset-filter' can be used for this purpose, as it offer a -u option for filtering changeset by contributor's username. However, it seems the pbf file I downloaded [https://download.geofabrik.de/australia-oceania/new-zealand.html](url) does not contain metadata like username. Is there any alternative option in order to filter data by using username?\r\n\r\n3.  geojson.io seems like the popular option for editing geojson files. However, I'm not sure why it tries to make all multipolygons ready for changes when a user click the edit button. When, I tried to modify polygons in my area of interest, it simply froze and cannot make any change to any polygon. I'm not sure if this only happens to me.\r\n\r\n4.  I mentioned an issue about tile images downloaded by label-maker are sometimes corrupted in #141 . This also happens in geojson.io when you use satellite images, which makes it sometimes impossible for modifying some polygon masks in corrupted regions.
