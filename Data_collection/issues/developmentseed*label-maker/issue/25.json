At least 100 tiles appear to be completely white (100% cloud cover) with the smallest file size (1.7 kb - 3.3 kb). Most image tiles without cloud cover are larger than 5.0 kb. Using these high cloud cover image titles for training could potentially influence the classification accuracy. I know this problem is caused by the Mapbox satellite images, but I was wondering if it could be possible for the label-maker to somehow identify these high cloud cover image tiles and eliminate them from being used for training?\r\n\r\nBTW, I trained the Vietnam example on my 64-bit Linux machine (i7-4790 CPU, 32 GB RAM, NVIDIA EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU) using the [resnet.py](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/examples/nets/resnet.py) script. The training took approximately 76 minutes. The test accuracy is 83.22%. \r\n\r\nThank you for developing such a great tool! It makes my life much easier!  \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"giswqs","id":5016453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTY0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5016453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs","html_url":"https://github.com/giswqs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
