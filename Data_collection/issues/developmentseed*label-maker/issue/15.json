At that point it may be better to read the training data in with a generator (example: [Keras flow_from_directory](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/)). The easiest way to do this now would be to skip the final step (`label-maker package`) and read directly from the `labels.npz` and the `tiles` directory. We should create either (1) an example showing how to do this or (2) additional scripts which perform this for the user depending upon configuration (or a combination of the two).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/15/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
