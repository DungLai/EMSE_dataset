I trained my model using Tensorflow object detection API. Now, I want to run inference over my satellite image tiles. I want to  use gdaltools to generate image tiles and run inference over each tiles, and stich them back together for visualization over the large area of satellite imagery? Also, if my brick kiln falls in two image tiles, will the script tf_od_predict.py compute non-maximum suppression and get rid of low probability predictions, while i stich the images tiles back together.\r\nThank you. I look forward to hear from you.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
