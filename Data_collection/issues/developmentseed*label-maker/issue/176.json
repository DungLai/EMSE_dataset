I set the bounding_box in config.json to [0,0, 100,100].\r\n2. I download labels within the bounding box\r\n3. I download tiles of size 20*20. One of the downloaded tiles is \"Tile X\" with coordinates [90,90, 110,110].\r\n4. In tile X, my model detects an \"object O\" at coords [105, 105, 106, 106].\r\n5. This object is however not in labels because it is outside of the bounding box set in config.json. So it seems like a \"false positive\" when actually the detection is correct.\r\n\r\nIs this known/desired?\r\n\r\nI imagine a functionality could be added that would check coordinates of tiles and then download all labels within the tiles.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
