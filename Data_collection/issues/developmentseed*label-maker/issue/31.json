Ideally, the tile bounds would be generated dynamically so that it could generate tiles that contain the entire object, which should help the model learn better. However, fixing this would probably complicate the implementation (which I think is elegant, btw), and might not be worth it assuming there aren't many objects that straddle tiles, or if you want to be able to detect partial, clipped objects. I was just wondering if this is something you've considered.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/31/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
