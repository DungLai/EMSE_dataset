We create object detection training chips from GeoTIFFs and human-generated GeoJSON label files, and I'm thinking about how to extend `label-maker` to do this. Do you think this would be in the scope of `label-maker`, or is the focus just on generating labels from OSM data? Handling human-generated label files would make the library more general and usable with pre-existing benchmark datasets, for instance. I saw that there's an issue (#13) for handling GeoTIFFs instead of TMS URLs, which would be step one. The next step would be handling GeoJSON labels, or GeoTIFFs in the case of segmentation. Or maybe the right approach is to convert our data into vector tiles which this library already handles.","closed_by":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
