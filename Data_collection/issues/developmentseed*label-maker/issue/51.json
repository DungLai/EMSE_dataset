I was preparing data for a fairly small region and ended up with 156250 tiles in total. Of which about 50000 are in one of my classes. Running `label-maker images` took a long time so I started investigating and switching from `.npz` to a pickle means it starts downloading tiles more or less immediately. Before I had to wait a very long time (minutes or more?) to get to the bit when it starts downloading.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like something you'd be open to I'd contribute a PR.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/51/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/51/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
