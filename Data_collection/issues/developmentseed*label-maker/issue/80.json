The URL given above, which is the `imagery` entry in my config file, has no extension.v Therefore, the image is not identified as TIF. Because the image is not identified as a TIF, it is downloaded as a TMS ([here](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/label_maker/utils.py#L27)), which again looks for an extension (and finds none) and uses that to apply to the downloaded tile.\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can force `label-maker images` to download my COG from the endpoint as a TIF?","closed_by":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/80/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/80/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
