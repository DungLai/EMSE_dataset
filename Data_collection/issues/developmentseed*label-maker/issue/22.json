All label-maker commands (i.e., `download, labels, preview, images`) worked fine except the `label-maker package` command. \r\n\r\nFor the Vietnam example, the `label-maker images` command did download 2296 tiles. However, when using the `label-maker package` command, I got the following errors. I checked the filenames of the titles shown in the error list below and found that they are not among the 2299 tiles downloaded. I had similar issues with the Tanzania example. \r\n\r\nAny help will be appreciated!\r\n\r\n************************************* errors *******************************************\r\n(py36) qiusheng@office:/tmp$ label-maker images --dest Vietnam_building --config Vietnam.json\r\nDownloading 2296 tiles to Vietnam_building/tiles\r\n(py36) qiusheng@office:/tmp$ label-maker package --dest Vietnam_building --config Vietnam.json\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/103935-57783-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/104132-57663-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/103998-57519-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/104007-57744-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/103990-57746-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/103973-57637-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/104061-57529-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/103977-57720-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/104009-57794-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/104224-57747-17.jpg, skipping\r\n......\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/104194-57708-17.jpg, skipping\r\nCouldn't open Vietnam_building/tiles/104265-57705-17.jpg, skipping\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/qiusheng/anaconda3/envs/py36/bin/label-maker\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(cli())\r\n  File \"/home/qiusheng/anaconda3/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/label_maker/main.py\", line 87, in cli\r\n    package_directory(dest_folder=dest_folder, **config)\r\n  File \"/home/qiusheng/anaconda3/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/label_maker/package.py\", line 61, in package_directory\r\n    img = Image.open(image_file)\r\n  File \"/home/qiusheng/anaconda3/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PIL/Image.py\", line 2572, in open\r\n    % (filename if filename else fp))\r\nOSError: cannot identify image file 'Vietnam_building/tiles/104173-57771-17.jpg'\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"giswqs","id":5016453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTY0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5016453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs","html_url":"https://github.com/giswqs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
