Then I got my model trained as well as the test result, the question is that from the blog page\" There are 227 buildings in the test dataset, and 191 buildings are predicted correctly by the model (84%).\" \r\n    I was wondering that is this \"84%\" refer to the precision? If not, what's this number means?  For my own model, I trained it around 20000, and select one of the check point in \"training\" folders, then got only precision around 20%, so I want to know how we could select the best checkpoint during the training? or we just monitoring the loss and select some checkpoint manually?\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nHao","closed_by":{"login":"drewbo","id":7108211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDgyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo","html_url":"https://github.com/drewbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/57/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/57/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
