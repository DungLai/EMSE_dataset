I'm trying to train a model to detect farmland. However, the tiles seem to be correctly labeled. I checked OSM, and the areas are appropriated labeled. For some reason, my tiles seem to make no sense with what they're labeled. Can't figure out any rhyme or reason why certain features are incorrectly labeled. For example, the golf course is classed as farmland, as are some random buildings. There are also far too few tiles labeled as agriculture: should be well over half of the AOI. \r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what the issue would be.
