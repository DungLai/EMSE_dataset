All of them have the same error message above. I did try label-maker on a virtual machine with Ubuntu, and it works fine. So I guess the error is specific to Manjaro Linux. I did Google, but failed to find any solution. \r\n\r\nI am wondering if there is any other Manjaro user having this issue? Any help would be appreciated.
