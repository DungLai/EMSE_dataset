Download an entire country QA file\r\n2. Use `tippecanoe-decode` + `stream-filter.js` to create a GeoJSON of all features in just the desired bounding box.\r\n3. Retile this data using `tippecanoe` to the desired zoom level.\r\n\r\nIn theory, this would be possible to do much faster (although with more dependencies) if there were a way to fetch arbitrary tiles (or bounding boxes) from OSM QA data through another method (possibly a third party service)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/14/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
