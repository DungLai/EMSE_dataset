I do see that there is already some existing work around tfrecords creation for object detection data https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/examples/utils/tf_records_generation.py. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"martham93","id":13889100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg5MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13889100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93","html_url":"https://github.com/martham93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martham93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
