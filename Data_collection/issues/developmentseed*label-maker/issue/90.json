The data.npz file is sitting in the sagemaker folder, and I'm having no problem reading it when running the relevant sections of mx_lenet_sagemaker.py in a new notebook on the instance, however when I run the second cell of [SageMaker_mx-lenet](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/examples/nets/SageMaker_mx-lenet.ipynb) I hit the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Error training sagemaker-mxnet-2018-07-08-18-12-13-217: Failed Reason: AlgorithmError: uncaught exception during training: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/container_support/training.py\", line 36, in start\r\n    fw.train()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mxnet_container/train.py\", line 191, in train\r\n    model = user_module.train(**kwargs_to_pass)\r\n  File \"/opt/ml/code/mx_lenet_sagemaker.py\", line 92, in train\r\n    train_iter, val_iter = prep_data(data_path)\r\n  File \"/opt/ml/code/mx_lenet_sagemaker.py\", line 14, in prep_data\r\n    data = np.load(find_file(data_path, 'data.npz'))\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py\", line 402, in load\r\n    magic = fid.read(N)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'\r\n```\r\nAfter several hours trying different fixes I'm having little to no luck debugging, but was hoping you could check the example to ensure it runs fine when you attempt it?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
