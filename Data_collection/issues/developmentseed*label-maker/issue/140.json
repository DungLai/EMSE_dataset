I found this project really promising. However, I also found out some masked areas in the openstreetmap contain false-positives. For example, mask data imported from LINZ's topographic maps are usually shifted from actual tree areas. I'm wondering with current utility of the config.json file, is there anyway to filter such data out of my training dataset as I don't want too much FP? \r\n\r\nHere is my current config file:\r\n`\r\n      \"country\": \"new_zealand\",\r\n      \"bounding_box\": [175.1848,-37.8868,175.4386,-37.6892],\r\n       \"zoom\": 18,\r\n       \"classes\": [    { \"name\": \"Woods\", \"filter\": [\"==\", \"natural\", \"wood\"] }     ],\r\n       \"imagery\": \"http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.satellite/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg?access_token=MY_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\r\n       \"background_ratio\": 1,\r\n       \"ml_type\": \"segmentation\"\r\n`\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
