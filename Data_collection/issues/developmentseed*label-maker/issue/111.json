I am trying to use your toolkit to conduct my own research using satellite imagery. But unfortunately I am hitting a wall when I try.\r\n\r\nI am running python 3.6.6 on pyenv (I noticed that label-maker doesn't seem to work on python 2.7) and I have installed label-maker using the procedure you explain here: http://devseed.com/label-maker/\r\n\r\nUsing the sample `config.json` you suggest in your documentation I then run `label-maker download`, this seems to create a valid sqlite3 mbtiles file on ~/data, all fine so far. After that I try to run `label-maker labels` and that fails with the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlabel-maker labels\r\nRetiling QA Tiles to zoom level 12 (takes a bit)\r\ntippecanoe-decode: invalid option -- 'c'\r\nUsage: tippecanoe-decode file.mbtiles zoom x y\r\ntippecanoe: invalid option -- '-'\r\nUsage: tippecanoe -o out.mbtiles [-n name] [-l layername] [-z maxzoom] [-Z minzoom] [-B basezoom] [-d detail] [-D lower-detail] [-m min-detail] [-x excluded-field ...] [-y included-field ...] [-X] [-r droprate] [-b buffer] [-t tmpdir] [-a rco] [-p sfkld] [-q] [-P] [file.json ...]\r\nDetermining labels for each tile\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/zilog/.pyenv/versions/3.6.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tilepie/reader.py\", line 42, in _query\r\n    self._cur.execute(sql, *args)\r\nsqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: tiles\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/zilog/.pyenv/versions/3.6.6/bin/label-maker\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    load_entry_point('label-maker==0.4.0', 'console_scripts', 'label-maker')()\r\n  File \"/home/zilog/.pyenv/versions/3.6.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/label_maker/main.py\", line 84, in cli\r\n    make_labels(dest_folder=dest_folder, sparse=sparse, **config)\r\n  File \"/home/zilog/.pyenv/versions/3.6.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/label_maker/label.py\", line 85, in make_labels\r\n    _mapper, _callback, _done)\r\n  File \"/home/zilog/.pyenv/versions/3.6.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tilepie/__init__.py\", line 26, in tilereduce\r\n    tilecontent = uncompress(tm.tile(tile[0], tile[1], tile[2]))\r\n  File \"/home/zilog/.pyenv/versions/3.6.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tilepie/reader.py\", line 60, in tile\r\n    WHERE zoom_level=?

Any help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
