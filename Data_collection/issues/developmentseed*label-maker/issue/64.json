Hex vals are available in the PR.\r\n\r\nThe most complete solution would be to find/write a function that takes number of colors as input, and spits back an idealized list of RGB/Hex vals. This might be overkill though -- a simpler solution would be to cycle through a fixed set of colors that are known to be color blind friendly (like Tableau 10 or something analogous). The latter solution is also nice because we won't add a dependency.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wronk","id":5296721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTY3MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5296721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk","html_url":"https://github.com/wronk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wronk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/64/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/64/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
