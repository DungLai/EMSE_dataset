I set the `background_ratio` to 1 and assumed Label Maker will create a balance classes ratio. But in this case, the bounding box only contained building tiles, and I ended up only have 9 tiles are the background tiles out of 340 tiles. If we can add the class imbalance warning that will help to evaluate the training dataset. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/developmentseed/label-maker/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
