The code assumes everything is unsigned data which will look like \"jumps\" from a very small value to a large value as the data moves past 0. It's a non-trivial problem to automatically detect whether data is signed or unsigned. \r\n\r\nIf you ctrl+f for \"signed\" in the code I believe there's a comment where this assumption is implemented.
