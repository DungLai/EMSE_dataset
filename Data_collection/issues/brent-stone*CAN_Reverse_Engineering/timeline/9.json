Here's a link to the issue tracker on the pandas-dev repo: [https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/37094](url) Currently the bug is slated to be fixed in the 1.1.4 release which is due to come out tomorrow on October 30th. It appears that it is related to the index_col argument for read_csv() when > 1000000 lines, so a quick fix would be to set index separately from read_csv() instead of including it as an argument or to process fewer than 1000000 lines per file. Here's an example from the issue tracker:\r\n\r\n> I can confirm I have the same problem, which arises as soon as I pass the threshold of 1M rows.\r\n> \r\n> I only need to specify `index_col` to get the bug, though. Specifying `dtypes` is not needed.\r\n> \r\n> Pandas 1.1.3\r\n> \r\n> And as a temporary workaround, I am reading without `index_col`, and then setting my index. E.g.\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> df = pd.read_csv(filepath, nrows=1000001)\r\n> df.set_index(0) # for example if I wanted the first column\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIn short, upgrade to pandas 1.1.4 or downgrade to pandas 1.1.2 and this should be fixed. Since the issue is not with this repo I don't think any changes are needed besides changing requirements.txt line 2 from  \r\n```pandas``` \r\nto\r\n```pandas>=1.1.4```\r\nor\r\n```pandas<=1.1.2```\r\nI am not familiar with requirements.txt syntax, so if there's a way to specifically exclude only version 1.1.3, that would be ideal.
