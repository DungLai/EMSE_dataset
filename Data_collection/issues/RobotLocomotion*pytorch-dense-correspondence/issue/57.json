discussion with Yunzhu think about how to get batch normalization to work with out setup.\r\n\r\nOne potential idea.\r\n- Sample N pairs of images (this will be our batch)\r\n- For each image pair we can choose find matches `[m_a, m_b]` and non-matches `[nm_a, nm_b]`. \r\n- Run all 2*N images thru the network simultaneously, this is where we can do batch-normalization.\r\n- Compute the loss function as usual and do back-prop.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings to be careful about.\r\n- Masked matches vs. non-masked
