However, the environment set up is not working. The `use_director` command only does `PATH=$PATH:~/director/bin`, but apparently this is not enough. When I'm trying to run \"run_change_detection_pipeline.py\", there are many failed attempts to import director and PythonQt, etc. \r\n\r\nCould you please help fix this pipeline as we are trying to use your work on some other data. \r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"kudo1026","id":16885585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg1NTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16885585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026","html_url":"https://github.com/kudo1026","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
