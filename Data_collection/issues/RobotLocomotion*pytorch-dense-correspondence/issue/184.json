There is a problem in the newer version: 0.1.8.7 which has been discussed in [Visdom Issues: #548](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom/issues/548). \r\nMy solution is:\r\nChange the line in install_pytorch.sh files:\r\nfrom:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install visdom\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install visdom==0.1.8.6\r\n```\r\nSo everything was ok and I finished the installation guide successfully.
