I kept on having issues where training the network wouldn't work since nothing would be loaded onto the GPU. Installing PyTorch locally for CUDA 10.0 did not work. So, I discovered I had to modify this script and change the pytorch installations for CUDA 10.0:\r\n\r\n**pytorch-dense-correspondence/docker/install_pytorch.sh**\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu100/torch-1.1.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl\r\nsudo pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu100/torchvision-0.3.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl\r\n\r\nsudo pip3 install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu100/torch-1.1.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl\r\nsudo pip3 install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu100/torchvision-0.3.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be best if there was a disclaimer to change these installation URLs in the URL to stay up-to-date with both PyTorch (currently listed as 0.3.0 in the install script) as well as CUDA. I can create a pull request if you want.","closed_by":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
