This translates to an average descriptor distance between matches off `sqrt(0.1) = 0.3` which seems incredibly large given that `M_pixel = 0.5`. This is doubly confusing since the hard negative rate for masked non-matches is fairly low at 4%. So only 4% of non-matches are below the 0.3 distance.\r\n\r\nI think this could potentially be fixed by lowering the learning rate.","closed_by":{"login":"peteflorence","id":5640360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDAzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5640360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence","html_url":"https://github.com/peteflorence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
