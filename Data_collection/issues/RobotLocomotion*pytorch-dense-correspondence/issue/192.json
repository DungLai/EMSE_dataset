Finally, the first (test) notebook you point to, works.\r\n\r\nThen I go into the training_notebook, and ran into [this issue](https://github.com/warmspringwinds/pytorch-segmentation-detection/issues/11): ```_init__() got an unexpected keyword argument \"fully_conv\"```, which had me clean up your dependency install file (pytorch outdated, pip outdated; reminder: there's only 7 months left of support for python 2.7..), which I have not been able to fix and has made me come here to ask for help. Do you have any idea about this problem? \r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\nExample the dependencies in your notebooks dont work outside of the box (modules.x prefix missing):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4501464/57235791-f51d1180-7023-11e9-8910-7c7e3fcec3f4.png)\r\n\r\nSecond error I haven't been able to fix:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4501464/57235919-43321500-7024-11e9-9b1c-3aaace483c57.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"peteflorence","id":5640360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDAzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5640360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence","html_url":"https://github.com/peteflorence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
