It's an easy fix I believe. The pipeline for actually generating the dataset from a reconstruction is pretty involved and specific to our setup, thus we never really intended for that part of the code base to be used externally. What's in the tutorial is really what we try to support well.\r\n\r\nWith regards to your specific problem I just ran it on my machine and it's working fine. Are you perhaps running \r\n\r\n```\r\npython run_change_detection_pipeline.py\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of just \r\n\r\n```\r\nrun_change_detection_pipeline.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order for the `director` and `PythonQt` imports to work you need to run the scripts using `directorPython` instead of `python`. To give you a simple example of this look at the `run_change_detection.py` script. Notice that at the top it has [`#!/usr/bin/env directorPython\r\n`](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/blob/master/modules/dense_correspondence_manipulation/scripts/run_change_detection.py#L1). Thus on my machine\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun_change_detection.py --data_dir /home/manuelli/data/scratch/2018-04-10-16-05-17/processed\r\n```\r\n\r\nworks just fine while\r\n\r\n```\r\npython run_change_detection.py --data_dir /home/manuelli/data/scratch/2018-04-10-16-05-17/processed\r\n```\r\n\r\nerrors out with\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"run_change_detection.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    import dense_correspondence_manipulation.change_detection.change_detection as change_detection\r\n  File \"/home/manuelli/code/modules/dense_correspondence_manipulation/change_detection/change_detection.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    from director import imageview\r\nImportError: No module named director\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully that should fix your problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/641518926/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/641644224","html_url":"https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/212#issuecomment-641644224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/212","id":641644224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTY0NDIyNA==","user":{"login":"kudo1026","id":16885585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg1NTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16885585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026","html_url":"https://github.com/kudo1026","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kudo1026/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T00:10:10Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T00:10:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the speedy response! \r\nYou are exactly right, I was running\r\n``python run_change_detection_pipeline.py``\r\ninstead of\r\n``run_change_detection_pipeline.py``\r\nI'm sorry I just thought it was a typo in the doc and overlooked it.\r\nAnd it works alright now, thanks for support.
