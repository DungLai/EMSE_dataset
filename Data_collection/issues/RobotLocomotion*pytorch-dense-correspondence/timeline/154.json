If you are familiar with this type of software and have a new-ish GPU, I estimate only would take ~30 minutes to get a model trained and results visualized. Let me know if you get caught up, or we could make anything more clear?\r\n\r\nThank you for your work and open-sourcing it. Would you mind sharing a pretrained model @manuelli @peteflorence ? I try to re-create your `Self-Supervised Correspondence in Visuomotor Policy Learning` paper, which builds on the pre-trained model.\r\n\r\nNvm. I found the model zoo now.
