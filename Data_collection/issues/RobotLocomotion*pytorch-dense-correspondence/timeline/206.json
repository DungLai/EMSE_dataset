I think the error you are seeing is because we use a custom fork of torchvision, not the standard pip version. It is important to follow the steps in the tutorial to ensure that this module gets loaded correctly.\r\n\r\nAs an example showing that `import torchvision.transforms.functional as F` works try the following in a terminal inside your docker container.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmanuelli@paladin-44:~/code$ use_pytorch_dense_correspondence \r\nusing pdc\r\nmanuelli@paladin-44:~/code$ python\r\nPython 2.7.12 (default, Nov 12 2018, 14:36:49) \r\n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import dense_correspondence_manipulation.utils.utils as utils\r\n>>> utils.add_dense_correspondence_to_python_path()\r\n>>> import torchvision\r\n>>> print torchvision.__file__\r\n/home/manuelli/code/external/pytorch-segmentation-detection/vision/torchvision/__init__.pyc\r\n>>> import torchvision.transforms.functional as F\r\n>>> print torchvision.transforms.functions.__file__\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'functions'\r\n>>> print torchvision.transforms.functional.__file__\r\n/home/manuelli/code/external/pytorch-segmentation-detection/vision/torchvision/transforms/functional.pyc\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n Note that `torchvision` points the the submodule of our repo located at `external/pytorch-segmentation-detection/vision/torchvision`. If instead you see `torchvison.__file__` pointing to a system installed copy namely\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> print torchvision.__file__\r\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/torchvision/__init__.pyc\r\n>>> \r\n```\r\n\r\nyou have a problem. My guess is that you have this error because you didn't clone down the submodules of our repo. This should have been completed in Step 3 of the [tutorial](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/blob/master/doc/tutorial_getting_started.md). Hopefully this resolves your issue\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/545920311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/549291056","html_url":"https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/206#issuecomment-549291056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/206","id":549291056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTI5MTA1Ng==","user":{"login":"ozzie00","id":272044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjA0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/272044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00","html_url":"https://github.com/ozzie00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozzie00/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-04T10:17:23Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T10:17:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, Manuelli, \r\n\r\n      we have already cloned the submodules before we had submitted this issue. we will follow your steps to reproduce your resule, thanks.
