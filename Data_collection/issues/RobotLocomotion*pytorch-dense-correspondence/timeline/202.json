The\nlabeling is only provided automatically by multi-view geometry from static\nscenes of a single object at a time. The training procedure is exactly the\nsame as training descriptors for a single object, except the dataset\nincludes multiple instances from the class.\n\nOn Sun, Jul 21, 2019 at 12:25 PM richard2611 <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Heyy, Firstly great work.\n> As there wasnt much info about class consistent descriptors in the paper,I\n> would like to how it's done the training procedure requried for that,ike\n> how correspondences are labelled for training and all.\n> Thankyou in advance.\n>\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/202?email_source=notifications&email_token=ABLBBKBJ7MFZITLCI3GPDJ3QASEY7A5CNFSM4IFS24J2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4HAP2PIA>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABLBBKCVZAULUUBY3KQYJWTQASEY7ANCNFSM4IFS24JQ>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/513572409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"peteflorence","id":5640360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDAzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5640360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence","html_url":"https://github.com/peteflorence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteflorence/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2740790427,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc0MDc5MDQyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/events/2740790427","actor":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-24T13:34:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
