PR #199 just updates the repo to pytorch 1.1. I ran through the entire tutorial from a fresh clone and docker build and didn't encounter any issues. Note that you should run the notebook [`training_tutorial.ipynb`](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/blob/master/dense_correspondence/training/training_tutorial.ipynb), i'm not sure which file you meant by `training.ipynb`.\r\n\r\nHopefully with these updates if you follow the tutorial start again from the beginning you shouldn't encounter any issues. But please let us know if you do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/506070465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/507057081","html_url":"https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/197#issuecomment-507057081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/197","id":507057081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzA1NzA4MQ==","user":{"login":"Amulya21","id":49370470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzcwNDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49370470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21","html_url":"https://github.com/Amulya21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amulya21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-30T18:30:17Z","updated_at":"2019-06-30T18:30:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
