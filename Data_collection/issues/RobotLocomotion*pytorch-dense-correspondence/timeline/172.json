Not a big deal at all! Specifically Step 5 of the tutorial has you run\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse_pytorch_dense_correspondence\r\n```\r\nTry running that command in a terminal, and then launching your jupyter notebook with\r\n\r\n```\r\n./start_notebook.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet us know if that solves the issue for you.\r\n\r\nFYI if you want to know what the command `use_pytorch_dense_correspondence`, it sources [this](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/blob/master/config/setup_environment.sh) file. This ensures that the `dense_correspondence_manipulation` python package is on your `PYTHONPATH`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/428646197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1896070037,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg5NjA3MDAzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/events/1896070037","actor":{"login":"domantasjurkus","id":9018827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTg4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9018827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus","html_url":"https://github.com/domantasjurkus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-10T16:47:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1896070039,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4OTYwNzAwMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/events/1896070039","actor":{"login":"domantasjurkus","id":9018827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTg4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9018827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus","html_url":"https://github.com/domantasjurkus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-10T16:47:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/428865006","html_url":"https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/172#issuecomment-428865006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/172","id":428865006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODg2NTAwNg==","user":{"login":"domantasjurkus","id":9018827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTg4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9018827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus","html_url":"https://github.com/domantasjurkus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domantasjurkus/repos","events_url":"https://api.githu
