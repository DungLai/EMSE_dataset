So it seems like there is some sort of incompatibility between the ply file you generated and the type that VTK can read. I have encountered such issues with PCL's ply writer. But in general this is a VTK compatibilty issue rather than something specific to our repo so I think that googling around the internet is your best bet.\r\n\r\nLet us know what your solution ends up being. Usually it's just the header that is the problem and it's a simple fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/482619003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/483894389","html_url":"https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/191#issuecomment-483894389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/191","id":483894389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4Mzg5NDM4OQ==","user":{"login":"t0mo3","id":41063453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDYzNDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41063453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3","html_url":"https://github.com/t0mo3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mo3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T00:44:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T00:44:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your comment.
