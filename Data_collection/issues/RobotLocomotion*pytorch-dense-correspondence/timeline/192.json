I am on the first notebook, and torchvision is on the proper path as you showed 👍🏻\r\n\r\nNow, I get the following error: ```AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'float32'```.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this is because of a newer torchtext version thats not compatible with our older torch version... I tried with ``` pip install torchtext==0.2.3``` and it's still not working 😕. Any ideas?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/490141161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ademord","id":4501464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDE0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4501464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord","html_url":"https://github.com/Ademord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/490148169","html_url":"https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/192#issuecomment-490148169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/192","id":490148169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDE0ODE2OQ==","user":{"login":"Ademord","id":4501464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDE0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4501464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord","html_url":"https://github.com/Ademord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ademord/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T16:15:49Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T16:17:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Okay, I think I got it.
