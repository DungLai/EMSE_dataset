Yes the pytorch version was pinned to 0.3.0 since that was what was originally used when computing the results for the paper. Updating to pytorch 1.0 is fairly easy (we have done it on a private branch) but we just haven't ported it over to the public repo yet. Hopefully I will open a PR in the next few days with the update. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime feel free to make a PR with your updates. Good suggestion to add a disclaimer, probably the README is the best place for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/496202994/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2369341071,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM2OTM0MTA3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/events/2369341071","actor":{"login":"kingsman142","id":1689017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODkwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1689017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142","html_url":"https://github.com/kingsman142","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T12:52:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2369341072,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNjkzNDEwNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/events/2369341072","actor":{"login":"kingsman142","id":1689017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODkwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1689017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142","html_url":"https://github.com/kingsman142","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingsman142/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T12:52:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/comments/496302782","html_url":"https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/194#issuecomment-496302782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RobotLocomotion/pytorch-dense-correspondence/issues/194","id":496302782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjMwMjc4Mg==","user":{"login":"manuelli","id":5898488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5898488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/manuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"
