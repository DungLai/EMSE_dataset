I think it's likely that the `allennlp` has updated quite a bit since the release of my code. In my experiment, I used `allennlp` version `0.9.0`. I think one way to do that is to install the previous version of AllenNLP and try it to see if it works.\r\n\r\nIt may require a bit of rewriting the code if you would like to use the recent version of AllenNLP. Hope this helps a bit!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/titipata/detecting-scientific-claim/issues/comments/993340022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"titipata","id":8295838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata","html_url":"https://github.com/titipata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titipata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5762642270,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCCMZOs5AVzRjzwAAAAFXevFe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/titipata/detecting-scientific-claim/issues/events/5762642270","actor":{"login":"sny-tong","id":76150360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTUwMzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76150360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong","html_url":"https://github.com/sny-tong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-14T09:24:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5762642273,"node_id":"SE_lADOCCMZOs5AVzRjzwAAAAFXevFh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/titipata/detecting-scientific-claim/issues/events/5762642273","actor":{"login":"sny-tong","id":76150360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTUwMzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76150360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong","html_url":"https://github.com/sny-tong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-14T09:24:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/titipata/detecting-scientific-claim/issues/comments/995369320","html_url":"https://github.com/titipata/detecting-scientific-claim/issues/29#issuecomment-995369320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/titipata/detecting-scientific-claim/issues/29","id":995369320,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCCMZOs47VCFo","user":{"login":"sny-tong","id":76150360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTUwMzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76150360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong","html_url":"https://github.com/sny-tong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sny-tong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-16T01:57:51Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T01:57:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"But
