I think I ran into a weird edge-case wrt not-contraction handling code. If I use the following example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom syntok.tokenizer import Tokenizer\r\n\r\ntok = Tokenizer(replace_not_contraction=False)\r\ntok.split(\"n't\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is `[<Token '' : \"n't\" @ 1>]`. Something is going wrong in the offset calculation there, that 1 should be a 0... The real example this came from is a sentence in the AIDA dataset, `\" Falling share prices in New York do n't hurt Mexico as long as it happens gradually , as earlier this week`.\r\n\r\nI see the same with \"don't\": `[<Token '' : 'do' @ 0>, <Token '' : \"n't\" @ 3>]`, that 3 should be 2 no?\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your thoughts, not sure how to fix this neatly yet.","closed_by":{"login":"fnl","id":109501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTUwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl","html_url":"https://github.com/fnl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
