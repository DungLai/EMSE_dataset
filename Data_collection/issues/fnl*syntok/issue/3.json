It's really great. \r\n\r\nI have been using `segtok` for some time and only today noticed the NB about `syntok`. And just decided to see whether there are any differences between them. For that I downloaded the [Web of Science](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9rw3vkcfy4/6) data sets and generated a diff on the smallest set with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(flair) vagrant@vagrant:~$ /usr/bin/time python -m syntok.segmenter WebOfScience/WOS5736/X.txt >syn.txt\r\n40.80user 0.46system 0:41.49elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 51244maxresident)k\r\n(flair) vagrant@vagrant:~$ /usr/bin/time python -m segtok.segmenter WebOfScience/WOS5736/X.txt >seg.txt\r\n55.01user 0.17system 0:55.40elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 77284maxresident)k\r\ndiff -U 0 seg.txt syn.txt > diff.txt\r\n```\r\nIt turned out, there are lots of differences and not in favor of `syntok`. I thought, you might be interested in looking at the diff. My suspicion is that the issues are rather similar, but one needs to look through the file and extract the specific issues. I put the diff into a [gist](https://gist.github.com/newtover/be2b7862d56de6d731bc4e45c9cf43ac). If I have time, I will try to help with it.
