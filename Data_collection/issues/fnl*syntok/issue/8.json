I don't know what you did, but at least for the data I need to process (mostly news articles), it seems that syntok performs best for sentence splitting. :-) \r\n\r\nI was wondering what would be the most efficient way to get char-based sentence spans. Currently, I got:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspans = []\r\nfor paragraph in segmenter.analyze(text):\r\n        for sent in paragraph:\r\n                spans.append((sent[0].offset, sent[-1].offset + len(sent[-1].value)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think this is most efficient or is there a better way?
