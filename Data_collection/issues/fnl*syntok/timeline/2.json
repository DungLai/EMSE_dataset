That is, all I found were examples of trivial sentence segmentation problems that virtually any statistical tagger can do well on, too. But if someone has a pointer to a really tough test set with stuff like author abbreviations, enumerations, typos, mathematical and scientific content, and/or social domain text (that might be abusing sentence terminal markers), that would be worth adding. Otherwise, I think the 50+ test cases I have collected as examples of such problems are my current \"benchmark\": I haven't found a single other library that can do all those cases.
