But syntok certainly is the future, as it is more efficient, and the tokenization is more consistent, and the API is far less confusing.\r\n\r\nI hope over the next weeks I can make improvements to syntok and add your data as tests to the library and fix the cases; Pls. stay tuned. (Naturally, any PRs that keep the library in the green are equally welcome!)
