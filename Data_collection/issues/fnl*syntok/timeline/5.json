@ZeeshanA1i , first, thank you for your interest in syntok!\r\n\r\nHere comes the good news for your suggestion:\r\nsyntok already supports _exactly_ what you are asking for!\r\n\r\nsyntok sentences are Python lists consisting of [Token](https://github.com/fnl/syntok/blob/5100e7bb1ae5c2b0f4c9bb9b06a8f41d8bc586c3/syntok/tokenizer.py#L6) objects.\r\nAnd those tokens in turn store their absolute offset where they were found in the text.\r\n\r\nLet me show you how you can get nearly the same output today with syntok as you show for SpaCy.\r\nAll you need to do is add the `Token.offset` property of the first token in a sentence to a print statement in your code example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor paragraph in segmenter.analyze(document):\r\n        for sentence in paragraph:\r\n            print(type(sentence))\r\n            for token in sentence:\r\n                # exactly reproduce the input\r\n                # and do not remove \"imperfections\"\r\n                print(token.spacing, token.value, sep='', end='')\r\n            print(\"\\n\", sentence[0].offset, sep='')\r\n```\r\n(Note I also removed the last print statement to make the output _exactly_ equal to that of SpaCy.)\r\n\r\n*Output:*\r\n\r\n> <class 'list'>\r\n> The child who has a rash.\r\n> 0\r\n> <class 'list'>\r\n>  I don't know who has a rash.\r\n> 26\r\n> <class 'list'>\r\n>  The reason why is unknown.\r\n> 55\r\n\r\nWhich, except for the sentence type (list vs. Span) is exactly the same output as you show for SpaCy.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/comments/491380331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fnl","id":109501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTUwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl","html_url":"https://github.com/fnl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2333837588,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMzMzgzNzU4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/events/2333837588","actor":{"login":"zeeshanalipanhwar","id":16404236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar","html_url":"https://github.com/zeeshanalipanhwar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-10T18:05:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2333837589,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMzM4Mzc1ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/events/2333837589","actor":{"login":"zeeshanalipanhwar","id":16404236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDA0MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar","html_url":"https://github.com/zeeshanalipanhwar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeeshanalipanhwar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-10T18:05:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2333837702,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMzMzgzNzcwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/events/2333837702","actor":{"login":"fnl","id":109501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTUwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl","html_url":"https://github.com/fnl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-10T18:05:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2333838347,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMzM4MzgzNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/events/2333838347","actor":{"login":"fnl","id":109501,"n
