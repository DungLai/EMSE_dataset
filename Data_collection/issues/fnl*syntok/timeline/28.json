Yes, dates would be a low-hanging fruit, and handle many cases.

[A-Z][A-Z]+/`\r\nThat immediately surfaces the following cases that indeed are proper sentence terminal usages of this pattern and should be split:\r\n\r\n1.  \"... channel 7. KBS also ...\"\r\n2. \"... and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus ...\"\r\n3. \"... with SSH-1. SSH-2 features ...\"\r\n4. \"... higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 ...\"\r\n\r\nOverall _in English_, with this pattern, I can only find the \"1. FC\" case that should not be split, but more importantly, a number of cases that **should** be split. \r\nThen I tried this pattern on the German Wikipedia, and found the following ordinal expressions that should not be split:\r\n\r\n1. \"1.

just want to mention that I've also stumbled upon that issue.\r\n\r\nI have a concern about \"simple language detection\" algorithm as it can be quite tricky to detect a language. i.e. `langdetect` library doesn't properly work on short sentences. Moreover, there are cases when one language is embedded into another. \r\n\r\nI would prefer to pass a language as a parameter into sentence segmentation as I already know the language of the sentences I want to split.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fnl/syntok/issues/comments/1243744625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zerogerc","id":9149195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDkxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9149195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc","html_url":"https://github.com/zerogerc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zerogerc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
