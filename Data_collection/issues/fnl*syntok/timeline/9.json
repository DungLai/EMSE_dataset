Wikipedia): \"The semicolon or semi-colon[1] (;) is a punctuation mark that separates major sentence elements.

Therefore I would tend not to expect it to split on a colon and would prefer that was left to people to deal with if there are special cases with their particular text source.\r\n\r\nHowever, with a semi-colon I would be more open to the idea that they can be treated as separate sentences.
