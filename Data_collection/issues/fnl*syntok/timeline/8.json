Felix, thank you for you kind words, glad you like syntok.\r\n\r\nWell, semantically, there is no easier way to get to these offsets, because they depend on all the methods you called there, plus the length of the last token.\r\nBut if you want to submit a function that wraps the above functionality in a simple API, such as a `offsets` function in the `segmenter` module, I'd be happy to accept a clean PR, if you think that is useful, that is, probably an API like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef offset_iterator(text: str) -> Iterator[(Int, Int)]:\r\n    for paragraph in analyze(text):\r\n        for sent in paragraph:\r\n            yield sent[0].offset, sent[-1].offset + len(sent[-1].value)\r\n\r\ndef offsets(text: str) -> List[(Int, Int)]:\r\n    return list(offset_iterator(text))\r\n```\r\nIt would have at least one other user, see issue #5 , too!
