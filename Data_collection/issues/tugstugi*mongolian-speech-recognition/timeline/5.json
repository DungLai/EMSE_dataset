' ' is the normal white space. 'B' is the so called 'blank' character used in the CTC loss. You can replace it with any character as long as it doesn't belong to your alphabet of your language and it is the first character  of the 'vocab' variable (both the native PyTorch CTC loss and the warp CTC loss assumes the index of the blank character is 0 that is why it must be the first character).\r\n\r\n2. I have implemented [arXiv:1712.09444](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09444) and they use only 1-d convolutions. But I think 2D conv will work also, at least for speech commands it works: https://github.com/tugstugi/pytorch-speech-commands","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tugstugi/mongolian-speech-recognition/issues/comments/485276293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tugstugi","id":243826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzgyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/243826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi","html_url":"https://github.com/tugstugi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2290265225,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI5MDI2NTIyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tugstugi/mongolian-speech-recognition/issues/events/2290265225","actor":{"login":"tugstugi","id":243826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzgyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/243826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi","html_url":"https://github.com/tugstugi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tugstugi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-21T19:26:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
