The backend process shows `KeyError: 'i'` and the traceback ends with that same line (124 in model.py).\r\n\r\nPresumably the missing parameter should trigger the `MissingInputError` exception instead of throwing `KeyError`? From a design perspective, I'm not sure based on the documentation whether or not the default value will be used when the parameter is missing from the request, or if I should supply (e.g.) `null` as the value in the JSON when I specifically want to use the model's default value for that parameter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/comments/499669293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aparrish","id":125839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTgzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish","html_url":"https://github.com/aparrish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"agermanidis","id":600956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDk1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/600956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis","html_url":"https://github.com/agermanidis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agermanidis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-07T21:35:38Z","updated_at":"2019-06-07T21:35:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/67","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/67/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/67/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/67/events","html_url":"https://github.com/runwayml/model-sdk/pull/67","id":453702895,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg2MzQwNjM0","number":67,"title":"Fix
