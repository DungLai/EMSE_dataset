for https://github.com/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/9.\r\n\r\nThis approach removes the argument parser for defining runtime parameters via a CLI interface and replaces it with the ability to define default runtime arguments via keyword arguments to the `runway.run()` function.\r\n\r\nThe values for all five keyword arguments `host`, `port`, `model_options`, `debug`, and `meta` can be overwritten at runtime by their respective environment variables `RW_HOST`, `RW_PORT`, `RW_MODEL_OPTIONS`, `RW_DEBUG`, `RW_META`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/comments/481859415","html_url":"https://github.com/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/9#issuecomment-481859415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/9","id":481859415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTg1OTQxNQ==","user":{"login":"brannondorsey","id":3193533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTM1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey","html_url":"https://github.com/brannondorsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T20:48:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T20:48:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed
