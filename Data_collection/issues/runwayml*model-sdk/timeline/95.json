there 👋,\r\n\r\nI think I'm able to reproduce this issue (or at least something that looks just like it) on Ubuntu 18.04 by setting my resolution settings to a lower resolution than the full resolution supported by my monitor in Display settings. My 4K monitor is 3840x2160 (16:9) natively, and everything looks fine when its set at that resolution. But if I change the resolution to 2560x1440 (still 16:9) my Runway app overflows off the screen similarly to what you describe.\r\n\r\nCan you check if your resolution is set to the maximum in Display settings?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/comments/625326390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brannondorsey","id":3193533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTM1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey","html_url":"https://github.com/brannondorsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/comments/625380925","html_url":"https://github.com/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/95#issuecomment-625380925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/95","id":625380925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTM4MDkyNQ==","user":{"login":"JonathanLoscalzo","id":6944598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDQ1OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6944598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo","html_url":"https://github.com/JonathanLoscalzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanLoscalzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T17:06:22Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T17:06:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @brannondorsey \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6944598/81322926-0780bf80-906b-11ea-8386-6aa68b472335.png)\r\n\r\nYes, is set to max resolution. \r\n\r\n> But if I change the resolution to 2560x1440 (still 16:9) my Runway app overflows off the screen similarly to what you describe.\r\n\r\nI don't think that it overflows from the screen, because if I press \"alt+tab\", it doesn't appear in this carrousel. \r\n\r\nOr I think...
