Now that dictionaries are required to define these arguments to `@runway.setup()` and `@runway.command()`, the name parameter is not needed, as the name of the key in these dictionaries should be used instead. Preserving the `name` parameter in the `data_type` constructor will lead to confusion if it's never actually used.","closed_by":{"login":"brannondorsey","id":3193533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTM1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey","html_url":"https://github.com/brannondorsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brannondorsey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/runwayml/model-sdk/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
