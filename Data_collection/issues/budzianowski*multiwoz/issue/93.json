But, it was implemented in Python 2 that is depreciated. I refactored this part and dependent codes for being compatible in Python 3 once for my research project that I think can help others. I want to ask may I push them and make a pull request?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"jianguoz","id":16167539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY3NTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16167539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz","html_url":"https://github.com/jianguoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianguoz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/budzianowski/multiwoz/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/budzianowski/multiwoz/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
