I simply replaced the dataset used by [trade](https://github.com/jasonwu0731/trade-dst), which experiments on MultiWOZ 2.0,  with the hyperparameters unchange., However, this only reached an accuracy of 35% approximately. This result is much lower than the result this paper reported, which I guess it may be an issue of hyperparameters of the trade model.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not able to find any reference related to this, I even have no idea if the hyperparameters of trade, or other models, change between these two datasets. I wonder if it is possible for me to get the specific values of these hyperparamters of models on MultiWOZ 2.1, so I could reproduce the result? Thanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"budzianowski","id":17451096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDUxMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17451096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski","html_url":"https://github.com/budzianowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budzianowski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/budzianowski/multiwoz/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/budzianowski/multiwoz/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
