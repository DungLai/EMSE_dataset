We take the first element because in the dialogue setting, we put triplets format, (subject, predicate, object), in the memory. Therefore we will need to indicate the index. However, in the MT setting, it is just a plain string array so no need to take [0] in this case. Sorry for the misleading. \r\n\r\nOne last thing, copy mechanism might not be that helpful in MT case because the input and output are not in the same language (different vocabulary). So directly use Mem2Seq in MT problems will not give you promising results.
