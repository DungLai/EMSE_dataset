Indeed we use CrossEntropyLoss which already has Softmax inside. Notice that prob_lg is the last hop logit and the softmax is just a normalization needed for the loss. Indeed when we greedy decode we do not need to use softmax. \r\n\r\nI hope this help, let me know if you have any other doubt.\r\n\r\nBest
