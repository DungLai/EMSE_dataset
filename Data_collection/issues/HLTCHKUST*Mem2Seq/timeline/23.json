Some seem to be the standard KB triplet ravenswood_shopping_center distance 6_miles whereas other seem to be longer like 4_miles heavy_traffic coffee_or_tea_place poi philz?\r\nyes, Poi and Weather need different info in the tuple. For sure there is a better way to do this, but the main points here is to have all the tokens you need in your response in the same line separated by space. So the model can copy such independent token.\r\n- Also are there are any other preprocessing subtleties I should be aware of?\r\nIn MWOZ there are many actually. I converted MWOZ to an end-to-end dataset already. In my view, It is very challenging for many reasons, If you are interested maybe we could have a chat, in case contact me by email (amadotto@connect.ust.hk). I am very happy to help. :)  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HLTCHKUST/Mem2Seq/issues/comments/508835272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andreamad8","id":6934703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6934703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8","html_url":"https://github.com/andreamad8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2463349264,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ2MzM0OTI2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HLTCHKUST/Mem2Seq/issues/events/2463349264","actor":{"login":"andreamad8","id":6934703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6934703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8","html_url":"https://github.com/andreamad8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-05T18:33:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
