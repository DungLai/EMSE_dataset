First of all I'm assuming that `read_entities.py` is what is producing the train.txt, test.txt etc for the KVR dataset. So the goal of preprocessing seems to be to get them all into the format `0 2_miles road_block_nearby parking_garage poi dish_parking`. So I assume the 0 means that they are a KB entry correct? Then the 1, 2,3 are for the actual dialogue turns.  Also for the KB entries how do you decide how many items to have? Some seem to be the standard KB triplet `ravenswood_shopping_center distance 6_miles` whereas other seem to be longer like `4_miles heavy_traffic coffee_or_tea_place poi philz`? What is the criteria for determining that? Also are there are any other preprocessing subtleties I should be aware of?\r\n\r\n Thanks. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"andreamad8","id":6934703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6934703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8","html_url":"https://github.com/andreamad8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreamad8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HLTCHKUST/Mem2Seq/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HLTCHKUST/Mem2Seq/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
