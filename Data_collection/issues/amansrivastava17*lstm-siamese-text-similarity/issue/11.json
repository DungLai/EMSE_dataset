I have two questions: \r\n\r\n1- I understand that \"leaks features\" are like common characters between sentences in each pair or something like this? I I'm trying to train the model with vector similarity directly instead of sentence similarity, do you guess I can remove the leaks part from the model?\r\n\r\n2- How is the accuracy measured? I guess that the sigmoid is outputting a number between 0 and 1, so how is the accuracy measured, considering 1 if the value is >0.5 and 0 else?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amansrivastava17/lstm-siamese-text-similarity/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amansrivastava17/lstm-siamese-text-similarity/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
