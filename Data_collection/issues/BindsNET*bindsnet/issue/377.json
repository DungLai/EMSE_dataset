I see the implementation of `CurrentLIFNodes`, which I assume is what I am looking for. However I am now confused by the trace parameters in the Node class (which I initially thought controlled this behaviour). Could someone please elaborate on the following parameters.\r\n```\r\n        :param traces: Whether to record decaying spike traces.\r\n        :param traces_additive: Whether to record spike traces additively.\r\n        :param tc_trace: Time constant of spike trace decay.\r\n        :param trace_scale: Scaling factor for spike trace.\r\n        :param sum_input: Whether to sum all inputs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
