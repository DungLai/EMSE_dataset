As I understand, this is because sparse tensors and dense tensors behave differently in terms of code.\r\nSo that’s probably quite a lot of work. Can this be done by any chance, please?\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to have sparse spikes. For example, inhibitor connections spikes that I’m working with now have sparsity around 0.002.\r\nI’m sure that changing the type of these spikes to torch.sparse would make a huge boost in performance.\r\nAs I understand, currently PyTorch has no native way of multiplying two sparse tensors. So it’s just a suggestion for future.\r\n\r\nIt’s my first GitHub post, so feel free to tell me if I’m doing something wrong.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
