Hope you're doing well.\r\n\r\nI just noticed while trying to run the conv_mnist and eth_mnist examples that --plot seems to break things.\r\n\r\nThe error is:\r\nOMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized.\r\nOMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.
