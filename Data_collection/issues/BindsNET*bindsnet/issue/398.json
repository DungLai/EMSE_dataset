So far nothing weird, when running with seed = 0, i.e. the execution being deterministic.\r\nHowever, when I change only the number of `neurons n_neurons`, this sequence of labels changes.\r\nE.g. when running with the parameter configuration `--n_clamp 0 --intensity 170 --inh 60 --n_neurons X --n_train 1000 --n_test 0 --time 40 --update_interval 50`\r\nfor \r\n\r\n- X = 80 I would get the sequence of labels 3, 7, 6, 2, 7, 1, 9, 0, 5, 7, 5, 1, ...\r\n\r\n- X = 100 I would get 0, 4, 1, 8, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 7, 0, 7, ...\r\n\r\n- X = 120 I would get 9, 1, 7, 9, 7, 8, 0, 9, 0, 3, 4, 9, ...\r\n\r\netc. \r\nThis does not make any sense to me as, in my understanding, `n_neurons` is neither used in loading or preparing the dataset, nor in choosing images from it, nor is it used as a random seed or the like. \r\nDoes anyone have an idea why this could be happening? (And if not: Might this be an issue inherent to PyTorch?) \r\nI would greatly appreciate an answer :).\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nP.S. I made sure to use the newest version of BindsNET when trying this out","closed_by":{"login":"Danielle-Schuman","id":52699523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjk5NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52699523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman","html_url":"https://github.com/Danielle-Schuman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
