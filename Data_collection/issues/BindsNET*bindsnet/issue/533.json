As I understand, it is intended to approximate the differential equation with the improved euler method:\r\n\r\nv_(k+1) = v_k + h * f(t_(k + 0.5 * h), v_(k+0.5)) with\r\nv_(k+0.5) = v_k + 0.5 * h * f(t_k, v_k)\r\n\r\nThe code below (taken from the Izihkevich neuron) doesn't implement the above mentioned procedure and produces an incorrect approximation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nself.v += self.dt * 0.5 * (0.04 * self.v ** 2 + 5 * self.v + 140 - self.u + x)\r\nself.v += self.dt * 0.5 * (0.04 * self.v ** 2 + 5 * self.v + 140 - self.u + x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nv_half = self.v + self.dt * 0.5 * (0.04 * self.v ** 2 + 5 * self.v + 140 - self.u + x)\r\nself.v += self.dt * (0.04 * v_half ** 2 + 5 * v_half + 140 - self.u + x) \r\n```\r\nThe problem in the original equations is that the second equation does self.v += ... in which the self.v is not v_k anymore but v_(k+0.5) and the step size is not adjusted to the full step size which leads to the aforementioned error.\r\n\r\nSorry if I misunderstood the equations and what I am writing is wrong.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nP","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/533/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
