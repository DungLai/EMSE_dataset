I really appreciate the intention and approach of this project. And I hope I could contribute something.\r\n\r\nMaybe this problem would be more proper to be handled by pull request or something. But I'm not really used to github's contributing process or something. Please tell me if I'm doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nHere's the thing. I looked inside the MSTDPET learning rule and I found its implementation is different from Florian's original learning rule. Current implementation is as follows. \r\n`        self.p_plus = -(self.tc_plus * self.p_plus) + a_plus * source_x`\r\n`        self.p_minus = -(self.tc_minus * self.p_minus) + a_minus * target_x`\r\n\r\nHowever, in Florian's paper, it's described as \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24662250/46744984-25e3d500-cce7-11e8-8dbb-d5e3ba5e5ad1.png)\r\nor \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24662250/46745054-490e8480-cce7-11e8-87b7-8edb6b93b8b3.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe someone who implemented it was confused between dP/dt and just P.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
