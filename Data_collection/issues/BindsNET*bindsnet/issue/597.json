The setup they use is quite simple but I think a bit tricky to implement in BindsNET: \r\nThere are 1000 neurons connected all-to-all. I inject a strong current impulse to the first 50 of them, and let the network run for some time.\r\nI created the all-to-all network in this way\r\n```\r\nnetwork = Network(dt=1.0)\r\nall_net = LIFNodes(n=network.num_neurons, refrac=0, traces=True, tresh=-60)\r\nall_to_all_conn = Connection(source=all_net , target=net, w=None, wmin=-1, wmax=1, update_rule=network.update_rule, network=network)\r\n    network.add_layer(net, name='N')\r\n    network.add_connection(all_to_all_conn, source='N', target='N')\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, I am having trouble understanding what's the best way to make a set of neurons spike on commands. I think using an `InputNode` would not be appropriate, as that's basically a whole new layer that has its own weight and anyway applying a spike to the InputNode won't guarantee the correct neurons to spike. \r\nAnother way could be to use the `inject_v` parameter and inject enough voltage to make them spike. Is this the best way to do this?","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
