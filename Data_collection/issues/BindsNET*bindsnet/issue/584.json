I was able to save and load the model as per the usual way using PyTorch, but the 'forward' function does not seem to work if I use the DiehlAndCook2015 model.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67228311/190679562-4fe994e9-975c-46a8-b7b7-bc4d7152c524.png)\r\n\r\nCould you advise on how to do inference on the images I am passing in after loading back the model?
