But thanks for the answers, it was really helpful.\r\nNow, I'd like to ask other thing. I tried to run cifar-10 on GPU, but I got this error.\r\n\r\n> $ python cifar10_env.py --gpu\r\n> Begin training.\r\n> \r\n> Progress: 0 / 50000 (0.0000 seconds)\r\n> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n>   File \"cifar10_env.py\", line 137, in <module>\r\n>     pipeline.step()\r\n>   File \".../bindsnet/bindsnet/pipeline/__init__.py\", line 184, in step\r\n>     self.encoded[inpt] = self.encoding(self.obs, time=self.time, dt=self.network.dt, **kwargs)\r\n>   File \".../bindsnet/bindsnet/encoding/__init__.py\", line 127, in poisson\r\n>     rate[datum != 0] = 1 / datum[datum != 0] * (1000 / dt)\r\n> RuntimeError: expected type torch.cuda.FloatTensor but got torch.FloatTensor\r\n\r\nI think it is a simple problem but since I'm still new to python, could you please help me to solve this fast.
