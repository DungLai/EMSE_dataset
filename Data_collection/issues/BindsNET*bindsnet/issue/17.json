As @djsaunde has mentioned before, it'd be better to have it use `plt.plot()` but this brings up a couple of problems if we need to plot voltages and such since they use colormap. So, for example if we are trying to plot voltages of neurons throughout the simulation, how do we want this visualized? It was simple to do it using `plt.matshow()` but since we are trying to avoid using that for this function, it makes things a bit tricky.\r\n\r\nAlso, are we interested in something that plots traces for us? I don't believe there is anything that showcases that and I'd say it might be useful, especially when we are looking to introduce more relevancy of time into our tests.
