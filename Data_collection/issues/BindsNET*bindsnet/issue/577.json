The bug is in `select_softmax`, used in e.g. `breakout_stdp.py`\r\nDuring the first iteration (time=0), `pipeline.spike_record[output]` has a `shape` os `[100, 4]` , `spike` is `tensor([0., 0., 0., 0.])`, so softmax is `tensor([0.25, 0.,25, 0.25, 0.25])` and it's all good.\r\n\r\nHowever at any other timestep the dimension of `pipeline.spike_record[output]` has a shape of `tensor([100, 1, 4])`, `spike` is something like `tensor([[17., 17., 17., 17.])` which mean that `torch.softmax(spikes, dim=0)` is computing the softmax _on the wrong dimension_, and the result is always `probabilities = tensor([[1., 1., 1., 1.]])`, **meaning that the agent will always perform a random action.**\r\n\r\nI am happy to fix this. In the meantime, I think it's good to share it as some people might get confused.\r\nThis issue is not impacting other examples such as `eth_minst.py`, that's why this net can learn supervised.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
