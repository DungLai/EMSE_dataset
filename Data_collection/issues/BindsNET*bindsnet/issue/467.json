I am trying to train a very small feed forward network much alike your example with MNIST with the dataset replaced by Google Speech Commands (GSCD), but I can't seem to make the network learn anything (see `train.py`). My source code is available [here](https://github.com/hansemandse/KWSonSNN/tree/master/netwkdev). \r\n\r\nThe network I am using is a scaled version of the `DiehlAndCook2015` network (see `kwsonsnn/model.py`) made to fit on a custom hardware accelerator. It works with MNIST achieving roughly 70% accuracy in a single epoch. I believe my dataset (see `kwsonsnn/dataset.py`) is correctly preprocessed in a style similar to your implementation of Spoken MNIST. The regular PyTorch model included in the repo (see `trainpt.py`) achieves 90% accuracy on GSCD indicating that data is not to blame.\r\n\r\nI have tried multiple different parameter configurations in terms of weight normalization and learning rates, but they do not seem to improve the network's performance.\r\n\r\nSo, am I doing something wrong? And do you by any chance have some benchmark results for either Spoken MNIST or GSCD produced with BindsNET?\r\n\r\nSystem specifications:\r\n- Python3 3.7.6\r\n- BindsNET 0.2.7\r\n- numpy 1.18.1\r\n- PyTorch 1.6.0+cpu","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
