The error I encountered was difference of number of timesteps between encoded input's and network. Since encoded input's number of timesteps is `time` while network's number of timesteps is `time/dt`. I was thinking about resolving this issue, but I found that it requires redesigning almost every encoding functions. Any idea about this? Or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThank you.
