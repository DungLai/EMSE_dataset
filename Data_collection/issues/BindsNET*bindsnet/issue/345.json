Running the script, I get the results:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEpisode 95 total reward:1.0\r\nEpisode 96 total reward:0.0\r\nEpisode 97 total reward:2.0\r\nEpisode 98 total reward:1.0\r\nEpisode 99 total reward:4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this to be expected? What's the mean/variance of the reward values I should be expecting? I'm looking to get something working so I can establish some baselines.
