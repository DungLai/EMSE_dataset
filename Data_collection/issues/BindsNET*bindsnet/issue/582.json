Maybe it's just about finding the right hyperparameters?\r\n\r\nI have also tried another gym task (the cart pole) but haven't been successful with it either. To get the input spikes I convert the observation values into [0, 1] values and pass them into the bernoulli encoding. Still doesn't work. Any idea would be _really_ appreciated.
