Minibatching in spiking neural networks is inherently more complicated because spiking neurons maintain state (voltages, spikes traces, etc.).\r\n\r\nWe may be able to implement mini-batching by duplicating neurons at the start of each simulation, processing minibatches of data independently in parallel, and aggregating the results of each independent simulation to make, e.g., weight updates. The process would work something like this:\r\n\r\n1. When calling `network.run`, users will pass in data of shape `[batch_size, time, k_1, ..., k_n]` (matching the WIP PR #243).\r\n2. Neurons' state variables will be duplicated along the batch dimension `batch_size` times; when `batch_size = 1`, this reduces to our current implementation.\r\n3. Simulation proceeds as normal, but updates to neuron state variables occur independently across the batch dimension. Updates to weights occur in parallel.","closed_by":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
