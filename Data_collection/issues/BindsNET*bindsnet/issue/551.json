When I trained the model on my data for lots of iterations, I noticed that my GPU memory was getting fully utilized until the code crashed. I pinpoint where the problem is coming from and that was \r\n`self.v += (self.refrac_count <= 0).float() * x` part of the code in the forward pass of `DiehlAndCookNodes` class. I also tested the code with the `BoostedLIFNodes` class, and the same problem showed up in the line `self.v += x`. \r\n\r\nAfter a bit of research, I found that the problem is due to the fact that PyTorch is normally storing the gradients for this type of operation, which I believe is not required in Bindsnet for unsupervised learning (Please correct me if I'm wrong). What fixed the issue for me was just adding the `with torch.no_grad():` before the actual operation.\r\n\r\nI suggest adding it to the code base so this problem won't happen in the future for others.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
