I've generated the ubyte and the .gz archives with MNIST format 56x28 pixels images. \r\n\r\nFirst with the raw folder empty I ran the code with download = True, when the download of the training_dataset and the test_dataset is completed the MNIST 28x28 pixel archives appeared and the network runs using them. Then when it's over, I delete these files and paste my 56x28 archives in the raw folder and ran the code again with download = False (and obviously changing the dimensions of the input to fit the 56 height)\r\n\r\nhere in line 157 : \r\ntrain_dataset = MNIST(\r\n    # The encoding applied to the input data.\r\n    PoissonEncoder(time=time, dt=dt),\r\n    None,\r\n    # Folder where the dataset files are stored.\r\n    root=\"./data\",\r\n    # Wheter to download the dataset (the download page usually fails, so using a local copy is recommended).\r\n    download=True, #False after first download <-------------------------------------\r\n    # Wheter to use train or test files.\r\n    train=True,\r\n    # The transformation applied to the encoded input data.\r\n    transform=transforms.Compose(\r\n        [transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Lambda(lambda x: x * intensity)]\r\n    ),\r\n)\r\n\r\nBut the .pt archives do not appear in the processed folder which keeps being empty after the running is complete.
