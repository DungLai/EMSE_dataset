We set the firing threshold of a neuron to be infinity, which wonâ€™t fire at all, and we adopt the final membrane potential to represent Q function. It is convenient to implement such neurons in the SpikingJelly framework: just inherit everything from LIF neuron neuron.LIFNode and rewrite its forward function.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass NonSpikingLIFNode(neuron.LIFNode):\r\n    def forward(self, dv: torch.Tensor):\r\n        self.neuronal_charge(dv)\r\n        # self.neuronal_fire()\r\n        # self.neuronal_reset()\r\n        return self.v\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now I need to use BindsNET to do the same thing. How could I make the LIFNodes to be non-spiking?\r\nThank you so much!","closed_by":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
