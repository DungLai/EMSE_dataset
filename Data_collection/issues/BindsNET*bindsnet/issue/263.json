Could you plesae let me know what they represent?\r\nBecause it is important to understand the following parts: `torch.ger(source_s, target_x)` and `torch.ger(source_x, target_s)`.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
