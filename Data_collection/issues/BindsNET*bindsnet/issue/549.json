So I re-installed Bindsnet again, although during install I noticed Bindsnet uninstalled the newest version of torch and installed an older version. \r\n\r\nSo now when I run:\r\n\r\n`torch.cuda.is_available()`\r\nI get:\r\n`False`\r\n\r\nI don't know how anyone else can get Bindsnet to run on their GPU with Cuda. I tried older versions of Cuda and it would not work.\r\n\r\nI feel a simple solution would be to update the install with the newest version of PyTorch.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
