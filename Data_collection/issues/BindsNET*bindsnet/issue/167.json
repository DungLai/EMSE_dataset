Therefore I'm suggesting introducing new class called `Agent` which contains `network`, `encoding`, and `action_function` and maybe more. I think this would help us lot on organizing codes based on concrete conceptual model. \r\n\r\nFor example, related to we discussed in #151, `action_function` and `network` should share the same `dt`.  Until now, this should have been synchronized manually. If we introduce `Agent` class, this issue is resolve naturally by sharing the `Agent`'s `dt` value. \r\n\r\nActually I'm already working on it, and I expect it can be done without any serious additional coding. But it requires some changes in other modules. For example, most of the code in `Pipeline`'s `step()` function would moved into `Agent`'s `step()` function. And implementation of action function should also be changed a little.\r\n\r\nI want to hear your opinion on this idea. Do you think introducing `Agent` class fits well with the purpose of BindsNET?
