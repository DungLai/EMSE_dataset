I am trying to use BindsNET but I find that the documentation is practically non-existent. There is a pdf file with some initial\r\nsetup but apart from that nothing else. Moreover the code that exists in the paper \r\n\r\n\"BindsNET: A machine learning-oriented spiking neural networks library in Python\"\r\n\r\nproduces mistakes when I try to run it and thus it is not helpful. On top of that this code doesn't even exist in any source which you can copy and paste and thus one has to write it from the start.
