@djsaunde Has there been any movement on this? If not it is something I can crank out rev 1 of this week. I will probably first look into subclassing `torch.nn.Module` as it would provide the most functionality for the least work. Some benefits to exploit out of the box:\r\n\r\n1) `.to(device)` will allow for management of devices directly\r\n2) saving of Networks and `torch.nn.Module`s together (e.g. a reservoir type setup as in `examples/mnist/minimal_reservoir.py`)\r\n3) this enable the use of the full pytorch data loading pipeline with `pin_memory` enabled which provides asynchronous transfer to the
