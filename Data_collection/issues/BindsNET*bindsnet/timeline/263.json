I'm using the `master` branch of BindsNET right now, and I'm getting a different error on the `diehl_and_cook_2015.py` script.\r\n\r\nFrom the stack trace:\r\n\r\n> print('\\t%s: %.2f' % (scheme, float(np.mean(curves[scheme]))))\r\n\r\nit looks like `curves[scheme]` is a `torch.Tensor` object, whereas `np.mean(...)` expects a `np.ndarray`. So, the fix should be to cast `curves[scheme]` to a `numpy` array, or to use `torch.mean(...)` instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/497723354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2381126196,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4MTEyNjE5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2381126196","actor":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-31T14:12:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2381126199,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODExMjYxOTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2381126199","actor":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-31T14:12:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/497744206","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/263#issuecomment-497744206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/263","id":497744206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Nzc0NDIwNg==","user":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-31T15:08:56Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T15:08:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh

think these scripts `self.source.s.any()` or `self.target.s.any()` are what I'm looking for.\r\nBecause I was trying to find a function that can inform me whenever the spikes happen.\r\nI'll try them out and close the issue at the moment.
