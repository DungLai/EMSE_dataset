So if I understand correctly, when Network.run() is called, then for the Tth time step:\r\n\r\n1) current_input[L] are the inputs computed to the units at the layer L (This applies to the layer corresponding to any node classes). (Here: https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/blob/master/bindsnet/network/network.py#L343) \r\n2) input[L][T] are the spike inputs (corresponding to the Tth time step) to the units at the Input layer L. (This applies to the layer corresponding to the Input node class only). \r\n\r\nNow if we consider an Input layer L1 with an input spike vector of only zeros, i.e no spiking activity, at time say T1,\r\nthen since\r\n \r\n```\r\ncurrent_input[L1] = current_input[L1] + input[L1][T1]\r\n```\r\n(See: https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/blob/master/bindsnet/network/network.py#L349)\r\n\r\nand `input[L1][T1]` is a vector of zeros, then we get the same current_input[L1] as time T1 - 1 which may be non-zero.\r\n\r\nSo my confusion stems from the fact that it is this non-zero current_input[L1] vector that seems to be forward propagated (multiplied by weights as you mentioned) to the next layer and yield a non zero PSC, in contrast to getting zero as you mentioned. See: https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/blob/master/bindsnet/network/network.py#L358.\r\n\r\nNote: I am only talking about the layers of Input Class.\r\n\r\nSorry if I am missing something trivial and sounding redundant.
