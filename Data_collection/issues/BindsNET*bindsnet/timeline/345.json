The code `breakout_stdp.py` demonstrates how to use a spiking network to play an ATARI game. \r\nThe results that you reported are normal and can be expected from a random choice of the untrained spiking network.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is not an easy task for training spiking neurons to perform well in the RL environment. \r\nHowever, in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608019302266), we show a way to train regular neuronal network and convert it to the spiking network. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/559798072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2841516576,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg0MTUxNjU3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2841516576","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-29T13:57:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
