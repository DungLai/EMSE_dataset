You are right, there was a couple of issues with the example that prevent it to work under GPU. \r\nThe data loader has been fixed. \r\n\r\nThe accuracy reported in the example is for the training process. It shows that the network reacts as expected. Once the training completes the supervise mechanism that clamps the right neuron and forces it to fire no longer valid. \r\nThus in your code, the measurement accuracy is correct for the testing part, where there is no guidance from the supervisor. Feel free to adjust the network parameters (nu, theta_plus, etc) to achieve better accuracy. It's there, you just need to find it. \r\n\r\nAbout the plots, they indeed need to be improved, feel free to push a  PR, it will be gladly appreciated. \r\n\r\nNote that in your code you use 'i' twice, in the outer loop, and the inside loop.
