I can only try to help. I will start by upgrading BindsNET to 0.2.8 (instruction in the main repo page).\r\nThen, please add some plots: weights, voltage curves of the neurons, spikes of #neuron vs time, and input reconstruction. Hopefully the plots will show you how to approach the parameter tuning task.\r\n\r\nA brief glimpse on your code, I think that your normalization value is too high. Note that the normalization value choosen by `DiehlAndCook2015` was 10% of the input neurons, that also reflect the B/W pixel ratio in MNIST.\r\n\r\n I couldn't spot an error \r\n\r\n\r\n>  do you by any chance have some benchmark results for either Spoken MNIST or GSCD produced with BindsNET?\r\n\r\nSadly, no, but If you run them, I will be happy to add them to the repo with your name as a contributor.
