Technically, this is not an issue, though, because the plots from plotting.py are not intended to be there after training, but for you to watch during training. For saving plots after training, there is the code in visualization.py. However, not all plots you can find in plotting.py are also in visualization.py. Since I also wanted to save the plots from plotting.py to look at after training, I modified the code the following way:\r\nI wrote the following function into plotting.py:\r\n```\r\ndef save_plot(\r\n    fig: Figure,\r\n    directory: str,\r\n    name: str,\r\n    n: int\r\n):\r\n    file = directory + '/' + name + str(n)\r\n    fig.savefig(file)\r\n```\r\nwhich saves the figures to a specified directory, and then modified the plotting methods, making them return figures, e.g. for spikes and weights that would be:\r\n```\r\ndef plot_spikes(\r\n    spikes: Dict[str, torch.Tensor],\r\n    time: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] = None,\r\n    n_neurons: Optional[Dict[str, Tuple[int, int]]] = None,\r\n    ims: Optional[List[PathCollection]] = None,\r\n    axes: Optional[Union[Axes, List[Axes]]] = None,\r\n    figsize: Tuple[float, float] = (8.0, 4.5),\r\n    fig: Figure = None\r\n) -> Tuple[List[AxesImage], List[Axes], Figure]:\r\n    # language=rst\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Plot spikes for any group(s) of neurons.\r\n\r\n    :param spikes: Mapping from layer names to spiking data.

I'm not one of the scientists developing the BindsNET library, this is just \"peer-to-peer\" help
