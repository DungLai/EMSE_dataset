As in, you should be able to throw it `dict` of spikes and it should work all the same. I don't currently have the time to look at it therefore if you have time, you could revert `plotting.py` to the commit where it was the older function. I had a commit that removed the old function therefore the one before that will have the older function untouched because I worked by creating `plot_spikes_new` - a copy of `plot_spikes`. \r\n\r\nI agree about the length but a major part of it basically checking if the inputs were valid or not. We could potentially remove a lot of the assertions if we want to assume that the user will provide us with valid inputs altogether.

The problem is, the function by default interprets the first argument as a `Network` object, and the second as a `Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, unless you explicitly pass `network=network` or `spikes=spikes` (with the correct types). Perhaps we could just have the first argument be `Union[Network, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]` (`Union` is the logical OR function of [types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)), and remove the second argument, and the type of the first argument can be checked in the function.\r\n\r\nI'd argue that checking if the inputs are valid or not aren't really a top priority, and I think it's good Python programming, especially if the errors which result by default are informative. Since we mostly build on top of mature Python libraries, the errors that come out of `torch` and `matplotlib` should mostly be enough to help the user debug their programs.
