I didnt got the error above. Can you please provide a code that I can replicate the error.\r\n\r\nThank you for trying to run my code.\r\n\r\nI run my code by calling `agent.learn()`, and `model_path = os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, f\"{args.model}_{args.env_id}_{time_str}.pkl\"))` is an arguments to `agent.learn()`.\r\n\r\nActually, I call `agent.learn()` as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmain_net = DSQN_RSTDP(args.history_len, action_num, args.learning_rate, device, args.time, args.dt)\r\ntarget_net = DSQN_RSTDP(args.history_len, action_num, args.learning_rate, device, args.time, args.dt)\r\nagent = DSQN_RSTDP_Agent(eval_env, main_net, writer, train_env, target_net, replay_memory)\r\nagent.learn(args.timestep_num, args.replay_start_size, args.minibatch_size, args.discount_factor, args.update_freq, args.target_net_update_freq, args.eval_freq, args.eval_episode_num, args.eval_epsilon, args.init_epsilon, args.final_epsilon, args.final_epsilon_frame, model_path = os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, f\"{args.model}_{args.env_id}_{time_str}.pkl\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen inside the `agent.learn()` is the normal DQN run flow, as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def learn(self, timestep_num, replay_start_size, minibatch_size, discount_factor, update_freq, target_net_update_freq,\r\n                eval_freq, eval_episode_num, eval_epsilon, init_epsilon, final_epsilon, final_epsilon_frame, model_path):\r\n        logger.info(\"Start learning\")\r\n        self._main_net.train()\r\n        self._update_target_net()\r\n        self._target_net.eval()\r\n        self._explore(replay_start_size, discount_factor)\r\n        timestep = 0\r\n        max_average_score = numpy.NINF\r\n\r\n        while timestep < timestep_num:\r\n            is_done = False\r\n            next_frame_stack = self._train_env.reset()\r\n\r\n            while not is_done:\r\n                frame_stack = next_frame_stack\r\n                action = self._select_action(timestep, init_epsilon, final_epsilon, final_epsilon_frame, frame_stack)\r\n                (next_frame_stack, reward, is_done, info) = self._train_env.step(action)\r\n                mask = 0.0 if is_done else discount_factor\r\n                transition = (frame_stack, action, reward, mask, next_frame_stack)\r\n                self._replay_memory.append(transition)\r\n\r\n                if timestep % update_freq == 0:\r\n                    minibatch = self._replay_memory.sample(minibatch_size)\r\n                    self._update_main_net(minibatch[0], minibatch[1], minibatch[2], minibatch[3], minibatch[4])\r\n\r\n                if timestep % target_net_update_freq == 0:\r\n                    self._update_target_net()\r\n\r\n                if timestep % eval_freq == 0:\r\n                    max_average_score = self._evaluate(eval_episode_num, eval_epsilon, timestep, max_average_score, model_path)\r\n\r\n                timestep += 1\r\n\r\n        logger.info(\"Learning is done\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe network update occurs in the `self._update_main_net()`, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def _update_main_net(self, frame_stacks, actions, rewards, masks, next_frame_stacks):\r\n        y = self._calculate_y(rewards, masks, next_frame_stacks)\r\n        q = self._calculate_q(frame_stacks, actions)\r\n        self._main_net.update(y, q)\r\n\r\n    def _calculate_y(self, rewards, masks, next_frame_stacks):\r\n        next_states = self._frame_stack_to_state(next_frame_stacks, is_batch = True)\r\n        output = self._target_net.predict(next_states)\r\n        max_target_q = output.max(dim = 1)[0].unsqueeze(dim = -1)\r\n        rewards = torch.tensor(rewards, dtype = torch.float32, device = self._device).unsqueeze(dim = -1)\r\n        masks = torch.tensor(masks, dtype = torch.float32, device = self._device).unsqueeze(dim = -1)\r\n        y = rewards + masks * max_target_q\r\n        return y\r\n\r\n    def _calculate_q(self, frame_stacks, actions):\r\n        states = self._frame_stack_to_state(frame_stacks, is_batch = True)\r\n        output = self._main_net.predict(states)    # overloaded in `DSQN_RSTDP_Agent()`\r\n        actions = torch.tensor(actions, dtype = torch.int64, device = self._device).unsqueeze(dim = -1)\r\n        q = output.gather(dim = 1, index = actions)\r\n        return q\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `self._calculate_q()` is overloaded in `DSQN_RSTDP_Agent()`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you are running `DSQN_RSTDP` correctly. `python run.py --model=DSQN_RSTDP --device=cpu` is the command I used.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I also encountered another problem. When I was using the GPU, the program didn't work properly. I repeatedly checked and tried, and found that it only works properly using the CPU. That's why I use `--device=cpu`.\r\n\r\nThe environment I'm using is:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython=3.7.10\r\npytorch=1.7.1\r\ngym=0.18.0\r\nbindsnet=0.2.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you please try it again?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/842769000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AptX395","id":44229751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjI5NzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44229751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395","html_url":"https://github.com/AptX395","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AptX395/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/844227643","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/488#issuecomment-844227643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/488","id":844227643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NDIyNzY0Mw==","user":{"login":"SimonInParis","id":45327416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzI3NDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45327416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonInParis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-19T15:42:50Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T15:42:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi.\r\nJust ran your code.
