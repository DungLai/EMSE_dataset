you for the quick response. First of all I felt like there exists a basic introduction as to how to start building a network but after that the user is left on its own. To be more specific:\r\n\r\n- Because I am not just trying to implement machine learning algorithms, but I am also interested in the spiking neural networks' inner workings and their close relationship with computational neuroscience, I started by reading the published paper and trying running the examples presented there. Let me start by saying that those code examples should be located somewhere so readers could copy and paste them as it is a cumbersome process to have to write them line by line, which also leads to errors if you make a typo. Moreover and most importantly when I tried those examples I faced huge issues as they wouldn't run. When you google Bindsnet or Spiking Neural networks in PyTorch the published paper is very prominently presented in the results so its examples should be easily copied and successfully deployed.\r\n\r\n- There should exist step-by-step tutorials on various tasks with Bindsnet so new users can follow them and understand its operation. As an example, Nengo has a very nice structure in its examples, which cover a lot of topics.\r\n\r\n- There must be a clear explanation of the various parts of Bindsnet. For example today I tried to find a description of `EnvironmentPipeline` but there was no information in the documentation. I had to dug into the code, which led to having to search and connect multiple parts of multiple files, which is not ideal when you try to prototype something quickly.\r\n\r\nSomething that is not tied to the documentation per se but is a general comment, is that even now I am not really sure as to how active the development of Bindsnet is and whether a roadmap regarding this development exists. For example Nengo or NEST have news about newer versions and future milestones, but I haven't managed to find anything specific about Bindsnet. When you start developing in a specific framework you want to know how viable it is and I just can't find information about this topic or about any future plans for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/653656067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Adam-Antios","id":17729838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5ODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17729838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios","html_url":"https://github.com/Adam-Antios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-Antios/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/653953779","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/390#issuecomment-653953779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/390","id":653953779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Mzk1Mzc3OQ==","user":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-05T23:38:27Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T23:38:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thank you for your feedback, it is very useful.
