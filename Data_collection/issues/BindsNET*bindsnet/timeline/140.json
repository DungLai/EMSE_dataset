I think this is the best way to handle this problem, by the way, since it makes it easy for me to understand the issue before rewriting any code.\r\n\r\nThe implementation does seem wrong, like you say; I'll open a pull request with a fix and reference this issue in it, so you can check it out. I think one reason why it might be wrong is that we haven't really been using it in our lab for experiments. I simply implemented it one day because I read the M-STDP paper and thought it was an interesting idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/428605855/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1895774659,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg5NTc3NDY1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/1895774659","actor":{"login":"KyungsuKim42","id":24662250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjYyMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24662250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42","html_url":"https://github.com/KyungsuKim42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-10T14:58:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1895774660,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4OTU3NzQ2NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/1895774660","actor":{"login":"KyungsuKim42","id":24662250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjYyMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24662250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42","html_url":"https://github.com/KyungsuKim42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-10T14:58:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/428607594","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/140#issuecomment-428607594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/140","id":428607594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODYwNzU5NA==","user":{"login":"KyungsuKim42","id":24662250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjYyMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24662250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42","html_url":"https://github.com/KyungsuKim42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyungsuKim42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-10T15:02:45Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T15:02:45Z","author_assoc
