is a follow-up question to [issue#73](https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet/issues/73) where the question about testing was asked.\r\nI read the code from the [bindsnet_experiments](https://github.com/djsaunde/bindsnet_experiments/tree/master/experiments) and if I'm correct, testing is essentially \r\n- presenting test data to a network identical to the trained one except that it has no update rules,\r\n- this test network is initialised with the weights of the trained network,  and\r\n- neuron assignments (and proportions, rates, ...) updated by the network during training are used and not modified.\r\n\r\nSo if the above is correct, my question is : if learning rules were not removed, would that make the testing procedure invalid ? Is there any other way to test the network ?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nP.S. thanks for this library, it's great.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
