@rafaelblevin821 !\r\n\r\nBy installing BindsNET you get the CPU torch build by default.\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing prevents you from installing the GPU build if you need it. For example:\r\n```shell\r\n# automatically get the right version for your setup (for CUDA 11) \r\npython -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113\r\n# install a specific torch version\r\npython -m pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch-1.10.0%2Bcu113-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl\r\n```\r\nOr add \r\n```\r\ntorch = { url = \"https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch-1.10.0%2Bcu113-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl\", platform = \"linux\" }\r\n```\r\nto `pyproject.toml` if using Poetry.\r\n\r\nYou can choose the right version for your setup [here](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/). A convenient way to do it is to run `python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113` once and check which specific version is getting picked automatially. \r\n\r\nThe reason why torch is getting overwritten for you is because you don't seem to fix it's version. You can do it by using any python package manager like Poetry, conda, pyenv or even simply pip with a `requirements.txt` file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/1124560101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danielgafni","id":49863538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODYzNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49863538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgafni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6595340720,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBzWFSM5JbC4bzwAAAAGJHOmw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/6595340720","actor":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T05:56:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6595340726,"node_id":"SE_lADOBzWFSM5JbC4bzwAAAAGJHOm2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/6595340726","actor":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T05:56:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/1124726463","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/549#issuecomment-1124726463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/549","id":1124726463,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzWFSM5DCfa_","user":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"U

PyTorch?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/1124726463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6596528104,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBzWFSM5JbC4bzwAAAAGJLwfo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/6596528104","actor":{"login":"danielgafni","id":49863538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODYzNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49863538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgafni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T09:10:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6596528114,"node_id":"SE_lADOBzWFSM5JbC4bzwAAAAGJLwfy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/6596528114","actor":{"login":"danielgafni","id":49863538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODYzNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49863538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgafni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T09:10:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/1124732150","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/549#issuecomment-1124732150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/549","id":1124732150,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzWFSM5DCgz2","user":{"login":"danielgafni","id":49863538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODYzNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49863538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgafni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgafni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-12T09:16:12Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T09:
