Is there any other way to test the network?\r\n\r\nThere's no one \"valid\" way to test the network; what we did in the script you mentioned happened to work well for our use case / experiments. You're free to come up with your own methods of evaluating trained networks, which may or may not include learning (or other adaption) during the test phase. You can even add / remove components from the network at test time.\r\n\r\n> P.S. thanks for this library, it's great.\r\n\r\nThanks! :smile:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/489206841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2318233282,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxODIzMzI4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2318233282","actor":{"login":"alexmaraval","id":31925705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTI1NzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31925705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval","html_url":"https://github.com/alexmaraval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-03T19:07:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2318233283,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTgyMzMyODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2318233283","actor":{"login":"alexmaraval","id":31925705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTI1NzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31925705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval","html_url":"https://github.com/alexmaraval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexmaraval/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-03T19:07:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2321824562,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMyMTgyNDU2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2321824562","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-06T18:40:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
