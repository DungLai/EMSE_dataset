I used Pipeline, which I had to modify in order to be able to modify reward between getting it back from the Gym environment and feeding it to Network.run.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to have. I'm envisioning a new module (perhaps `bindsnet.reward` or `bindsnet.learning.reward`) that contains functions to this effect.\r\n\r\nAre there other possible implementations of predicted reward? A moving average seems a bit simplistic, whereas you might want the network itself to predict the reward by, e.g., predicting it as a function of the history of its inputs.\r\n\r\nOn another note, there's no requirement to use `Pipeline` for RL experiments. We typically find it too restrictive. We implemented it due to a request from our funding agency at the time.\r\n\r\n> I would like to implement this in BindsNET as well, so my questions are: have you heard of this? Has anyone tried to implement it yet, and how? Do you have a preferred way of implementing?\r\nI think it would be cool if someone can decide for their own how they want to implement the predicted reward. So we might need the ability to pass a function to Pipeline / Network. This might also cover the reward features discussed in #217.\r\n\r\nI've heard of it, but we haven't tried to implement it. I agree it'd be good to optionally pass in a constant or a `callable` (a `function`, or a `class` which defines `__call__`) to `Network.run`, which can be referenced / called on each timestep. By default (no `reward` argument), it would be `None`, and reward-modulated `LearningRule`s would throw an error. Or, it might be better implemented as a method / attribute / `@property` of the `Network` object; e.g., `Network.reward` would either reference a constant or invoke a `callable` object. This is something that might require some debate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/479485251/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/479485645","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/224#issuecomment-479485645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/224","id":479485645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTQ4NTY0NQ==","user":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T13:19:36Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T13:19:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"By the way, the plots you shared are really cool!

finally got around to looking at this. Looking at your `Network` constructor:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def __init__(self, dt: float = 1.0, learning: bool = True, reward: AbstractPredictedReward = None) -> None:\r\n        # language=rst\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Initializes network object.\r\n\r\n        :param dt: Simulation timestep.\r\n        :param learning: Whether to allow connection updates. True by default.\r\n        :param reward: Class allowing for modification of reward in case of reward-modulated learning.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        self.dt = dt\r\n        self.layers = {}\r\n        self.connections = {}\r\n        self.monitors = {}\r\n        self.learning = learning\r\n        self.reward = reward\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt expects `reward` to have type `AbstractPredictedReward`. However, you were passing in just the class `MovingAvgRPE`, not an instance of it: `MovingAvgRPE()`. And, it's never instantiated in the `Network` logic or before calling `Network.run()`. When I tried to instantiate `MovingAvgRPE`, I got an error because sub-classes must implement all abstract methods of their parent abstract class.\r\n\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nfrom bindsnet.network import Network\r\nfrom bindsnet.network.nodes import LIFNodes, Input\r\nfrom bindsnet.network.topology import Connection\r\nfrom bindsnet.learning import MSTDPET\r\nfrom bindsnet.learning.reward import MovingAvgRPE\r\nfrom bindsnet.encoding import poisson\r\n\r\n# Seed\r\nseed = 0\r\ntorch.manual_seed(seed)\r\nnp.random.seed(seed)\r\n\r\n# Build\r\nnet_lif = Network(dt=1.0, reward=MovingAvgRPE())\r\nnet_lif.add_layer(name='Input', layer=Input(5))\r\nnet_lif.add_layer(name='LIF', layer=LIFNodes(1))\r\nnet_lif.add_connection(\r\n    connection=Connection(source=net_lif.layers['Input'], target=net_lif.layers['LIF'], update_rule=MSTDPET),\r\n    source='Input', target='LIF')\r\n\r\n# Start\r\nspikes = poisson(torch.ones(5) * 40, time=1, dt=1.0)\r\nnet_lif.run(inpts={'Input': spikes[:, None, :]}, time=1, reward=10.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd uncomment the `compute` method of `MovingAvgRPE`, and change the following in `Network.run`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Compute reward prediction error.\r\n        if self.reward is not None:\r\n            try:\r\n                reward = kwargs['reward']\r\n                del kwargs['reward']\r\n                kwargs['reward'] = self.reward.compute(reward, **kwargs)\r\n            except KeyError:\r\n                raise KeyError('Reward should be specified!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I recommend changing `Network.reward` to `Network.reward_fn`, to disambiguate between the per-timestep reward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/480823706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Huizerd","id":15855769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU1NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15855769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd","html_url":"https://github.com/Huizerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T16:59:42Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T16:59:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/225","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/225/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/225/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/225/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/pull/225","id":430557996,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjY4NDE5NDQ2","number":225,"title":"Implementation
