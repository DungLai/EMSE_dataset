I have run [this](https://github.com/BINDS-LAB-UMASS/bindsnet_experiments/blob/master/experiments/mnist/diehl_and_cook_2015.py) example with no problem as per previous suggestion. However, when I try to use the same setting in a new PC, this [line](https://github.com/BINDS-LAB-UMASS/bindsnet_experiments/blob/8a20be9d1ede021b70ff95cc7e85024ff5a222db/experiments/mnist/diehl_and_cook_2015.py#L22) hinders the code from running, with the following error message.\r\n\r\n> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n>   File \"diehl_and_cook_2015.py\", line 22, in <module>\r\n>     from experiments.utils import update_curves, print_results\r\n> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'experiments'\r\n\r\nI tried some actions that I found online but it is still not working. What should be the solution?\r\nThanks in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/551276898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2780938634,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyNzgwOTM4NjM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2780938634","actor":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-07T21:38:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/632953106","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/248#issuecomment-632953106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/248","id":632953106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjk1MzEwNg==","user":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-23T00:20:37Z","updated_at":"2020-05-23T00:20:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Try to use the 'eth_mnist.py' in the example directory and lets us know if the issue exists.
