there was [this bug](https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/577) preventing the RL example (`breakout_stdp.py`) to work, I am pretty confident that whether that script worked or not wasn't tested (unless the bug was introduced later on, haven't checked).\r\n\r\nHowever, I noticed that solving that bug doesn't help the network learn the task.\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether anyone has managed to make the `breakout_stdp.py` script to work (that is, having the network to solve the task). Maybe it's just about finding the right hyperparameters?\r\n\r\nI have also tried another gym task (the cart pole) but haven't been successful with it either. To get the input spikes I convert the observation values into [0, 1] values and pass them into the bernoulli encoding. Still doesn't work. Any idea would be _really_ appreciated.
