It's quite disorganized, though, and I wouldn't recommend using it.\r\n\r\nSomething similar, however, can be found [in the BindsNET experiments repo](https://github.com/djsaunde/bindsnet_experiments/blob/master/experiments/mnist/increasing_inhibition.py). It might need some tweaking in order to work correctly.\r\n\r\nIn BindsNET, for the test phase, you can set `network.learning = False` to disable updates by `LearningRule`s. But, you may also want to freeze thresholds on neurons with adaptive thresholds. E.g., before we added the `network.learning` flag, [here](https://github.com/djsaunde/bindsnet_experiments/blob/3c06d346ded360173a7f94bd84d6fa01312316f8/experiments/mnist/increasing_inhibition.py#L99) I created a no-op learning rule in place of the old STDP rule, and set the adaptive threshold parameters of the `DiehlAndCookNodes` to 0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/487028869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2302863653,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMwMjg2MzY1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2302863653","actor":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T11:46:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2302863654,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMDI4NjM2NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2302863654","actor":{"login":"rachmadvwp","id":33402690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAyNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33402690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp","html_url":"https://github.com/rachmadvwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachmadvwp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T11:46:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/487794143","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/235#issuecomment-487794143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/235","id":487794143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4Nzc5NDE0Mw==","user":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T01:05:15Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T01:05:15Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi

Or I have to do separate things, \"training\" first, save the models in some files (freezing the parameters) and read it back for \"test\" phase?\r\n \r\nIs `network.learning = False` the one in the [bindsnet/network/\\__init__.py](https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet/blob/master/bindsnet/network/__init__.py) ?\r\n\r\nAnother question is that, how can I use the BindsNET experiments repo along with the BindsNET framework?
