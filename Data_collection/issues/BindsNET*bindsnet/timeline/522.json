am sorry if the docs confuse you, please let me know how can we improve the [docs in link ](https://bindsnet-docs.readthedocs.io/guide/guide_part_i.html). \r\n\r\nFrom the docs link above, `snn.run()` accept inputs either in shape of `[time, *input_shape]` or `[time, batch_size, *input_shape]`, keeping PyTorch format. Since your input shape is `[1,28,28]`, the shape `[time, 1, 28, 28]` and shape `[time, 5, 1, 28, 28]` are incorrect. The correct shape should be `[time, 1, 1, 28, 28]` since the batch size is `1` and the input shape is `1, 28, 28` in your case. \r\n\r\nIf however the input was 768 then input shape of `[time,768]` will work like in the example in the doc link about. \r\n\r\nTo see how to use batch in the input, please see the [batch example
