@ati6868, at the moment, it makes no sense to connect to a layer of `Input` nodes, they simply discard their input. `Input` nodes spikes are set by the user by passing them to `network.run(inputs=...)`.\r\n\r\nYou could instead create a network with a layer of `Input` nodes (A), connected to a layer of `LIFNodes` (B), which is recurrently connected to itself, or connected to a third layer of `LIFNodes` (C) which connects back to B.\r\n\r\nIt might be good to support adding support for your use case, though; I'll look into it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/547901966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2755964948,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1NTk2NDk0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2755964948","actor":{"login":"ati6868","id":52522391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIyMzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52522391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868","html_url":"https://github.com/ati6868","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T13:27:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2755964950,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTU5NjQ5NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2755964950","actor":{"login":"ati6868","id":52522391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIyMzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52522391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868","html_url":"https://github.com/ati6868","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T13:27:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/547910553","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/332#issuecomment-547910553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/332","id":547910553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzkxMDU1Mw==","user":{"login":"ati6868","id":52522391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIyMzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52522391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868","html_url":"https://github.com/ati6868","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T13:45:43Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T13:57:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank

this?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/548235471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ati6868","id":52522391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIyMzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52522391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868","html_url":"https://github.com/ati6868","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ati6868/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/548345450","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/332#issuecomment-548345450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/332","id":548345450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODM0NTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"dee0512","id":7398932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTg5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7398932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512","html_url":"https://github.com/dee0512","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T12:19:44Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T12:19:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@ati6868 The input layer takes a pre-defined spike train and outputs it. I do not think you want to do that. The input layer simply provides a way to input spikes into a network. For your network, therefore, you would want 3 layers as @djsaunde suggested:\r\n\r\n> You could instead create a network with a layer of Input nodes (A), connected to a layer of LIFNodes (B), which is recurrently connected to itself, or connected to a third layer of LIFNodes (C) which connects back to B.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, the Input nodes (A) will be connected on a one to one basis to the LIFNodes, thus ensuring that the first LIFNodes (B) receive the MNIST images. (B) is then connected to a third layer of LIFNodes (C) which connects back to the lower layer (B) creating a feedback. Therefore, essentially, your network just contains 2 layers (B) and (C), the input nodes just provide a way to input the MNIST images as spikes into your network.

PR is a little tricky, so I don't expect it to get merged right away. Addresses use cases discussed in #332 and #333. Namely, this adds support for:\r\n\r\n- Incoming connections to `Input` nodes that do something. `Input` nodes now use input from incoming connections instead of discarding it in favor of what's passed by `network.run(inputs=...)`. NB: users have to be a bit more careful with data types in this situation.\r\n- The output of `Input` nodes can now have any type; this subsumes the `RealInput` nodes class, which has been removed as a result.\r\n- Any kind of node can take input passed to `network.run(inputs=...)`. For example, you can create a network with only `LIFNodes` (no `Input` nodes), and inject input directly to them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/335/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/335/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
