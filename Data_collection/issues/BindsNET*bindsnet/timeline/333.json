PR is a little tricky, so I don't expect it to get merged right away. Addresses use cases discussed in #332 and #333. Namely, this adds support for:\r\n\r\n- Incoming connections to `Input` nodes that do something. `Input` nodes now use input from incoming connections instead of discarding it in favor of what's passed by `network.run(inputs=...)`. NB: users have to be a bit more careful with data types in this situation.\r\n- The output of `Input` nodes can now have any type; this subsumes the `RealInput` nodes class, which has been removed as a result.\r\n- Any kind of node can take input passed to `network.run(inputs=...)`. For example, you can create a network with only `LIFNodes` (no `Input` nodes), and inject input directly to them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/335/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/335/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2805724690,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgwNTcyNDY5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2805724690","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-17T22:11:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
