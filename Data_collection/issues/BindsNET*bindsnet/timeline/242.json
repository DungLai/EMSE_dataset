this is my initial take on #242. There is a light wrapper around all of the datasets provided by torchvision which should be relatively easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n`spike_encoders.py` houses wrappers around your encoding that are setup to work like the transforms provided by torchvision. Should this live in `bindsnet/datasets` or should it live in `bindsnet/encoding` since these are relatively generic objects?\r\n\r\nThe changes to `bindsnet/network/__init__.py` is motivated by keeping the default pytorch DataLoader which creates (in our case) BxTxCxHxW and having the time dimension be arbitrary seems like a good solution.\r\n\r\nNot everything is implemented yet (hence WIP), but I wanted to make sure this was heading in a direction you guys are comfortable with before spending the time to wrap everything up. The TODO list includes putting spoken_mnist back in, example for a non-convolutional network, update other examples to use this new loading paradigm, work in a dataset that originated as spiking (simply to provide an example from that direction).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/494851723","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/242#issuecomment-494851723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/242","id":494851723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDg1MTcyMw==","user":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T15:25:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T15:25:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Merged #243 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/494851723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2359731005,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM1OTczMTAwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2359731005","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-22T15:25:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
