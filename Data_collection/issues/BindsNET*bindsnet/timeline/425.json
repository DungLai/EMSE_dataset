They are right, but it seems to cause by using wrong method of input. In their script they prepare a huge input matrix in the size of the network running time and use it as an input. If, however in file `bindsnet_lif.py` you replace line 24 to 33 with those lines:\r\n```\r\nfrom bindsnet.encoding import poisson\r\ninput_data = {\"Input\": poisson(\r\n    datum=torch.rand(\r\n            (parameters.batch_size, parameters.features),\r\n                device=parameters.device),\r\n        time=T * parameters.sequence_length, device=parameters.device)}\r\n```\r\nThe script will run for more neurons. (how many? Depends on how much memory your GPU have.)\r\n\r\nWhen benchmarking, it is also a good practice to nullify the network object after each run and to clean up before each test run, add the lines below after line 57 at `main.py` will insure that GPU memory and cache will be clean.\r\n```\r\nimport gc \r\ngc.collect()\r\nimport torch\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    torch.cuda.empty_cache() \r\n```\r\nHere the result of the script after the corrections:\r\n![final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3954715/98124841-b3239480-1e81-11eb-884d-5a47855bc51f.png)\r\n\r\nBindsNET run out of GPU memory on more than 130,000 neurons\r\nNorse run out of GPU memory on more than 125,000 neurons\r\nBut that can be expected on GPU with 12Gb of memory. \r\n\r\nOverall, both frameworks use PyTorch, so the performance and the memory utilization should be similar. \r\nInterestingly, Norse created a unique LIF node that is used in the benchmarks. And to be fair, they use JIT PyTorch optimizations decorators that can potentially make the code run faster. It is able to compile the code to C++ and leverage the fast running time of the hardware, although surprisingly this change has less of effect here. Using the PyTorch JIT optimizer also makes the debugging process much harder, the Python/PyTorch compiled code throws nasty error messages that are much harder to understand, that is why we prefer not to use it in BindsNET.\r\n\r\nNote also the standard deviation of the BindsNET script is negligible.
