In fact, I really like this change. I agree that there is redundancy in the naming logic at the moment.\r\n\r\n> Is my example just a contrived case that doesn't reflect the real world?\r\n\r\nIIUC, this change should cover all use cases. Once a layer is named, the layer's `name` attribute can be used to automatically name connections. \r\n\r\nIf everyone else agrees that this is a good change, would you mind putting together a PR with this change? On top of updating the `bindsnet.network` logic, we'll have to update the `examples`, tests, and documentation to reflect this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/678795949/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3682960383,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzY4Mjk2MDM4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/3682960383","actor":{"login":"krooq","id":7934581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzQ1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7934581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq","html_url":"https://github.com/krooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-23T16:36:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3682960384,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2ODI5NjAzODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/3682960384","actor":{"login":"krooq","id":7934581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzQ1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7934581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq","html_url":"https://github.com/krooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-23T16:36:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/678830717","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/407#issuecomment-678830717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/407","id":678830717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODgzMDcxNw==","user":{"login":"krooq","id":7934581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzQ1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7934581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq","html_url":"https://github.com/krooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krooq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-23T22:06:05Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T22:06:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sure

in Python (most other languages) objects have a unique int identifier `id()`, this is managed by the runtime, I don't think its mutable.  It's just more robust and concise to use this built in identifier for equality than a string.  \r\nIt also separates the naming semantics from the identification if for some reason the user wanted to rename nodes (maybe a GUI editor would have this feature).\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert on the use cases of all the features of BindsNET, perhaps having a string key for Nodes advantageous especially for those that are less exposed to code.\r\nSince most of the time users will only be working in one file it's probably unnecessary to change the way the Nodes are keyed (i.e. replace the strings).\r\n\r\nI think the automatic naming could be a neat feature.\r\nIt would mean the naming is tied to the context of the network (as the index of the layer is required to produce the name). Although I don't think this is a bad thing, that's how it works at the moment.\r\nIt just means that the name can't live on the Nodes object, it will have to be owned by the network.\r\nIt could look something like this:\r\n```\r\n    def add_layer(self, layer: Nodes, name: str = None) -> None:\r\n       # ask the layer for a new name based on the nb of existing layers\r\n        label = name if

@djsaunde in Python (most other languages) objects have a unique int identifier id(), this is managed by the runtime, I don't think its mutable. It's just more robust and concise to use this built in identifier for equality than a string.\r\nIt also separates the naming semantics from the identification if for some reason the user wanted to rename nodes (maybe a GUI editor would have this feature).\r\n\r\n> I'm not an expert on the use cases of all the features of BindsNET, perhaps having a string key for Nodes advantageous especially for those that are less exposed to code.\r\nSince most of the time users will only be working in one file it's probably unnecessary to change the way the Nodes are keyed (i.e. replace the strings).\r\n\r\nOkay, thanks for the explanation. I think we'll table this idea for now, but I like the discussion.\r\n\r\n> I think the automatic naming could be a neat feature.\r\nIt would mean the naming is tied to the context of the network (as the index of the layer is required to produce the name). Although I don't think this is a bad thing, that's how it works at the moment.\r\nIt just means that the name can't live on the Nodes object, it will have to be owned by the network.\r\n\r\nYup, that all makes sense. I'll create a separate GitHub issue for this (labeled as an \"enhancement\") for any discussion related to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/680967564/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3695498903,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzY5NTQ5ODkwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/3695498903","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-26T15:54:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3695498907,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2OTU0OTg5MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/3695498907","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-26T15:54:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-26T15:57:10Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T15:57:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/408","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/408/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/408/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/408/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet
