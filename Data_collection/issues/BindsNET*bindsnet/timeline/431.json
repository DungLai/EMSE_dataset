proposed a batch of 320 just to have the fastest running model on GPU,\r\nbut very large batches tend to train the model slower, paradoxically.\r\nSo there's a balance here.\r\nUsually, you can get very good results with a batch size around 32 (default\r\nvalue). Lower batch sizes take longer to train but reach slightly higher\r\nresults.\r\nAfter 2 or 3 epochs, you should get over 90% or more.\r\n\r\nBatches in SNN are tricky. Learning of each batch is summed, then applied\r\nto the weights.

You are right! Somehow, some recent changes in the plotting system takes the computation out of the GPU. Just edit the source and remove plotting (--plot option), and it will run again on the GPU. for ex.: [image: image.png] Once fixed, and with batch_size=320, I get about 30 seconds/epoch. Thanks for finding this bug. We will investigate. Simon\r\n> […](#)\r\n\r\nHi, @Hananel-Hazan , @SimonInParis. I run batch_eth_mnist.py using Colab with Tesla K80. Plotting is turned off, but the training speed is very slow, about 10 minute/epoch. I don't where the problem is.

Somehow, some recent changes in the plotting system takes the computation out of the GPU. Just edit the source and remove plotting (--plot option), and it will run again on the GPU. for ex.: [image: image.png] Once fixed, and with batch_size=320, I get about 30 seconds/epoch. Thanks for finding this bug. We will investigate.
