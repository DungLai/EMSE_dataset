Simulation takes place synchronously, meaning every layer is updated on each time step using the network state from the previous time step.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing stopping you from making a connection from layer `Ae` to another layer, and the order which it's added in doesn't matter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/549205509/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2766411899,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2NjQxMTg5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2766411899","actor":{"login":"WongyuLee1729","id":48536472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTM2NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48536472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729","html_url":"https://github.com/WongyuLee1729","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-04T02:06:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2766411900,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjY0MTE5MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2766411900","actor":{"login":"WongyuLee1729","id":48536472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTM2NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48536472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729","html_url":"https://github.com/WongyuLee1729","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WongyuLee1729/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-04T02:06:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2795559119,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc5NTU1OTExOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2795559119","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T14:47:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
