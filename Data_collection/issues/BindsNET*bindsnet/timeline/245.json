I think it will be relatively straightforward to implement, especially since we can borrow from PyTorch.\r\n\r\nI think there are some conceptual issues:\r\n\r\n- How to update adaptive neuron parameters, e.g., neurons' adaptive thresholds? Take average or sum of updates across batch dimension (average makes intuitive sense to me)?\r\n- If we run two simulations back-to-back without resetting in between, how do we reconcile neurons' different initial conditions? Maybe enforce resetting between simulations?\r\n- What do we do when batch sizes change between simulations?\r\n- Should we adjust learning rates with batch sizes? E.g., if we run 10 examples at once with a learning rate of 0.01, should each example contribute to overall weight updates with a learning rate of 0.001?\r\n\r\nAnyways, we can get _something_

PR is meant to stimulate discussion, and is not necessarily a final version. Closes #245.\r\n\r\nSimulation is parallelized by creating N copies of neuron state variables (voltages, spike occurrences, refractory period counters, ...) and aggregating changes to adaptive parameters (weights, adaptive thresholds, ...) over the course of simulation. Network now takes an optional argument `batch_size`, to pre-allocate tensors for component state variables.\r\n\r\nInputs to the network now have shape `[time, n_1, ..., n_k]` or `[batch_size, time, n_1, ..., n_k]`. This subsumes the old implementation. If the rank of an input tensor is 2, mini-batch size is assumed to be 1; if the rank of an input tensor is 1, the minibatch size and simulation time are assumed to be 1. If the rank of the input tensor is >= 3, the first dimension is assumed to be the mini-batch size, the second, simulation time, and the rest must match the shape of the corresponding input layer.\r\n\r\nAlso supports \"dynamic batch size\", where, if the input data has minibatch size unequal to what was originally passed, the network re-initializes the component state variables that are sensitive to minibatch size (voltages, spike occurrences, refractory period counters, ...)\r\n\r\nBreaking changes:\r\n- Monitor objects recordings now have shape `[time, batch_size, n_1, ..., n_k]` to match most other parts of the code. This is a change from the old shape, `[n_1, ..., n_k, time]`.\r\n\r\nDesiderata:\r\n- torch.utils.data.DataLoader loads items from our dataset wrappers with shape `[batch_size, time, n_1, ..., n_k]`. I'd prefer this would match the convention `[time, batch_size, n_1, ..., n_k]` in most other parts of the code (CC @k-chaney, any thoughts on this?)\r\n- Aggregation of changes to adaptive parameters (weights, adaptive thresholds, ...) are summed across the minibatch dimension. As we've discussed (@coopersigrist), this makes sense in most cases, but it would be nice to have other aggregation options (e.g., mean, max) which can be passed as an argument to the constructor of a `LearningRule`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I've missed anything, and I'll update this comment accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2451135824,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ1MTEzNTgyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2451135824","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-01T13:01:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
