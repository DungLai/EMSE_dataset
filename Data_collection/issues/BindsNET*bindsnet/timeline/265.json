You need a way to allow the network to distinguish between different states. One way of doing this is using so-called place or grid cells, which also happen to be [present](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-brain-maps-out-ideas-and-memories-like-spaces-20190114/) in animal brains. The core idea is that you need to (uniformly) distribute some Poisson neurons over your state space, and make their firing rate dependent on the distance between their center and the current state of the agent. In this way, different states will lead to different firing patterns, and the network is able to learn something. See an example of an implementation in [this paper](https://intranet.physio.unibe.ch/Publikationen/Dokumente/Vasilaki2009PloSComputBio_1.pdf). If I remember correctly, most encodings in BindsNET are mainly suitable for pixel intensities.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/497461062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Huizerd","id":15855769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU1NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15855769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd","html_url":"https://github.com/Huizerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/497486681","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/265#issuecomment-497486681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/265","id":497486681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzQ4NjY4MQ==","user":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T21:08:02Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T21:08:02Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@4iar We (the BINDS lab) haven't managed to get SNNs to learn any interesting in OpenAI gym environments.

@4iar,\r\n\r\nNo problem. The [bindsnet/conversion module](https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet/blob/master/bindsnet/conversion/__init__.py) contains code for converting PyTorch ANNs with only ReLU activations to SNNs. The networks that result from the conversion can then be used to do the same task that the PyTorch ANN was trained to do, typically with little loss in performance.\r\n\r\n[This script](https://github.com/djsaunde/bindsnet_experiments/blob/master/experiments/conversion/fully_connected_mnist.py) is perhaps the simplest example we have at the moment. It builds and trains a fully-connected multi-layer ANN to classify the MNIST digits, converts it to an SNN, and evaluates it on the MNIST test data. However, there have been a lot of changes to BindsNET since we've written the script, so it will likely require some
