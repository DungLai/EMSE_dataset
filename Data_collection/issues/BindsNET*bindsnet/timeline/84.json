I know exactly what you mean because it was one of the things I mentioned to Hananel. The main complaint I had was with the \"ngram\" method itself. If `n=5` then we create a window of sizes `n=2, 3, 4, 5` and slide each one across our \"firing order\" for that timestep of an example. But in the \"ngram\" method, we ONLY use the largest `n` size to evaluate. I looked at the lmm-snn repo to check what was implemented there and although we record all the tuples of different sizes up to the maximum `n` size, we evaluate ONLY for the largest `n`. I think there should be another outer loop which should go over the different window sizes same as `update_ngram_scores`.\r\n\r\n
