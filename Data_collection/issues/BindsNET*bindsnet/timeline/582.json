I wonder if, when you say that MSTDPET works on Atari-like game, you mean that I could just change the `learning_rule` to MSTDPET in `breakout_stdp.py` and check if it works - or there are more hyperparameters to change.  I also think that the `example/breakout_stdp.py` should be changed in the repo to use the appropriate learning rule/hyperp. that works (happy to do that once I get a working version).\r\n\r\nI also thought that CartPole would be fairly easy to solve, but alas it just doesn't learn. \r\nThe network is as simple as the `breakout_stdp` net: \r\n```\r\ninpt = Input(n=n_input, traces=True)\r\nmiddle = LIFNodes(n=n_hidden, traces=True)\r\nout = LIFNodes(n=n_output, refrac=0, traces=True)\r\n```\r\nwith 4 input, 50 hidden (but I have tried many variation of those), and 2 outputs. I have tried changing wmin and wmax, and even allowing negative weights and biases, with no luck. \r\n\r\nI am not bounded to this particular model - or even to any particular learning rule - or even on this specific gym env. I want to develop a research idea with spiking nets, but this hinges on having at least a model that can learn in a RL setup.\r\n\r\nI will try MSTDPET and report, but in the meantime any other idea is welcome.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/1239244869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ValerioB88","id":17203078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAzMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17203078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88","html_url":"https://github.com/ValerioB88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7337882497,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBzWFSM5RUoxLzwAAAAG1XzOB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/7337882497","actor":{"login":"SimonInParis","id":45327416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzI3NDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45327416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonInParis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-07T11:06:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7337882502,"node_id":"SE_lADOBzWFSM5RUoxLzwAAAAG1XzOG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/7337882502","actor":{"login":"SimonInParis","id":45327416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzI3NDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45327416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonInParis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonInParis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-07T11:06:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7944234507,"node_id":"CE_lADOBzWFSM5RUoxLzwAAAAHZg2YL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/7944234507","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-02T22:12:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
