Only user-passed data (in the inpts dictionary) is used by nodes subclassing `AbstractInput`. In fact, it might be good to throw a warning, or even an error, if this kind of connectivity exists. It doesn't make sense because it won't do anything.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, nodes subclassing `AbstractGenerator` would discard inputs from layers connecting to it. My idea is that generator nodes would have attributes which would determine their output activity. For example, for a `PoissonGenerator`, it might have an attribute `rates` which determine the firing rates, in Hertz, of the neurons in the layer. The user could set this prior to simulation, or between simulations:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom bindsnet.network import Network\r\nfrom bindsnet.network.nodes import PoissonGenerator\r\n\r\nnetwork = Network()\r\ninput_layer = PoissonGenerator(rates=0, n=100, ...)  # Input layer of size 100.\r\nnetwork.add_layer(input_layer, name=\"I\")\r\nrates = 120 * torch.rand(100)  # Input data of size 100; specifies firing rates in [0Hz, 120Hz].\r\ninput_layer.rates = rates\r\nnetwork.run(inpts={}, time=1000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above, the `PoissonGenerator` would generate spikes according to a Poisson process (sample x ~ Uniform(0, 1) and check if x < (rates / 1000) * dt).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could pass `inpts={\"I\": rates}`, which would simply set the `rates` attribute of the `PoissonGenerator` object at the beginning of `network.run`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/516036792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/516155020","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/301#issuecomment-516155020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/301","id":516155020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjE1NTAyMA==","user":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T20:44:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T21:05:02Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"You are right,  because `AbstractInput` is only abstract, its behavior need to be corrected. \r\nThe rest of the nodes have the same behavior because Nodes are the Soma of neuron, they getting the sum of input, and outputting value according to function.
