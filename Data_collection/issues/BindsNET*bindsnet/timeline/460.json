@Afstkla, \r\nThe network you are trying to implement looks very interesting.\r\n\r\nSadly, sparse matrices is still in beta stage on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/sparse.html). On BindsNET side we still missing some math operation to fully take advantage of this nifty feature. Try to use a regular weights, I hope that will solve the problem for now. \r\nWhen PyTorch support all the math operations that BindsNET need, we will add it too.
