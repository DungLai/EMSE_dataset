about the delay, I've been diving into the other feature I'm working on. This seems like a reasonable change. I just pushed a branch `chaney/gym_env_encoder_fix` that deals with this as described. \r\n\r\n1) Do we want the encoders to be in their own module or should we leverage the encodings module that already exists?\r\n2) For the `GymEnvironment` the encoder default is `NullEncoder`.\r\n3) For the `torchvision.dataset` wrapping, we should probably keep them as mandatory positional arguments and just allow `None` to convert to `NullEncoder` in the constructor. This maintains the format of bindsnet arguments first and then the dataset specific arguments second and as keyword arguments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/496292562/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k-chaney","id":3302546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3302546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney","html_url":"https://github.com/k-chaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/496323233","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/254#issuecomment-496323233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/254","id":496323233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjMyMzIzMw==","user":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-28T00:01:34Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T00:01:34Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks @k-chaney. \r\nYes, leveraging the encoder module is preferred. 2 and 3 look good.
