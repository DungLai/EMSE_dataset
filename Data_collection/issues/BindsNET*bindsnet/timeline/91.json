On the other hand, small-scale experiments seem to take more time to run on the GPU.\r\n\r\nI've also tested with an NVIDIA Quadro M1200, where I observed similar runtime behavior, but the 1060 card definitely gave better results for larger networks.\r\n\r\nIntuitively, this makes sense to me, as GPUs are known for being useful for single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instructions, and large tensors can fit in GPU memory. However, busing data back and forth from the main memory to the GPU memory may be the speed bottleneck in the small-scale simulations.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it depends on the structure and size of the network being simulated.

I have a GTX 1060 6gb that I use to test the code, and found that there are some great time savings when the simulated networks are large. On the other hand, small-scale experiments seem to take more time to run on the GPU.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/416253549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1810800052,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgxMDgwMDA1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/1810800052","actor":{"login":"haoyz","id":17598191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTk4MTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17598191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-27T14:52:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1810800054,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MTA4MDAwNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/1810800054","actor":{"login":"haoyz","id":17598191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTk4MTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17598191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-27T14:52:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/416253926","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/91#issuecomment-416253926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/91","id":416253926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjI1MzkyNg==","user":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-27T14:53:48Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T14:53:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"As

I haven't had any problems with this approach yet. It would be nice to have `cpu()` / `gpu()` functions for the `Network` / `Nodes` / 'Connection' objects (see https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet/issues/160). Keep in mind (see above discussion) that enabling GPU computation won't always result in faster simulation.\r\n\r\nAs for batch computing, this may be complicated. Remember that `Nodes` objects typically maintain state (voltages, refractory periods, etc.), so computing over a batch will require duplicating those state variables (over a batch dimension) and keeping track of them independently during simulation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/457604541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
