The code runs fine on Linux and WSL2 with GPU (although WSL2 have slow GPU performance, but it works without an issue).\r\n\r\nIf you run a google on : ```PyTorch dataloader AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'create_torchvision_dataset_wrapper.<locals>.TorchvisionDatasetWrapper'``` I believe you can come to the same conclusion, that there is problem with PyTorch on windows with lambda calculation \r\n\r\nIf you want to try to play with the code, try not to use `lambda` calculation in line 120. I think this may resolve the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/785433894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4373580006,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDM3MzU4MDAwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/4373580006","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-24T22:44:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4373580017,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDM3MzU4MDAxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/4373580017","actor":{"login":"envysir","id":32240006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjQwMDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32240006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir","html_url":"https://github.com/envysir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-24T22:44:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4373580019,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzNzM1ODAwMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/4373580019","actor":{"login":"envysir","id":32240006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjQwMDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32240006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir","html_url":"https://github.com/envysir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envysir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-24T22:44:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
