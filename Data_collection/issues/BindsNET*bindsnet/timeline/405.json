Moreover, Brian uses more complex synapses to transmit the spikes between neurons. There are probably more changes than this, but that enough to make some differences between the two platforms. Especially in our case, where we use the current values to calculate the next steps, like in any other dynamic system, small changes can offset you in the long run.  \r\nTo increase accuracy, run a parameter search to find the best parameters. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/674603019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3659788217,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY1OTc4ODIxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/3659788217","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-17T00:46:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
