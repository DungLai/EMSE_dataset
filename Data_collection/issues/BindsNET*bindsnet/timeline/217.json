bounded and the other positively bounded. You could also implement this feature within BindsNET: for each weight, include a wmin and wmax (instead of having a single, global wmin, wmax for the whole connection).\r\n\r\nI have also modified the network.run to accept the desired output and calculate the reward based on that. Basically in the Florian experiments, reward is given when the output neuron either spikes or does not spike. Therefore, you can only know the reward while simulating.

We could pass in a reference to a reward function. In the constructor of a reward-modulated learning rule, we could pass in a reward function that takes (state, action) pairs and maps them to a scalar reward. Is this similar to your approach? Could you link me to your code that implements this fix?\r\n\r\nI think something like this is preferred, however a reward function that accepts `(state, action)` might not work well in all cases. The Gym environments, for example, have this reward function built in and only give back reward (so we should leave that as an option at least). For the case where someone creates a custom environment (without the Gym framework), they would need an action selection function (spikes of certain layer -> action) and a reward function (state + action -> reward). So it might work for this case.\r\n\r\nThe approach by @dee0512 modifies the `network.run` in a non-universal way: it works only for the Florian experiments, see: https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet/blob/8c62e027f741f8acdfc51f431d351b9abf67b022/bindsnet/network/__init__.py#L300\r\n\r\nI calculated the reward inside the loop where `network.run` is called each time, see: https://gist.github.com/Huizerd/9c794260e629613b66750043d583a1a2#file-rl_mstdp_florian2007_exp4-3-py-L177\r\n\r\nbut I think @djsaunde's way (or something analogous to it) is the cleanest solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/477285541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Huizerd","id":15855769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU1NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15855769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd","html_url":"https://github.com/Huizerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2234047474,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIzNDA0NzQ3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2234047474","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-27T18:07:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2234047477,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMzQwNDc0Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2234047477","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-27T18:07:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2234047482,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIzNDA0NzQ4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2234047482","actor":{"login":"dee0512","id":7398932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTg5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7398932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512","html_url":"https://github.com/dee0512","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-27T18:07:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2234047483,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMzQwNDc0ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/2234047483","actor":{"login":"dee0512","id":7398932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTg5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/739
