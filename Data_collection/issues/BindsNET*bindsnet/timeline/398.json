We may need to set the `numpy` random generator and not only the torch one.\r\n2. Maybe torch random seed and numpy random seed are connected somehow. The `n_neurons` use also by `numpy` random generator to draw the input neurons (line 195)\r\n3. When you set the random seed, the sequence of random numbers is deterministic. That suggests that somewhere else in the script (BindsNET, PyTorch, etc) also draw more (or less) numbers from that random sequence, and this change the place where the numbers use for image sequence is no longer the same place as before. \r\n\r\nIs this seems reasonable?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/667730215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hananel-Hazan","id":3954715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTQ3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3954715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hananel-Hazan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/667837104","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/398#issuecomment-667837104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/398","id":667837104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzgzNzEwNA==","user":{"login":"Danielle-Schuman","id":52699523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjk5NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52699523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman","html_url":"https://github.com/Danielle-Schuman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danielle-Schuman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-03T06:46:44Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T06:46:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, that actually makes a lot of sense.
