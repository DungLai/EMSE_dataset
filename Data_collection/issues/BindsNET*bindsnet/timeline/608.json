With a dt=1, a Poisson process will produce on average 1 spike for each dt. However, it will sometime produce more, and sometime less. However, for each dt we only want to know whether there was a spike or not, thus capping the number of spikes at 1 for each dt. This will consistently under-estimate the number of spikes. \r\n(the `encoding.poisson` seems to produce spikes in a slightly different way, but I think the result is the same and the problem is still there).\r\n\r\nIf this hypothesis is correct, then I would expect even less spikes when dt is higher (since theoretically we would produce N spikes for each dt, but we are still capping it at 1). Indeed :\r\n`poisson(torch.tensor(1000, dtype=torch.float32), time=1000, dt=10).sum()` -> ~100 spikes\r\n(instead of ~1000).\r\n\r\nThe important thing is that this is almost a non problem for more realistic Hz values (that is, much lower, ~1Hz), since it's much less likely that we'll get more than a spike in each single dt. Therefore, maybe, this works as intended and not cause for concern at all. Any idea?

This is exactly the definition given here: https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/handouts/poisson.pdf  (equation 3)\r\n\r\nWith a 50 hz and time=dt=1 we just have a *very* low chance to get a spike within that dt (and thus within time). The total time (that is, how many \"dt\" we consider) does not affect the probability for each dt.  So most of the time `poisson(torch.tensor(50, dtype=torch.float32), time=1, dt=1)` should give 0, but sometime it should give 1, and with 1000 times should give 1 around 50 times. \r\n\r\nIf the Poisson distribution in this case has a different meaning please let me know!

Hananel, \r\n\r\nWhat about just using something like this? \r\n```\r\ndef poisson2(datum, time, dt, clip=True):\r\n    dist = torch.distributions.Poisson(rate=datum * dt / 1000, validate_args=False)\r\n    intervals = dist.sample(sample_shape=torch.Size([time//dt]))\r\n    if clip:\r\n        intervals = torch.clip(intervals, max=1)\r\n    return intervals\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis produces slightly different distributions than the method in `encoding.poisson`. I do believe my method is the correct one, but I am not sure mostly because I do not understand what does `encoding.poisson` do.\r\n\r\nNote that when `clip=True`, we are automatically enforcing a maximum of one spike per dt (as in `encoding.poisson`. Like the original function, this will under-produce spikes consistently, but I think it's required for the rest of bindsnet to work. However, the user might disable it. We can also disable it to check that the result are theoretically valid when no clipping is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome comparisons:\r\n\r\n100Hz\r\n```\r\nplt.hist([poisson2(100, 1000, dt=1, clip=False).sum().item() for _ in range(2000)], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='poisson2 no clip')\r\nplt.hist([poisson2(100, 1000, dt=1, clip=True).sum().item() for _ in range(2000)], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='poisson2 w clip')\r\nplt.hist([poisson(torch.tensor([100]), 1000, dt=1).sum().item() for _ in range(2000)], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='poisson')\r\n```\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17203078/210660351-6429eb96-0c84-4811-9d78-11d4f59f2c5e.png\" width=\"50%\">\r\nNotice how the mean is the same, but the variance is different. \r\n\r\n\r\n600Hz\r\n```\r\nplt.hist([poisson2(600, 1000, dt=1, clip=False).sum().item() for _ in range(2000)], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='poisson2')\r\nplt.hist([poisson(torch.tensor([600]), 1000, dt=1).sum().item() for _ in range(2000)], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='poisson')\r\n```\r\nNotice how when not clipping the mean is precisely 600.

This doesn't look right to me. It means that in a second, with a 10Hz, you will get always either 9 or 10 spikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n50Hz, but with time=1 repeated 1000 times. This version didn't work at all with `econding.poisson`. Now, with `poisson2`,  this works:\r\n```\r\nl = []\r\nfor _ in range(1000):\r\n    l.append(poisson2(50, 1, dt=1).item())\r\nprint(np.sum(l)) => ~50 (correct!)\r\nl = []\r\nfor _ in range(1000):\r\n    l.append(poisson(torch.tensor([50.]), 1, dt=1).item())\r\nprint(np.sum(l)) => 0 (incorrect)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not claiming that `poisson2` is a `fixed` version of `encoding.poisson`.

However, you could potentially just copy and paste my `poisson2` function in your code and use it directly. That's used only for the input spikes anyway. \r\n\r\nI want to stress how my solution produces a more theoretically correct Poisson distribution - however, used in conjunction with the rest of BindsNET *it will still under-produce spikes*: if you set `clip=False` it will NOT under-produce spikes; however, in this case, I am almost sure the rest of the code will break (so you should always use the default `clip=True` when `poisson2` is used in conjunction with BindsNet. \r\n\r\nThis is why:\r\n`poisson2` returns the number of spikes for each dt. Let's say you use 10Hz, so a fairly low spiking rate. Most of the time each dt will have a spike of 0, sometime a spike of 1 and rarely a spike >1, e.g. let's say you end up with a spiking vector of `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]`.  However, the spiking vector is supposed to be a binary vector, and the behaviour for values >1 is undefined. That's why we should always clip values at maximum 1 spikes per dt (which would just return `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`. And that's why you will always have under-production of spikes, and why the problem becomes more noticeable for high spiking rates (that is: it's more likely that a dt will contain more than 1 spike). I don't think there is an obvious way to solve this. \r\n\r\nI hope that's clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/1381555952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ValerioB88","id":17203078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAzMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17203078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88","html_url":"https://github.com/ValerioB88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValerioB88/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8219079658,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBzWFSM5abcGtzwAAAAHp5TPq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/8219079658","actor":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-13T09:48:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8219079671,"node_id":"SE_lADOBzWFSM5abcGtzwAAAAHp5TP3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/8219079671","actor":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-13T09:48:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/1382489474","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/608#issuecomment-1382489474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/608","id":1382489474,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzWFSM5SZx2C","user":{"login":"rafaelblevin821","id":1954873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1954873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelblevin821","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelblevin821/received_events","type":"
