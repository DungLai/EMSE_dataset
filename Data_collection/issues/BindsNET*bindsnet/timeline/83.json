We haven't provided *any* guarantees about what it should do; it simply is an example of how BindsNET can be used.\r\n\r\nCheck out [this script](https://github.com/djsaunde/bindsnet_experiments/blob/master/scripts/mnist/diehl_and_cook_2015.py) for an example of how BindsNET's `network.save()` and `load_network()` functions can be used to save and load network objects. Notice that we also use `pickle` to dump certain \"auxiliary\" data (used for classification purposes) to disk as well.\r\n\r\nAs for testing with your own inputs, you can use the functions in the `encode` module to convert non-negative data into spike trains in a number of different ways.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/399089001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djsaunde","id":1245942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU5NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1245942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde","html_url":"https://github.com/djsaunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djsaunde/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1693542270,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY5MzU0MjI3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/1693542270","actor":{"login":"manjunaths","id":216373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths","html_url":"https://github.com/manjunaths","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-21T12:38:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1693542272,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2OTM1NDIyNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/events/1693542272","actor":{"login":"manjunaths","id":216373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths","html_url":"https://github.com/manjunaths","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-21T12:38:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/comments/399091936","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/83#issuecomment-399091936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/83","id":399091936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTA5MTkzNg==","user":{"login":"manjunaths","id":216373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths","html_url":"https://github.com/manjunaths","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manjunaths/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T12:49:38Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T12:49:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
