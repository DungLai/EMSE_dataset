inference has been proposed to divided into three parts, including feature extraction, deep neural network, posterior handling[1]. This framework has been adopted by many subsequent studies. In 2020, Google proposed KWS_ Streaming. Did this overturn the research published in 2014? \r\nBoth the research of 2014 and kws_streaming  can realize streaming inference.
