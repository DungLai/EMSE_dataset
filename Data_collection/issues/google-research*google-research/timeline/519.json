Thank you very much for explaining this problem to me, I have understood it.(it seems no problem in your training and package code).\r\nI have another question:\r\nThe output of the code seems to contain three parts: \"embedding mean\", \"embedding variance\", \"embedding samples\" (20 by default in the code). So in the test application stage, If I input 2D keypoints, which is the output really used for evaluation? Is it just to use \"embedding mean\" as the real output of the evaluation(like quantitative evaluation in other datasets, retrival, video alignment in paper)? I don't find an explanation in the paper.\r\nLooking forward to your reply.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/759175149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"horsetif","id":27015574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE1NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27015574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif","html_url":"https://github.com/horsetif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/760593695","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/519#issuecomment-760593695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/519","id":760593695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDU5MzY5NQ==","user":{"login":"jenjsun","id":40725770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzI1Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40725770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun","html_url":"https://github.com/jenjsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-15T01:59:14Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T01:59:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In our evaluation, we used the samples (20 samples based on the embedding mean and variance).
