The main reason that we stayed with 416x128\nis that we wanted to not change too many things at the same time, so that\nwe can study the effect of each change we made - occlusion-awareness,\nlearning intrinsics, pooling datasets etc. For getting the best depth\nprediction accuracy, I would definitely train at higher resolutions. We\ncould easily double the resolution (and have a batch size of 4 instead of\n16) and everything would still fit on a p100 or a v100 GPU and train.\n\nOn Fri, Oct 11, 2019 at 8:31 AM kwea123 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi @gariel-google <https://github.com/gariel-google>, are the models that\n> you provide trained on images 416x128?
