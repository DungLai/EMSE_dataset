We indeed use no strides in the encoder, so the encoded feature map is still 128x128 in size. Using some strides in the encoder generally works well, but downsampling too harshly tends to reduce performance (i.e. result quality) in my experience (7x7 might potentially be too coarse), at least for a very shallow/naive CNN. I suspect that a ResNet would still work well, though, despite the larger strides.\r\n\r\nThe illustration in the paper is just meant as an illustration of the idea, hence the 8x8 grid is only meant to show that these are encoded feature maps.\r\n\r\nAnd you are right in that the decoder starts with spatial broadcasting to a 8x8 grid, followed by several (de-)conv layers with strides > 1 to get back to 128x128 resolution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/773582230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tkipf","id":7347296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDcyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7347296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf","html_url":"https://github.com/tkipf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4401836689,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQwMTgzNjY4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4401836689","actor":{"login":"vadimkantorov","id":1041752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDE3NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1041752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov","html_url":"https://github.com/vadimkantorov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-03T12:49:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
