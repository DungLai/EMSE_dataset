We fixed it since in\nour internal version, but all the numbers we published in the paper were\nobtained with that code, and the checkpoints we released are compatible\nwith that (buggy) code. If we fix the code now, the checkpoints we\npublished will not reproduce the numbers in the paper.\n\nPerhaps we can publish the corrected version protected by a flag that will\nbe off by default?
