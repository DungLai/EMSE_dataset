When I tried to run KITTI images with the model trained on SceneFlow, results are very far from the ones of the table (I get EPE around 40). Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSergio","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/827429107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"serizba","id":23260036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjYwMDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23260036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba","html_url":"https://github.com/serizba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serizba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4649465587,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY0OTQ2NTU4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4649465587","actor":{"login":"vtankovich","id":74434832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDM0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74434832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich","html_url":"https://github.com/vtankovich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-27T08:40:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4649465593,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2NDk0NjU1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4649465593","actor":{"login":"vtankovich","id":74434832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDM0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74434832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich","html_url":"https://github.com/vtankovich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-27T08:40:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/827710671","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/613#issuecomment-827710671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/613","id":827710671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNzcxMDY3MQ==","user":{"login":"vtankovich","id":74434832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDM0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74434832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich","html_url":"https://github.com/vtankovich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtankovich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-27T15:44:04Z","updated_at":"2021

It seems that the model behaves significantly different now (even the plant is not as good as it should be) , compared to Dec 2020. Can you try running it with older versions of the libraries while I'm investigating this?

 thanks for your immediate reply.\r\n\r\nyou mean even the plant case is also not as good as previous result, and it might due to the different libraries.\r\n  \r\noh, I forget to mention that I use
