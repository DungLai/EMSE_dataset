think if you are using tensorflow, you should call tf.saver.save() to save the session.\r\n\r\n> I can't find how to save trained model.\r\n> I've seen TensorFlow recommenders have scann integrated in their models, and as such have similar saving process like:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> scann = tfrs.layers.factorized_top_k.ScaNN(model.user_model, num_reordering_candidates=1000)\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n>
