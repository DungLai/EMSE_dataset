In our [sampling code](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/tcc/datasets.py#L355) we always sample videos of the same class in one batch. That is in a single batch you would only have videos of one class. Hence, aligning them is fine. We do so by creating per-action datasets and sampling exactly batch_size number of elements from each dataset. In the experiments conducted in the paper, we trained a separate model for each action. Hence, we never aligned videos of different classes. Hope this clears things up.
