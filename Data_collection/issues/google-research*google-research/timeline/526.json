It looks like a bug, which I introduced two weeks ago. \r\nPlease replace \"framing_stride = max(flags.window_stride_samples, window_frame_overlap)\" by \"framing_stride = flags.window_stride_samples\".\r\nAbove fix with unit test will be merged in kws_streaming on Monday.\r\n\r\nAfter fix is applied, please retrain your model with additional flag: \r\n--ds_padding \"'causal', 'causal', 'causal', 'causal', 'causal', 'causal'\"\r\nCausal model can be converted to streaming mode out of the box in kws lib.\r\n\r\nIf a model uses 'same' padding - it is non causal padding (by default ds_tc_resnet uses ds_padding = 'same'). Such a mode can be streamed, but it has to be modified: delay layer has to be inserted in all residual connections and conv layers. Core layers to support this use case were implemented (an example of a model supporting both 'causal' and 'same' paddings is shown [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/layers/delay_test.py#L56)), but all models re-implementation was out of scope of the paper.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if it works for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/761298143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/763461924","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/526#issuecomment-763461924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/526","id":763461924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MzQ2MTkyNA==","user":{"login":"iamweiweishi","id":23145532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTQ1NTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23145532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi","html_url":"https://github.com/iamweiweishi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamweiweishi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-20T09:21:51Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T09:21:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you so much.
