Vadim, thanks a lot for your comment. We used 320 examples for evaluation, which IIRC were taken from the split right after the first 70k examples which we used for training. I verified that the results did not vary significantly based on the evaluation split (i.e. always stayed in the 98-99% range; this holds even when evaluating on samples from the training set). We chose 320 evaluation examples to stay in line with IODINE, but to be safe I'd recommend taking a larger evaluation split in future experiments.\r\n\r\nI think your discrepancy comes from training on a different dataset (the non-DeepMind version of CLEVR) and then trying to transfer to CLEVR w/ masks (i.e. DeepMind's version). We remarked in the Readme that this is not advisable since dataset statistics appear to differ between the two datasets (e.g. object scale, camera position etc.).
