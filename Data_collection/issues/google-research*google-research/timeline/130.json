I am sorry for the delayed response. Regarding loading the\nimagene checkpoint, I admit that I am not 100% sure how to import it from\nthe pytorch checkpoint, but perhaps this code\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/struct2depth/util.py#L215\ncan\nprovide a clue? These seems to be some special treatment there for the\nbatchnorm variables. Unfortunately I do not have access to the code that\nwas used to import the imagenet checkpoint, and I m not a pytorch user\nmyself, so I am sorry that I cannot help more.\n\nRegarding the training getting stuck - could you explain more? Does it\ncrash? Or just hangs?

Issue #162  is about this problem. There is an important bug in CUDA 10.0, and the related tensorflow 1.x (x>=13.1) binaries are built with CUDA 10.0. We built tensorflow 14.0 with CUDA 10.1. It works that way.
