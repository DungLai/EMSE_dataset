What I see is that the mean absolute error is pretty small which is great. My guess is that the small fraction of larger values of absolute error (most of the values are concentrated around 0) correspond also to larger values that are being approximated. Also take into account that the computational block includes renormalization so it is not purely an approximation of the linear transformation of the attention matrix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/750405412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchoro","id":24759686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU5Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24759686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro","html_url":"https://github.com/kchoro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchoro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4145028921,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE0NTAyODkyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4145028921","actor":{"login":"mschoeler","id":3592251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTIyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3592251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoeler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-23T17:45:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4145028924,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNDUwMjg5MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4145028924","actor":{"login":"mschoeler","id":3592251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTIyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3592251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoeler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-23T17:45:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/750424103","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/503#issuecomment-750424103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/503","id":750424103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDQyNDEwMw==","user":{"login":"mschoeler","id":3592251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTIyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3592251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoeler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoeler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-23T18:37:53Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T18:37:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks

Yes, we will definitely add this test to the open-sourced version. We have it in our internal codebase and as you noticed, indeed the error is even smaller if we focus only on the attention matrix.

And by the way, we have just updated open-sourced version to measure absolute rather than relative error in the unit test.
