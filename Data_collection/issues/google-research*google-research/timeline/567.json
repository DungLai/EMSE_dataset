I think any form of residual or gated update should be much better and more stable than a direct replacement. So it is quite likely that the momentum update you suggested would work well, too.\r\n\r\nAs for more iterations: if you go far beyond 5 or so iterations you might benefit a lot from applying intermediate loss terms, like we do in one of the experiments in the appendix. This generally improves stability as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/796639432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tkipf","id":7347296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDcyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7347296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf","html_url":"https://github.com/tkipf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkipf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
