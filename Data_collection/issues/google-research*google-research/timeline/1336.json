For faster responses you can either tag me using @charlesjin, or just email me directly at ccj@csail.mit.edu\r\n\r\nRegarding your question, each config contains a graph which can be executed as a JAX model using the abstract_nas.model.Model class.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our codebase only provides support for native JAX training and inference.\r\n\r\nYou could always convert our models to Tensorflow manually by inspecting the ops in the graph, and then reimplement the model in Tensorflow. If you have questions about interpreting the graph representation, feel free to follow up with me.\r\n\r\nThere also appear to be some tools that would do this for you automatically (e.g., jax2tf in jax.experimental might be what you're looking for), but I have no experience with them.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/1338968367/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"charlesjin","id":4011668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTE2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4011668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesjin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7963930945,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQmIhc5VrWtuzwAAAAHar_FB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/7963930945","actor":{"login":"charlesjin","id":4011668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTE2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4011668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesjin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-06T08:39:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7963930950,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQmIhc5VrWtuzwAAAAHar_FG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/7963930950","actor":{"login":"charlesjin","id":4011668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTE2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4011668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesjin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesjin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-06T08:39:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/1342433330","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/1336#issuecomment-1342433330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1336","id":1342433330,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQmIhc5QA-gy","user":{"login":"haimin777","id":18635602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjM1NjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18635602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777","html_url":"https://github.com/haimin777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haimin777/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-08T10:10:33Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T10:10:33Z","author_association"
