far my conclusion is that PyTorch's nn.LayerNorm does not perform the LayerNorm (as pictured in GroupNorm paper), and is quite hard to coerce to do so, since it requires static `normalized_shape` and blocks dynamic spatial/temporal batch sizes. TensorFlow is much more flexible and just asks the user to supply the list of dimensions to normalize over.\r\n\r\nHowever, by default TF also does not do LayerNorm.
