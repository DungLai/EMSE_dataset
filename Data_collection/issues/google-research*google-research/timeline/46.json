We are\nplanning to release a pretrained KITTI checkpoint in the next few days, and\na first step can be establishing that we agree on how eval metrics are\ncalculated. We can both run evals on the same checkpoint and exchange\nresults. Based on that, we'll see how to proceed. How does that sound?\n\nOn Sun, Aug 18, 2019 at 8:12 AM juju <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Thanks for the reply.\n>\n> Yes, for depth inference, I am using the link\n> <https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/depth_from_video_in_the_wild/model.py#L388>\n> you mentioned in your previous comment.\n>\n> In Figure 5 of the paper, for *Evaluated on KITTI*, the training\n> converges at around 1 million training images.

much @liyingliu for testing the checkpoints so quickly. I am happy\nthat we are getting the exact same result on depth prediction.\nRegarding the batch size, we tested at 1. If batch-normalization is\nreplaced everywhere by randomized layer normalization, the inference\nresults do not depend on the batch size, as it should be. Due to an\noversight, when we were obtaining the results for the paper, we left a few\nbatch normalization layers in place. We fixed that since, but to be\ncompatible with the checkpoints used for the paper, we needed to leave the\nbatch-norms there, hence the dependence on the batch size.\n\nRegarding odometry, there may be a few explanations to that:\n1. We used a more mature checkpoint for odometry, which seemed to converge\nslower than depth prediction.\n2. We used inference time correction for the intrinsics (even though the\nresult you're showing seems worse than even our uncorrected one).\n3. There might be a difference in the way we stack the rotations and\ntranslations together to obtain a trajectory - this is a bit tricky.\n\nWe can debug odometry together by us releasing the checkpoints used for\nodometry and the respective inferred trajectories.\n\nAt this time I would like to ask you what you would like to prioritize -\ngetting the code and checkpoint for imagenet initialization, so that you\ncan reproduce the training, or getting the odometry evaluation right?\nPlease let me know which one you prefer and I'll start there. It will take\nat least a few days, in any case.\n\nThank you again for your help in debugging this.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 22, 2019 at 7:08 PM juju <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi @gariel-google <https://github.com/gariel-google>, thanks for the\n> work.
