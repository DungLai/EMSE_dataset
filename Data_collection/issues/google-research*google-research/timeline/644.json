So if it is convenient for you guys to supply the final `crawled_instructions.json` file? That will help a lot of people who have situations like me.\r\n\r\nhi，Is this problem solved? I’m currently studying the paper Mapping-Natural-Language-Instructions-to-Mobile-UI-Action-Sequences. I guess you are too. Can you leave an email?
