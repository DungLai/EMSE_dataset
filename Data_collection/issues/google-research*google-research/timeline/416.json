To generate frm_1 we need prev_0 and next_1 shown below:\r\n```\r\n        32.ms(frm_0)      \r\n<--------------------->\r\n              prev_0    next_1\r\n           <---------><--------->\r\n                   32ms (frm_1)\r\n           <--------------------->\r\n```\r\nLength of next_1 = 16ms is 256 samples - this is the input shape in streaming mode.\r\nWe get prev_0 from frm_0, by taking last 256 samples and then concatenate is with next_1 and get frm_1 = concat(prev_0, next_1).\r\nNow we can repeat this process for next iteration.\r\n[data_frame](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/layers/data_frame.py) keeps the state of the previous frame and manages framing automatically for you, so you just need to feed the new update data with size 256 samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n**For the case when preprocess=mfcc or preprocess=micro**\r\nModel will receive mfcc features as input, so the input shape in streaming mode will be dct_num_features as shown in [link] (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/layers/modes.py#L69)\r\nIn this case framing and speech feature extraction will happen outside of the model and you will need to manage it by yourself.\r\n\r\nThank you for evaluating kws lib! please let me know if you have more questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/707274960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3867798121,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg2Nzc5ODEyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/3867798121","actor":{"login":"LeeYongHyeok","id":39906282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTA2Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39906282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok","html_url":"https://github.com/LeeYongHyeok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-12T18:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3867798125,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4Njc3OTgxMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/3867798125","actor":{"login":"LeeYongHyeok","id":39906282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTA2Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39906282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok","html_url":"https://github.com/LeeYongHyeok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-12T18:19:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/707417149","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/416#issuecomment-707417149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/416","id":707417149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzQxNzE0OQ==","user":{"login":"LeeYongHyeok","id":39906282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTA2Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39906282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok","html_url":"https://github.com/LeeYongHyeok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeYongHyeok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created
