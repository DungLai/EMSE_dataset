The paper states: ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{steps}} \\eta_b[i]M_{b,j}[i]} {\\sum_{j=1}^{D}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{steps}} \\eta_b[i]M_{b,j}[i]}) But the give code is: (line 182) `aggregated_mask_values += mask_values * scale_agg` Inside a for looping over each step, which will give only the top part of the equation.\r\n> \r\n> Am I missing something or the paper and code are really different?\r\n\r\nHello,as the README.md said,I use `python -m test_experiment_covertype.py` for simple test,but its result is obviously wrong,The traing loss and val accuracy are irregular,just because it's  in the low-resource environment?How can I fix this problem?\r\n![KH HVLC(7N@1KB$A@Y%FBDF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41032255/139565232-955f7e1f-b1e8-41bf-b6ac-4df88770aa7b.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/955628299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yhkll","id":41032255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDMyMjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41032255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll","html_url":"https://github.com/yhkll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhkll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5544697110,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQmIhc42CHkxzwAAAAFKfV0W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5544697110","actor":{"login":"soarik","id":55108645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTA4NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55108645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik","html_url":"https://github.com/soarik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-31T03:03:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5544697112,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQmIhc42CHkxzwAAAAFKfV0Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5544697112","actor":{"login":"soarik","id":55108645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTA4NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55108645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik","html_url":"https://github.com/soarik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-31T03:03:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
