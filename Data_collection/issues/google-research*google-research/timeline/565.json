@expectopatronum for the lag in reply - this is a shared repo for research open source code so notifications can sometimes get lost in the noise. Great to hear of your interest using ROAR. Yes, you are correct in your interpretation of the rescale_image code, this rescales the range of values between [0,1]. Thus, the minimum possible attribution becomes 0 and the maximum is 1. The overall ranking remains the same.   \r\n\r\n I'll close this for now -- but if you have any other questions do reach out by tagging our github handles or by sending a message to the email address listed on the paper.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/793281352/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sarahooker","id":12467272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDY3Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12467272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker","html_url":"https://github.com/sarahooker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahooker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4424761528,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQyNDc2MTUyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4424761528","actor":{"login":"expectopatronum","id":2265475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjU0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2265475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum","html_url":"https://github.com/expectopatronum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-09T02:27:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4424761529,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MjQ3NjE1Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4424761529","actor":{"login":"expectopatronum","id":2265475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjU0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2265475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum","html_url":"https://github.com/expectopatronum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expectopatronum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-09T02:27:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
