Under modify I mean add intrinsic as a property to the model class, take the returned values from `motion_prediction_net.motion_field_net`, and assign it later as `self.intrinsics = 0.5 * (mat + inv_mat)`. \r\n\r\nYou can later get this value by adding a method to the model class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def inference_intrinsics(self, image1, image2, sess):\r\n        return sess.run([self.intrinsics],\r\n                        feed_dict={\r\n                            self._image1: image1,\r\n                            self._image2: image2\r\n                        })\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/803859788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"VladimirYugay","id":12258972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjU4OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12258972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay","html_url":"https://github.com/VladimirYugay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirYugay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
