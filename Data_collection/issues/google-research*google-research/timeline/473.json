The `tf-addons` package has the same issue and [here's what they said about it](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons#c-custom-op-compatibility). We would be more than happy to build ScaNN wheels for TF 2.4 (once it's released, it's still in RC status) but there wouldn't be a good way to distribute the wheels--I don't think pip has a mechanism for \"install version A of this package if you have version X of TensorFlow, and install version B of this package if you have version Y of TensorFlow.\"\r\n\r\nCan you clarify more about compatibility with the GPU versions of TF? From what I understand, the GPU version of TF is no longer a separate package, so there really isn't a distinction between GPU and non-GPU TF anymore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/735950793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sammymax","id":6895661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTU2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6895661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax","html_url":"https://github.com/sammymax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/735988248","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/473#issuecomment-735988248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/473","id":735988248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTk4ODI0OA==","user":{"login":"SmileTM","id":19524544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTI0NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19524544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM","html_url":"https://github.com/SmileTM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmileTM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-30T19:19:37Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T19:19:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think you should change pip `requirements.txt`.  \r\nWhen pip install scann , it will uninstall tf2.x-gpu,  then install tf-2.x .
