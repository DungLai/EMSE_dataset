Thanks for the clear explanations!\r\nApplied to Q: Line 102 makes Q', but when calculating attention later, Q' is also in the denominator, so it doesn't affect the result.\r\nBTW, I think line 106 also not affecting the results. We are using the maximum value of all elements(specifically, along `axis=last_dims_t + attention_dims_t`) in the `data_dash` tensor.  And K' is also in the denominator(Q'((K')T1)) when calculating attention later. \r\nAm I mistaken?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/873425350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wcshin-git","id":76698585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Njk4NTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76698585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git","html_url":"https://github.com/wcshin-git","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcshin-git/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4974313092,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk3NDMxMzA5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4974313092","actor":{"login":"jw9730","id":41632241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjMyMjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41632241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730","html_url":"https://github.com/jw9730","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-03T15:38:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4974313093,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5NzQzMTMwOTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4974313093","actor":{"login":"jw9730","id":41632241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjMyMjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41632241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730","html_url":"https://github.com/jw9730","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw9730/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-03T15:38:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
