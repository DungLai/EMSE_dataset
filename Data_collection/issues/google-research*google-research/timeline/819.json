Streaming and non-streaming latency with accuracy\". If you train RNN based model with default settings (CRNN is based on RNN) then it resets RNN state at every minibatch and trained in \"stateless\" mode - this model can not be used for streaming, because it expects that RNN state is reseted in the beginning of the input sequence, but in the streaming mode we do not know when is the beginning of the key word in the input audio sequence. That is why for streaming mode, RNN based model, have to be trained in \"statefull\" mode as shown in [crnn_state](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/experiments/kws_experiments_paper_12_labels.md#crnn_state). In this case you should expect that overall accuracy of CRNN model can go down: as shown in \"Table 2: Accuracy on data V2 with latency and model size\" in comparison to non streaming version in \"Table 1: Baseline models accuracy on data V1* and V2* with paper references and our models accuracy on data V1 and V2\" of the paper. For streaming mode model has to learn on its own how to process RNN state.\r\n\r\nNon streaming accuracy reported at \"Table 1: Baseline models accuracy on data V1* and V2* with\r\npaper references and our models accuracy on data V1 and V2\" can be reproduced by running [crnn](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/experiments/kws_experiments_paper_12_labels.md#crnn). This model can be used for non streaming inference. You can use it in streaming mode, but you will have to reset manually RNN state in the beginning of the key word, so it is very limited use case because you will need to design a beginning of the key word detector and connect it with CRNN etc - it is not end to end approach.\r\n\r\nStreaming accuracy reported at \"Table 2: Accuracy on data V2 with latency and model size\" can be reproduced by [crnn_state](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/experiments/kws_experiments_paper_12_labels.md#crnn_state). This model can be used for both streaming and non streaming inference.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/922006887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/922465239","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/819#issuecomment-922465239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/819","id":922465239,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQmIhc42-7PX","user":{"login":"vishalkevat007","id":29162378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTYyMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29162378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007","html_url":"https://github.com/vishalkevat007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-19T12:21:56Z","updated_at":"2021-09-19T12:21:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ohkay,
