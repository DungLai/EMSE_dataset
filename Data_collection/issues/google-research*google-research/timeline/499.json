there, thanks for your question. Sorry about that - I didn't realize that the generated `pb2`, `py_pb2`, and `py_pb2_grpc` files wouldn't automatically get sent to this public repository. In Google's internal repository, I have a Bazel \"BUILD\" file defining how the system should build extra libraries from the first_order.proto:\r\n```\r\nproto_library(\r\n    name = \"first_order_proto\",\r\n    srcs = [\"first_order.proto\"],\r\n    has_services = 1,\r\n    cc_api_version = 2,\r\n)\r\n\r\npy_proto_library(\r\n    name = \"first_order_py_pb2\",\r\n    has_services = 1,\r\n    api_version = 2,\r\n    deps = [\":first_order_proto\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\ngoogle3_py_grpc_library(\r\n    name = \"first_order_py_pb2_grpc\",\r\n    srcs = [\":first_order_proto\"],\r\n    deps = [\":first_order_py_pb2\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use the exact same setup with protos I have, you should generate the libraries using GRPC library, e.g. see [an example here](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/issues/42).\r\n\r\nHowever, these proto definitions are only really useful if you're using GRPC as a way of communication - If you're using a different API to allow the client to communicate with the servers, then you probably don't need any of this and maybe can modify the code to directly use e.g. dictionaries instead of protos as messages.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/748990710/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xingyousong","id":7622839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjI4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7622839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong","html_url":"https://github.com/xingyousong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/749392337","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/499#issuecomment-749392337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/499","id":749392337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTM5MjMzNw==","user":{"login":"TigerStone93","id":46550846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTUwODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46550846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93","html_url":"https://github.com/TigerStone93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TigerStone93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-22T07:27:39Z","updated_at":"2020-12-22T07:30:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Maybe I understood your advise properly and finally generated pb2.py and pb2_grpc.py\r\n\r\n[The link](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/issues/42) that you give provides useful information but it is a little bit out-of-date.\r\n\r\nSo the command below doesn't work.\r\n`$ protoc -I=./ --python_out=./ --grpc_out=./ --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=``which grpc_python_plugin`` ./first_order.proto`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I refered [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34713861/python-grpc-protobuf-stubs-generation-issue-grpc-out-protoc-gen-grpc-plugin).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, commands below work.\r\n```\r\n$ pip install protobuf\r\n$ pip install grpcio-tools==1.32\r\n$ pip install googleapis-common-protos\r\n\r\n$ python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. first_order.proto\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for the reply, @xingyousong!

the `urdf_root=FLAGS.urdf_data_path`, you can eliminate that FLAGS; sorry it was used internally for robotics applications and I forgot to delete. I'll update with a followup push later on.\r\n\r\nFor the `loas2` and `ports=...` parts, I'm importing the `grpc` from an internal library, but this library has been pushed to open-source here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc. I think some of the functions though like `loas2` are google specific (which simply returns my Google user-name for credentialing for secure connections). For `ports...`, it tells the locations that the aggregator client should connect to. \r\n\r\nI'll also edit the followup CL with hopefully the correct way to use GRPC outside of Google. I'm following the examples here: https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/basics/\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I believe what should be done are:\r\n- Delete `ports=` arguments from `futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`\r\n-  Also use `server.add_insecure_port` and `grpc.insecure_channel` which don't need credentialing (and thus removes `loas2`)\r\n\r\nAnyways, these implementations are optimized for Google-specific networking; if there's a better method to do client-server connecting on e.g. Cloud instances, you should use that framework instead.\r\n\r\nEDIT: here's the new update: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/commit/1142ddee3db18c190d3e628f1dc443225665ff26","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/750299556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xingyousong","id":7622839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjI4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7622839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong","html_url":"https://github.com/xingyousong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyousong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
