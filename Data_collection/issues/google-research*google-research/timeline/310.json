It is implemented based on DFT and uses only basic ops such as matrix matrix multiplication.\r\n5 mfcc_op is implemented based on FFT. It is a special op in TFLite. This feature extractor can be part of the model (set by preprocess 'raw'; feature_type 'mfcc_op') or it can be outside of the model (set by preprocess 'mfcc';). In both cases it is the same TFLite op and if it works for one case it will work for another too. I never tested it on CoreML/iOS. Please feel free to try it and let me know if you have any problems. If it does not work we can create an issue for TFLite team.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/648884809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/648887394","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/310#issuecomment-648887394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/310","id":648887394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODg4NzM5NA==","user":{"login":"entn-at","id":10227168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI3MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10227168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at","html_url":"https://github.com/entn-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T15:21:05Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T15:21:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
