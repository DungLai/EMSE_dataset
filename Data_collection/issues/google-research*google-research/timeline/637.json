For example, suppose that I have a dataset of point clouds with the related labels. (Eg Semantic Kitti dataset) and I just want to exploit the modules for 3D sparse convolutions, or the U-Net semantic segmentation model which are the core functions that are useful to try. How should I prepare my dataset? How can I build a simple model to train and test the semantic segmentation results? An `helloworld` example would be fantastic!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/803624404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FrancescoMandru","id":43784964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzg0OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43784964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru","html_url":"https://github.com/FrancescoMandru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
