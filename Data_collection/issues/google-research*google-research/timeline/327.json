@rybakov  Sorry, that must be a instant dumb thought. But now there may be one thing worth noted, [Matchboxnet (when the paper was out, there was only `labels_full`)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/asr/conf/matchboxnet_3x1x64_v1.yaml) seems that they achieved 97+ accuracy with 30/35 class(and the model size is below 100k!)? I doubt if accuracy would be better with more class or more complex words. If not, then it could achieve higher accuracy with 12 class. I think it's worth trying and am now trying to implement Matchboxnet with kws_streaming framework, but fail so far unfortunately.

Matchbox model is based on [jasper model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03288.pdf). In the [link](https://nvidia.github.io/OpenSeq2Seq/html/speech-commands.html#jasper-10x3) they showed that for data sets v1, test accuracy on 12 labels (v1-12) is 96.6% and on 30 labels (v1-30) is 97.3%. So in this case test accuracy on 30 labels is higher than on 12 labels (in our paper we use v1-12 and v2-12 configs), I guess on other model it can be opposite.\r\n\r\nTo validate Matchbox, you can to re-train it with v1-12 config: \r\n* set labels parameters in model config matchboxnet_3x1x64_v2.yaml as:   \r\n  labels: ${model.labels_subset}\r\n* specify \"class_split=\"sub\" \" when you run process_speech_commands_data.py in  [nemo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/asr/03_Speech_Commands.ipynb), set 200 epochs.\r\n\r\nComments about v1-12 and v1-30 data configs: \r\n* v1-12 config has \"unknown\" label which contains mixture of different labels from remaining 20 labels - it can make it harder to learn; (v1-30 config does not have \"unknown\" label);\r\n* you should also check the amount of training samples per label in v1-12 and v1-30 configs (it can make a difference in accuracy too).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/694673139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3781061927,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc4MTA2MTkyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/3781061927","actor":{"login":"tu1258","id":59950011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTUwMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59950011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258","html_url":"https://github.com/tu1258","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-18T06:02:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3781061933,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3ODEwNjE5MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/3781061933","actor":{"login":"tu1258","id":59950011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTUwMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59950011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258","html_url":"https://github.com/tu1258","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-18T06:02:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/695075424","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/327#issuecomment-695075424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/327","id":695075424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTA3NTQyNA==","user":{"login":"tu1258","id":59950011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTUwMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59950011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258","html_url":"https://github.com/tu1258","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-18T20:39:40Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T20:39:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks

Instead, I experiment separable conv with TC Resnet and group conv with TC Resnet. Here are some results.\r\n\r\n  | Data1 | Data2 | Param | Parents | Description\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nV2.0 | 96.03 | 96.05 | 27K | V1.1 | 7x36   layer\r\nV2.1 | 94.5 | 95.02 | 11K | V2.0 | 7x36   layer, 3 group\r\nV2.2 | 95.44 | 95.44 | 12K | V2.0 | Mobile TCN\r\nV2.3 | 94.95 | 95.09 | 12K | V2.2 | Mobile   TCN+Resnet\r\nV2.4 | 93.5 | 93.6 | 6K | V2.0 | 5x20   layer\r\nV2.5 | 93.88 | 94.18 | 6K | V2.0 | 7x36   layer, 6 group\r\nV2.6 | 94.3 | 94.22 | 4.5K | V2.2 | Kernel 5x1, 5x24\r\nV2.7 | 93.68 | 94.43 | 4.5K | V2.6 | Kernel   5x1, 5x24 + Resnet\r\n\r\nTo make it clear, the network shapes are at below. The resnet didn't use pointwise convolution because of abundant computation and no accuracy improvement in my own experiment. I just add the previous layer(previous two like the original resnet paper) with same shape and accuracy is worse unfortunately. The group convolution is just setting the group in `tf.keras.layer.conv2D`. In addition, since I would like to try \"group pointwise convolution + depthwise convolution\", I didn't just use \"separable convolution\" to implement mobilenet version of TCN.\r\n\r\n\r\n>

Dude why do you do this to me lol. Last week I was planning to stop tuning and ready to implement it on hardware chip(this is my major research) but you just keep reporting some awesome models. Don't get me wrong. I am not mad at all and am glad to try it! Thanks! \r\nBtw, I have two question here. First, spec_aug seems don't help for lightweight model. It may solve overfitting but overfitting rarely occur in lightweight model. How about your case? Second, I found that the `get_data` function in `input_data.py` actually fetch random data in training set. I wonder if you have tried training the full training set. I think in the end it doesn't affect much but a 0~0.5% improvement may be reasonable? Or maybe converge more efficiently? I've tried but the results are slightly better so that I can't tell if it's just luck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/706386164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tu1258","id":59950011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTUwMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59950011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258","html_url":"https://github.com/tu1258","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
