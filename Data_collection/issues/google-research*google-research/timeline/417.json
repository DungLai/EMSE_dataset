Since the images reconstructed from `predicted_keypoints` are not used during training, they are not computed in this code. But it is very easy to get them. Simply add\r\n```\r\n  reconstructed_images_pred = keypoints_to_images_net([\r\n      predicted_keypoints,\r\n      input_images[:, 0, Ellipsis],\r\n      observed_keypoints[:, 0, Ellipsis]])\r\n```\r\nbelow [this line](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/video_structure/train.py#L79), and add `reconstructed_images_pred` as one of the model outputs.\r\n\r\nAnd if you already have a trained model, you can dig through the sub-modules of the Keras model object to find the \"vision\" part of the model (defined [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/video_structure/vision.py#L105)) and feed it the `predicted_keypoints` to reconstruct the corresponding images.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/707555535/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mjlm","id":5418069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTgwNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5418069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm","html_url":"https://github.com/mjlm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjlm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/710066123","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/417#issuecomment-710066123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/417","id":710066123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMDA2NjEyMw==","user":{"login":"Berndinio","id":32815508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODE1NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32815508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio","html_url":"https://github.com/Berndinio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berndinio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-16T14:01:06Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T14:01:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
