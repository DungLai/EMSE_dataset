Can you try creating a new Conda environment using these alternative instructions?\r\n> \r\n> * Delete the old environment: `conda env remove -n contrastive_rl`\r\n> * Download [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/files/9033178/requirements.txt)\r\n> * `conda create -n contrastive_rl python=3.9 -y`\r\n> * `conda activate contrastive_rl`\r\n> * `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps`\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply. I reinstalled the conda environment following your instructions, but still the same problem...
