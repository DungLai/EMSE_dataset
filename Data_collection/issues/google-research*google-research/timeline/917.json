@hassanhub. I have some problem with DMVR.\r\n\r\nI followed the [dmvr example](https://github.com/deepmind/dmvr/tree/master/examples) to generate the dataset.\r\nAnd changed the corresponding code so the code can read the correct path of data.\r\n\r\nBut when I run the vatt evaluation process, it would raise following error:\r\n\r\n> tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: 3 root error(s) found.\r\n>   (0) INVALID_ARGUMENT:  Name: <unknown>, Key: image/encoded, Index: 0.
