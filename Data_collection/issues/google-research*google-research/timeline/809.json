Thanks again! You have always helped me extra mile :)\r\nYes, the difference is in the flag parameter that might have caused the varying results. I am going to use the models generated post model training and will re-implement part of inference.py in c++ as suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/917221075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"srewai","id":32038717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDM4NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32038717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai","html_url":"https://github.com/srewai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5286609218,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQmIhc464oROzwAAAAE7G0FC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5286609218","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-10T21:24:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5286609221,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQmIhc464oROzwAAAAE7G0FF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5286609221","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-10T21:24:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/921560761","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/809#issuecomment-921560761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/809","id":921560761,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQmIhc427ea5","user":{"login":"srewai","id":32038717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDM4NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32038717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai","html_url":"https://github.com/srewai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T07:20:36Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T07:24:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

Here, I want to use the phonetic segmentation of the `--ẁanted_word hey babuni` to be treated as  UNKNOWN_WORD_LABEL so that the model is more robust to avoid false positives. So all the contents of the folder `other` are individual sounds (phonetic segmentation) of `ẁanted word hey babuni` which means these are *not* the list of my wanted words but I want the model to learn them as  UNKNOWN_WORD_LABEL. \r\n\r\nQ.1. Is this a good approach for a robust model to avoid false positives, please suggest?\r\nQ.2  I still want to have 3 output labels, or there is a better approach: \r\n\r\n'hey babuni'\r\n“silence”\r\n“unknown” (all individual sounds, phonetic segmentation).\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/922837913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"srewai","id":32038717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDM4NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32038717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai","html_url":"https://github.com/srewai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
