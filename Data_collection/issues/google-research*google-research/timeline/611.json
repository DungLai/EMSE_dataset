This is described in Section 4.3 of our paper and here are the steps you can take to do action recognition:\r\n1. There is no additional training of the embedding model (Pr-VIPE).\r\n2. We compute Pr-VIPE embeddings on the detected pose from each video frame in Penn Action. To be more precise, we used detected poses given the person boxes provided by the Penn Action and for frames without any given box (box is missing), we smear a box from a closest frame.\r\n3. The frame matching distance for a pair of frames i, j is the the neg log of the averaged matching probability of frames (i-6, i-3, i, i+3, i+6) and (j-6, j-3, j, j+3, j+6), of each corresponding frame pair\r\n4. Use DTW to align two videos using frame matching distance, and the nearest neighbor is the video with the smallest averaged distance  after alignment\r\n5. Do action classification of an unlabelled video by finding the nearest neighbor of a labelled video using the procedure above\r\nThere are additional implementation details in the Supplementary Materials (Section B), in particular, we use the standard protocol defined in https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Nie_Joint_Action_Recognition_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf to split the dataset.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/793307644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jenjsun","id":40725770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzI1Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40725770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun","html_url":"https://github.com/jenjsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/793905546","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/611#issuecomment-793905546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/611","id":793905546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MzkwNTU0Ng==","user":{"login":"yuan0101213","id":40485616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDg1NjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40485616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213","html_url":"https://github.com/yuan0101213","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-09T13:34:30Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T13:34:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your reply .

Can you please elaborate alittle bit more...\r\nThanks and much appreciated

Thanks and much appreciated\r\n\r\nAccording to the paper, I use compute_gaussian_likelihoods. The author also gave me some suggestions. Finally, I used acompute_gaussian_likelihoods.The following are the author's suggestions：\r\nHi Ducheng,\r\n\r\nThe `compute_gaussian_likelihoods` function is not what we used in the paper. I recommend referring to Eq 5 in our paper for how the matching probability p(m|z_i, z_j) between two embeddings z_i and z_j are computed. You can refer to this function for how the matching probability computed:\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/678de1febc782cd76e75e9591fa3b5b9687b083c/poem/core/loss_utils.py#L70\r\n\r\nOnce you have the matching probability, the distance is simply -log p(m|z_i, z_j).\r\n\r\nYou can also directly use the L2 distance between the embedding means of the two predicted Gaussians (\"unnormalized_embeddings.csv\"), which should also work is much simpler.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/930022033/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yuan0101213","id":40485616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDg1NjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40485616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213","html_url":"https://github.com/yuan0101213","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5379488412,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQmIhc4xHrPizwAAAAFApHqc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5379488412","actor":{"login":"yuan0101213","id":40485616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDg1NjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40485616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213","html_url":"https://github.com/yuan0101213","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-29T09:48:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5379488416,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQmIhc4xHrPizwAAAAFApHqg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5379488416","actor":{"login":"yuan0101213","id":40485616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDg1NjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40485616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213","html_url":"https://github.com/yuan0101213","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuan0101213/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-29T09:49:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/930058515","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/611#issuecomment-930058515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/611","id":930058515,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQmIhc43b5ET","user":{"login":"farazBhatti","id":37732181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzMyMTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37732181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti","html_url":"https://github.com/farazBhatti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farazBhatti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"create
