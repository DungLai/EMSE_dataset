Here train is called with num_steps=5 and so your training finishes quickly. For the paper, we trained with num_steps=5000000 but the model usually converges much earlier, so you could use num_steps=1000000.\r\n- You seem to have a bash syntax error based on the line \"script.sh: 37: script.sh: [[: not found\". This seem to occur when run.sh is checking for the existence of the checkpoint files. (You can also check this manually by seeing if the files are in /tmp/e3d/train)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/721370713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jenjsun","id":40725770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzI1Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40725770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun","html_url":"https://github.com/jenjsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/721463327","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/449#issuecomment-721463327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/449","id":721463327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTQ2MzMyNw==","user":{"login":"Brave-peng","id":31795256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzk1MjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31795256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng","html_url":"https://github.com/Brave-peng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brave-peng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-04T01:35:05Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T01:35:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Very very thank you!\r\n\r\n-now, I change my num_steps and get a good result!\r\n\r\n-I have checked /tmp/e3d/train, the checkpoint files is existing.
