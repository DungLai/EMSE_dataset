The following is work in progress and copy pasted from my current tests, so it is not nice code or a nice implementation, hard coded paths ... \r\nBut it may help you.\r\n\r\n### Relevant for inference\r\n[My Fork of the Repo with changes for testing purposes](https://github.com/PhilippSchmaelzle/mono_depth/tree/inference_with_original_code_structure)\r\n\r\nI did there training specific changes so the training would run with my image data.

It is possible to define the supported version as label.\r\nThis is necessary to fit the *Serving* framework to the underlaying versions of TensorFlow, CUDA and cudnn.\r\n**Version numbers and pull tags can be looked up here:\r\n[Version Release Info](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/releases \"Release Version Info\"), \r\n[Docker Pull Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/serving/tags/?page=1&ordering=last_updated \"Docker Version Pull Tags\")**\r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n```\r\n// Nuvo PC, Ubuntu 16.04.,TensorFlow 1.1.0, CUDA 10.0, cudnn 7\r\nsudo docker pull tensorflow/serving:1.15.0-gpu\r\n\r\n// Ubuntu 20.04., TensorFlow 2.2.o, NO GPU\r\nsudo docker pull tensorflow/serving:2.2.0\r\n```\r\nNow a runnable Docker image for TensorFlow Serving is available.\r\nThe easiest but also inflexible way of usage (which is enough for this use case) will be described within [Example Usage](#example-usage \"Example Usage\")\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\nTo do inference on raw images, the previously pulled Docker image needs to be run. \r\nTherefore, the following command can be used.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// CPU\r\nsudo docker run -p 8500:8500 --mount type=bind,source=<PATH_TO_SAVED_MODEL_STRUCT__MODEL_NAME>,target=/models/<MODEL_NAME> -e MODEL_NAME=<MODEL_NAME> -t tensorflow/serving:2.2.0 &\r\n\r\n// GPU\r\nsudo docker run --runtime=nvidia -p 8500:8500 --mount type=bind,source=PATH_TO_SAVED_MODEL_STRUCT__MODEL_NAME>,target=/models/<MODEL_NAME> -e MODEL_NAME=<MODEL_NAME> -t  tensorflow/serving:2.2.0-gpu &\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mounted directory needs to fulfill the TensorFlow *SavedModel* structure.\r\n- `ModelName`: Directories name defines the model name\r\n- `Model Versioning`: Subdirectories names **have to** be integer number. (No need to start with 0 or increments of one). \r\nThis gives the chance to have a model history. TensorFlow Serving will automatically start the latest/highest if no other version\r\n  is defined.\r\n- `saved_model.pb` and `variables`: output of [SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model \"SavedModel Guide\")\r\n```\r\n|-- ModelName\r\n|    |\r\n|    |-- 0 \r\n|    |-- 1\r\n|    |-- ...\r\n|    |-- N\r\n|    |    |-- saved_model.pb\r\n|    |    |-- variables\r\n|    |    |    |--variables.index\r\n|    |    |    |-- variables.data-00000-of-00001\r\n|\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/814111410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PhilippSchmaelzle","id":64705964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzA1OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64705964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippSchmaelzle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/814130257","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/474#issuecomment-814130257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/474","id":814130257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDEzMDI1Nw==","user":{"login":"Lostinecho","id":54021270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDIxMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54021270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho","html_url":"https://github.com/Lostinecho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-06T13:42:57Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T13:42:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@PhilippSchmaelzle Thanks for your help!

Hey, I use `1 / depth[:, :]` because I find that when the pixel is deeper the color predicted shows lighter, which is opposite to their performance, and also many people use this code for inference in this team's another code [depth_from_video_in_the_wild](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/depth_from_video_in_the_wild) which I think makes sense.\r\n\r\nI have just succeeded in reproduce depth map but the result of scene in wild is not so good. I think the reason is that I just train it in 5000 steps or I did not use Imagenet. But when I use it to train some simple images, it produces a nice result.\r\n\r\n**DATASET:** I create my dataset by download [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php) and then preprocess these images by [GenDataKITTI_gray](https://github.com/go125/depth_from_video_in_the_wild_eval_2020Winter/blob/main/GenDataKITTI_gray.py), which makes the images gray and put three frames together. \r\n\r\nBesides, you can refer to [depth_from_video_in_the_wild](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/depth_from_video_in_the_wild), which is similar to this program and they are made by a same team. Their method to get dataset is same. Also it has a example of training that really inspires me, so I think you can try it and make your dataset like [example](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/depth_from_video_in_the_wild/data_example). \r\n\r\nBy the way, maybe you'd better comment out the code about `mask` and `intrinsics` in `dataset/reader_cityscapes.py` if you just want to produce a depth map. \r\n\r\nI am not sure whether I have shared my experience clearly, so if you have any other questions, you can ask me. I'll be happy to reply to you.(^_^)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/824923556/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Lostinecho","id":54021270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDIxMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54021270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho","html_url":"https://github.com/Lostinecho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lostinecho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4631477957,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYzMTQ3Nzk1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4631477957","actor":{"login":"PhilippSchmaelzle","id":64705964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzA1OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64705964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippSchmaelzle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-22T15:05:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4631477964,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MzE0Nzc5NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4631477964","actor":{"login":"PhilippSchmaelzle","id":64705964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzA1OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64705964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippSchmaelzle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippSchmaelzle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-22T15:05:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"WeihengXia0123","id":54127937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTI3OTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54127937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeihengXia0123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeihengXia0123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-04T13:13:08Z","updated_at":"2021-05-04T13:13:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-rese

Hi, thank you for the information! I've tried to train and produce depth images several times but the predictions are not so good. I use Cityscapes as my dataset and train the model for about 10000 steps but I find the loss doesn't converge, swinging around 0.5, and there are severe artifacts in the depth images produced.  When I use a few hundreds of Cityscapes image sequences to do the training, it then performs much better. As you said, it works on simple datasets.\r\n\r\nAlthough you used KITTI as the dataset, I believe it should be similar to my Cityscapes case. May I ask whether you got a well-performed model trained on full KITTI images later? I will be super grateful if you can offer some details of your training model. It will be very helpful for me to figure out what the problem is here.

I initialized the mono_depth net with the [this resnet-18](https://github.com/dalgu90/resnet-18-tensorflow) which helped alot.\r\n\r\nFurther I trained on the named dataset for 100.000 steps (followd by some steps on my own data) which gave good results.\r\nThe artifacts you stated, I guess you mean some dotted or striped areas, will resolve themself after couple 10.000 steps.

Thank you so much for the information! I use the same dataset and same initialization, maybe I will just wait until it is trained for enough steps since the predictions look acceptable now. May I ask whether you use the given camera intrinsics, or just let the network learn it? I am also training another model using the given intrinsics but the model appears even worse.
