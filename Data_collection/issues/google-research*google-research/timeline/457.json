I was also wondering how to apply the pertained model in other scenarios. I could obtain the checkpoint files using the release training and the data pre-processing script, but since the project is highly integrated for better running performance, it's pretty hard to directly form an inference API. I tried something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef run(master, input_dataset_class, common_module, keypoint_profiles_module,\r\n        models_module, input_example_parser_creator, keypoint_preprocessor_3d,\r\n        create_model_input_fn, keypoint_distance_config_override,\r\n        embedder_fn_kwargs):\r\n\r\n  configs = _validate_and_setup(\r\n      common_module=common_module,\r\n      keypoint_profiles_module=keypoint_profiles_module,\r\n      models_module=models_module,\r\n      keypoint_distance_config_override=keypoint_distance_config_override,\r\n      embedder_fn_kwargs=embedder_fn_kwargs)\r\n\r\n  g = tf.Graph()\r\n  with g.as_default():\r\n    with tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(FLAGS.num_ps_tasks)):\r\n\r\n      with tf.Session() as sess:\r\n\r\n        embedder_fn = configs['embedder_fn']\r\n\r\n        loader = tf.train.import_meta_graph('checkpoints/model.ckpt-00001393' + '.meta')\r\n        loader.restore(sess, 'checkpoints/model.ckpt-00001393')\r\n\r\n        inputs = np.ones([512, 1, 26])\r\n        inputs = tf.cast(tf.convert_to_tensor(inputs), tf.float32)\r\n        outputs, activations = embedder_fn(inputs)\r\n        sess.run(tf.initializers.global_variables())\r\n        outputs_result, activations_result = sess.run([outputs, activations])\r\n        feature = outputs_result['unnormalized_embeddings']\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it seems the checkpoints are not successfully loaded since the feature changes with each run.\r\n\r\nWould you please provide some instructions on how we could tune-in the trained models for a test script?\r\nThank you very much for

What I did was modify train_base.py into an evaluation script. I first set `is_training` to be false in Line 401 in the configuration of embedder_fn, and then replace `def run()` with what I have pasted in the previous post. I tested the script with a pre-defined input which is an all-one tensor, which is supposed to give the same feature tensor every time I run the script. But it turns out that the values of the feature change, so I guess the pre-trained model parameters were not properly loaded.\r\n\r\nWould you indicate what I got wrong to implement such an inference API? All we need is to input some pre-processed 2D pose tensors and get the corresponding feature tensor. I suppose such an API is also needed for other people under this issue. Thank you for your consideration!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJingyuan\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/790242494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"snitchjinx","id":20622683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjIyNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20622683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx","html_url":"https://github.com/snitchjinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/790904737","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/457#issuecomment-790904737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/457","id":790904737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDkwNDczNw==","user":{"login":"jenjsun","id":40725770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzI1Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40725770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun","html_url":"https://github.com/jenjsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jenjsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T20:08:33Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T20:08:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello Jingyuan, co-author Ting Liu has added this inference script to the repo: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/poem/infer.py.

I got the pre-trained model from the website. I am now trying to match the results on 3DHP dataset. I have created the CSVs using the 11 cameras and the frames as mentioned in the repository. The pre-trained model gives 20 samples for each row. How do I calculate Hit@K value ? \r\nFrom what I understand, I first select a pair of camera. For the 3DHP dataset, for each camera view 6824 frames are listed, for all the 6824 frames I get the 20 samples using the infer.py script.  The script outputs the samples which have the shape - [6824, 320]. Now, I am considering the pair of cameras as C0 and C1, for both camera pairs I have the samples of size [6824, 320]. I am using sklearn's KNN classifier for calculating the distance between the two, but I have to change the metric because first [6824, 320] needs to be converted to [6824, 20, 16] and then the distance is calculated between all the 400 pair of samples and final result is averaged out. But isn't this computationally expensive because both the views have the shape 6824 which means that KNN has to compute the distances 6824 * 6824 times ? \r\nMy code is taking a lot of time for a single pair, how can I speed it up ?\r\n\r\n

Also, I just saw this blogpost https://towardsdatascience.com/make-knn-300-times-faster-than-scikit-learns-in-20-lines-5e29d74e76bb that says this KNN computation is faster compared to sklearn. However, I have not tried out Faiss before so cannot comment on whether that will be the case.
