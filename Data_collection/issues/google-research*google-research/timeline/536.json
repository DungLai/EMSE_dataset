Computation of `h`\r\n\r\n`h` is computed using Taylor expansion **to approximate the dot product formula described in the paper**.\r\n\r\nTo see why this is the case, please note that `cross_entropy['s_on_l_old']` is `S(x_l; \\theta_S^{(t-1)})` in the paper and `cross_entropy['s_on_l_new']` is `S(x_l; \\theta_S^{(t)})` in the paper. The difference between these two `theta`s is precisely `grad_S(x_u; \\theta_S^{(t-1)})` (or a centralized version derived from moving averages of past gradients).\r\n\r\nNow, the first-order Taylor approximation computes `f(x+h) - f(x) = h^T * grad_f(x)`. If you substitute all the components described above, you will see that the finite difference here approximates the dot product quantity in the paper.\r\n\r\n### Using _hard_ or _soft_ labels\r\n\r\nBoth work equally well. The only place where we actually need the soft labels is the large-scale ImageNet experiments with model parallelism and EfficientNet, but that's for a compiler reason. This repo provides the code for CIFAR-10-4000 and ImageNet-10%, for which both soft and hard labels will do well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/764804773/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hyhieu","id":5642307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDIzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu","html_url":"https://github.com/hyhieu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/765105271","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/536#issuecomment-765105271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/536","id":765105271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTEwNTI3MQ==","user":{"login":"humandream1","id":30650335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjUwMzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30650335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1","html_url":"https://github.com/humandream1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humandream1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-22T04:00:42Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T04:00:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your reply.

First of all, thank you for your work!\r\n\r\nI have a little question about the dot product approximation.\r\n\r\nI had read issues about the dot product approximation like [this](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/536) and [this](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/534).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn both explanations, to use Taylor approximation, student model accesses to the labeled images before and after the update.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the equation 12 in the paper, student model does not access labeled images before update.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the dot product-ing two vectors should be `s_loss_us_old` and `s_loss_l_new`, if I follow the variable names in your code.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how the code `dot_product = s_loss_l_new - s_loss_l_old` approximate the dot product.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you help me to figure out something that I am missing?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kekmodel/MPL-pytorch/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kekmodel/MPL-pytorch/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
