Sorry, I'm a very new to TF so not much aware. Could you please let me know how that can be done? You can have a look at my default command I used for training in my original post above. \r\n\r\n2) I added Tim's suggestions in ```train.py``` \r\n```\r\n...\r\nconfig = tf.estimator.RunConfig(FLAGS.model_dir, log_step_count_steps=1)\r\n...\r\ntf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.INFO)\r\n```\r\nThe simulation is still at the same point I mentioned. \r\n\r\n3) Launching ```tensorboard```, I can see the model graph, but I cannot see the training profile.
