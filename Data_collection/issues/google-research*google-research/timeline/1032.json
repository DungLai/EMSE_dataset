I see that you use OpenPose since the DGS corpus comes pre-processed with OpenPose landmarks. However, you use PoseNet for the demo, since that is significantly faster than OpenPose and can run in realtime.\r\nHowever, you only present results using OpenPose in the table. However, it is not very useful since it does not run in real time. Since the useful method is using PoseNet, could you share the accuracy results for the PoseNet version/demo version?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/1069065314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hshreeshail","id":28868617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODY4NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28868617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail","html_url":"https://github.com/hshreeshail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshreeshail/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
