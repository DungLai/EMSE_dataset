Do we have to sample two trajectories whose\n(s,s', a,r) are in order? What if we randomly select  (s,s', a,r) from two\ntasks? Like batch1 for task1 and batch2 for task2, then calculate the\ncontrastive loss based on batch1 and batch2.\n\nRishabh Agarwal ***@***.***> 于2022年8月10日周三 15:13写道：\n\n> The only thing we did in the original work was to find well performing\n> trajectories across 2 tasks from a single policy and assumed that some\n> states across these two tasks would be similar.
