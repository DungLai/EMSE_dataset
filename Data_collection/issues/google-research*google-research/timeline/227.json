You can find `mel_features.py` in `tensorflow_models/audioset/vggish/`. To fix this and oother import problems just create `tensorflow_models/audioset/__init__.py` and add the line: `from .vggish import mel_features, vggish_params, vggish_slim` Also, in file `tensorflow_models/audioset/vggish/vggish_slim.py` you should change the import to `from . import vggish_params as params`.\r\n> \r\n> You will also have problems with Tensorflow version: for me it worked r1.15 and changing in file `frechet_audio_distance/fad_utils.py` line 37 to `tf_record = tf.python_io.tf_record_iterator(filename).__next__()`\r\n\r\nAn update here on recent dig-in on FAD - TF 2.+ should work, I am using the more recent TF 2.11.0 but only changing line 37 as suggested by Javier, it works fine on my side.
