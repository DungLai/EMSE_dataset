Thank you so much for your response.\r\nDo you mean that a dense 3D network is normally a better choice if I can fit my model in memory? Although I only have 24x24x24 grid, I have 31 channels. I want a bigger cubic size if possible,  but I worried about the limitation of memory. Maybe I can fit the model in memory, but I have to use a small batch size to train my model. I am dealing with chemical molecules, so most of the values on the grid are zero. So, I am interested in your work.\r\n\r\nI found your work from the blog \"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/02/introduction-to-tensorflow-3d-for-3d-scene-understanding-by-google-ai/\". It mentioned the paper \"Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks\". I mistakenly think that is your paper. Sorry about that.
