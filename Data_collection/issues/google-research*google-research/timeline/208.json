have been using something equivalent to equation (4) from this paper to find the scale factor for a particular frame: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07714.pdf. This method uses a scale factor equal to the ratio of median depths between ground truth and prediction. I believe this is a common way to compute the scale factor. The method outlined in the paper I referenced looks interesting, I would be very interested if anyone has tried this and/or found a better
