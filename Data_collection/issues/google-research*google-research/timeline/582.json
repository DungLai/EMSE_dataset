some out-of-band discussions with @maniatis confirmed that the finetuning code had to be intentionally omitted due to ties with internal Google source.\r\n\r\nHowever, Petros was thankfully able to confirm some details like that long functions were handled with truncating from the beginning and that eval was done equivalently.\r\n\r\nThat was enough to replicate finetuning of at least one task I tried. I found the easiest way to do this was using [Huggingface Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). First I ran [conversion scripts](https://huggingface.co/transformers/converting_tensorflow_models.html#bert) and then was able to use this as input to `BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained()` and finetune with the huggingface [Train](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html#trainer) functionality. In [this gist](https://gist.github.com/DNGros/7c2fa0dcf566bd9f3732618669b591dd) I put the bert config used to convert, and the Huggingface API-complient tokenizer I used.\r\n\r\nI'm currently in the middle of a messy research code version of playing with all the tasks, so not in a place to share whole pipelines. However, if you're seeing this in the future and run in to difficulties getting it working in your workflow, feel free to @ mention me here and I can give an update on if I had shared any more code for the tasks at that time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/794260254/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DNGros","id":5520022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5520022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros","html_url":"https://github.com/DNGros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4430387164,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQzMDM4NzE2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4430387164","actor":{"login":"DNGros","id":5520022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5520022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros","html_url":"https://github.com/DNGros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-09T18:17:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4430387195,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQzMDM4NzE5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4430387195","actor":{"login":"maniatis","id":25111449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTExNDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25111449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis","html_url":"https://github.com/maniatis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-09T18:17:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4430387200,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MzAzODcyMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4430387200","actor":{"login":"maniatis","id":25111449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTExNDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25111449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis","html_url":"https://github.com/maniatis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maniatis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-09T18:17:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"DNGros","id":5520022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5520022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros","html_url":"https://github.com/DNGro
