Although models built with tf recommenders load fine in Triton, they throw an exception at serving time as the ScaNN operation (used for nearest neighbor search) does not seem to be supported by the tensorflow backend in triton. It is important to have this support because tf recommenders is state-of-the-art for recommender systems and has wide adoption in the industry.

Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process. Note that if you are loading a saved graph which used ops from tf.contrib, accessing (e.g.) `tf.contrib.resampler` should be done before importing the graph, as contrib ops are lazily registered when the module is first accessed.\r\n\t [[{{node StatefulPartitionedCall}}]]\r\n\t [[StatefulPartitionedCall]]\r\n```\r\n**Triton Information**\r\nWhat version of Triton are you using?\r\n21.06\r\nAre you using the Triton container or did you build it yourself?\r\nUsing the container\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nload any tf recs model and make inference using the ScaNN operation.\r\nHere is more information about the ScaNN [layer](https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders/api_docs/python/tfrs/layers/factorized_top_k/ScaNN)\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nScaNN operations should be supported out of the box by triton's tensorflow backend.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/triton-inference-server/server/issues/3664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/triton-inference-server/server/issues/3664/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
