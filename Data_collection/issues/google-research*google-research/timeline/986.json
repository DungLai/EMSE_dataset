So you can ignore (1).\r\n\r\nFor 2, 3, unfortunately the jobs might have been accidentally killed before they could finish pretraining and was only finished up till 300k steps. At a later time, we could retrain them. For now, it would be awesome if there is a way to mark them as 300k (or something similar). \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!

- we've finalized the port of all model checkpoints except **SH** and **SKV**. We've also converted each checkpoint to PyTorch and JAX/Flax besides TF and added a model card. You can see all checkpoints here: \r\nhttps://huggingface.co/models?other=deep-narrow (We'll probably move the checkpoints soon to the google organization).\r\n\r\nDoes that sound good to you? Do the model cards look good to you? \r\n\r\nAlso, do you have a table where one could retrieve the downstream performance of a specific checkpoint and the computational complexity by any chance? The graphs in the paper are super nice, but it's difficult to retrieve the exact numbers of a checkpoint.
