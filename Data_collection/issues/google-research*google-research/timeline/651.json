there,\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed reading the paper by @hyhieu et al.! I don't have the resources to train the models, or even run the code, but I do have some questions about the code. Especially about the loss of the teacher model. If I'm understanding correctly, the final loss is defined here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/ec13eb6661a7b9500016cc6d7e3ab940c2dbf184/meta_pseudo_labels/training_utils.py#L494-L496\r\n\r\nI have a question about the MPL term. `cross_entropy['mpl'] * dot_product`.\r\n\r\n`dot_product` seems to be a scalar (like mentioned in the paper), without gradient computation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/ec13eb6661a7b9500016cc6d7e3ab940c2dbf184/meta_pseudo_labels/training_utils.py#L483\r\n\r\n`cross_entropy['mpl']` seems to be defined a few lines above:\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/ec13eb6661a7b9500016cc6d7e3ab940c2dbf184/meta_pseudo_labels/training_utils.py#L484-L487\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a cross-entropy where the logits and targets are the same (since `softmax_cross_entropy` also applies a softmax to the logits). This loss can be non-zero when the targets are not 'hard' (soft targets), however, I don't think there is any signal in that case? Since the logits and targets seem to be equal. \r\n\r\nMy question is — if I'm understanding the code correctly — if there is no signal and it's scaled by the `dot_product`, I do not know what the value is of this term in the optimization?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your work!\r\nHans\r\n\r\nP.S. small side question: in the paper, it is mentioned the method uses hard-targets, but I cannot find this in the code.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/534/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
