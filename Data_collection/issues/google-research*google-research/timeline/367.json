With this set up loss function computation may be more numerically stable as mentioned in [SparseCategoricalCrossentropy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/SparseCategoricalCrossentropy)\r\n\r\nreturn_softmax was introduced for special cases where loss function require probability distribution. For example if you change parameters of your loss function SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False) and set from_logits=False then you will need to enable return_softmax=1.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to modify return_softmax in this lib. If you plan to modify your loss function, only then you should consider to use return_softmax (depending on loss function parameters/config).\r\nPlease let me know if you have more
