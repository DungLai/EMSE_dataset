This work was never intended to predict 3D key points.  Instead, it only aims to embed the poses such that similar 3D poses would produce similar embeddings.  This is meant for applications like action recognition, pose retrieval and syncing of videos.  So there is no capability to decode these embeddings into 3D key points, but this shouldn't be hard to extend from the author's work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/1289959878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"buckeye17","id":17264335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjY0MzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17264335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17","html_url":"https://github.com/buckeye17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7659739217,"node_id":"CE_lADOCQmIhc5UltHgzwAAAAHIjlhR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/7659739217","actor":{"login":"buckeye17","id":17264335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjY0MzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17264335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17","html_url":"https://github.com/buckeye17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buckeye17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-25T04:26:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
