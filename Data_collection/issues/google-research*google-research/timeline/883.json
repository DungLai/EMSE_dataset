The data reader with data splitting logic was taken from the original [speech commands paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209) for compatibility with previously published results. \r\n\r\nGiven that you are customizing your own data, I would suggest using [approach with training/testing on customized data](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/kws_streaming#training-on-custom-data), discussed in [thread](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/809). This way you have direct control over training and testing data sets - it will simplify your experiments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/967299892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5611145610,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQmIhc4-nuy_zwAAAAFOc0mK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5611145610","actor":{"login":"vishalkevat007","id":29162378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTYyMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29162378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007","html_url":"https://github.com/vishalkevat007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-12T17:45:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5611145615,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQmIhc4-nuy_zwAAAAFOc0mP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5611145615","actor":{"login":"vishalkevat007","id":29162378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTYyMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29162378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007","html_url":"https://github.com/vishalkevat007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-12T17:45:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5803071206,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQmIhc4-nuy_zwAAAAFZ49bm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5803071206","actor":{"login":"Aniket7013","id":91822722,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXkagg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91822722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013","html_url":"https://github.com/Aniket7013","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aniket7013/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-22T07:29:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
