\"--preprocess \"mfcc\"\" option uses [custom audio ops](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/layers/speech_features.py#L225) which is non streamable, so if you need to use it then you have to decopule you model from preprocessor, so that you will manage preprocessing on your own and stream the rest of the model which will take mfcc features as input (you will need to modify the model inputs).
