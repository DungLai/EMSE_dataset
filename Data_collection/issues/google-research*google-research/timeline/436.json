So you are right that for unbiased sampling from the Haar measure, flipping of the columns via R should be done, however here ultimately we want unbiased low-variance estimation of the kernel value, not of the matrix. If flipping is not done, the marginal distributions  of rows (after chi(d)-renormalization) are still Gaussian so kernel estimator remains unbiased. Furthermore, since all the proofs effectively rely only on the fact that marginal distributions of rows match gaussian and different rows are exactly orthogonal, all the results regarding lower variance for the orthogonal case remain valid regardless of whether you use R or not. So ultimately whether you use R or not should not matter when we talk about the accuracy of kernel estimation.

This is what is done in many papers on ORFs (for reference: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6246-orthogonal-random-features). Lets conclude this thread with the statement that if you want to have exact Haar measure, you should definitely flip according to R and it is definitely not a bad idea (thank you for catching this !). And of course in theoretical results Haar measure is assumed. I would encourage you to run Performers with R-based flipping and without on a couple of downstream tasks and if you see additional gains in *nontrivial downstream tasks* from flipping, please let us know right away

for the response. \r\n\r\nI agree with you that in higher dimensions this probably doesnt affect the MSE as much.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've observed it does increase variance in all cases, but that
