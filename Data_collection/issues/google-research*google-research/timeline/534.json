Please find the answers to your\nquestions inline below, and please let me know if you have any further\nquestions.\n\n*--Hieu*\n\n\nOn Wed, Jan 20, 2021 at 12:00 AM Hans Pinckaers <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi there,\n>\n> I really enjoyed reading the paper by @hyhieu <https://github.com/hyhieu>\n> et al.! I don't have the resources to train the models, or even run the\n> code, but I do have some questions about the code. Especially about the\n> loss of the teacher model. If I'm understanding correctly, the final loss\n> is defined here:\n>\n>\n> https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/ec13eb6661a7b9500016cc6d7e3ab940c2dbf184/meta_pseudo_labels/training_utils.py#L494-L496\n>\n> I have a question about the MPL term. cross_entropy['mpl'] * dot_product.\n>\n> dot_product seems to be a scalar (like mentioned in the paper), without\n> gradient computation:\n>\n>\n> https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/ec13eb6661a7b9500016cc6d7e3ab940c2dbf184/meta_pseudo_labels/training_utils.py#L483\n>\nYes. dot_product is intended to be cross_entropy['s_on_l_new'] -\ncross_entropy['s_on_l_old']. I use the Taylor approximation that for any\nfunction f and a small perturbation vector h, we have: f(x+h) - f(x) = h^T\n* grad_f(x).\nNote that the difference between the weights in the student models\nat 's_on_l_new' and 's_on_l_old' is the gradient computed on the data that\nthe teacher provides, so the resulting difference approximates the dot\nproduct of that gradient and student_grad['s_on_l_old']. For better\nunderstanding, I suggest that you refer to the pseudo code and the\nderivation in the Appendix of our paper and figure out the reference which\nterms correspond to what parts in the code.\n\n> cross_entropy['mpl'] seems to be defined a few lines above:\n>\n> https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/ec13eb6661a7b9500016cc6d7e3ab940c2dbf184/meta_pseudo_labels/training_utils.py#L484-L487\n>\n> This seems to be a cross-entropy where the logits and targets are the same\n> (since softmax_cross_entropy also applies a softmax to the logits). This\n> loss can be non-zero when the targets are not 'hard' (soft targets),\n> however, I don't think there is any signal in that case? Since the logits\n> and targets seem to be equal.\n>\nThe targets are not equal to the logits. The targets are the softmax of the\nlogits, but its gradients must be stopped (as done in the code). This loss\nwill always be positive. It could be scaled into a negative number by the\ndot_product, but the cross_entropy loss by itself is always positive.\n\nTo understand why the cross_entropy is computed like that, you would need\nto refer to our Appendix in the paper. It's a variation of the log-gradient\ntrick in the REINFORCE algorithm in reinforcement learning. Both soft\ntargets and hard targets conform to this derivation. In the paper, we\nintended to say that \"we *support sampling hard labels*\". In detailed\nimplementations, we do this for the large-scale tasks on ImageNet+extra\ndata but we use soft labels for CIFAR-10-4000 and ImageNet-10% as it's\nfaster. Both works, but for some reasons that I don't know, sampling hard\nlabels work better for large-scale ImageNet models.\n\n> My question is — if I'm understanding the code correctly — if there is no\n> signal and it's scaled by the dot_product, I do not know what the value\n> is of this term in the optimization?\n>\nMaybe this question is related to the one above? As I mentioned, the signal\nwill always be positive, but could be scaled negatively by dot_product.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/763805052/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hyhieu","id":5642307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDIzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu","html_url":"https://github.com/hyhieu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4229065623,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIyOTA2NTYyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4229065623","actor":{"login":"hyhieu","id":5642307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDIzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu","html_url":"https://github.com/hyhieu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-20T17:21:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4229065626,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMjkwNjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4229065626","actor":{"login":"hyhieu","id":5642307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDIzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu","html_url":"https://github.com/hyhieu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyhieu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-20T17:21:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"kekmodel","id":7728527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mjg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7728527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel","html_url":"https://github.com/kekmodel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kekmodel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-25T11:55:39Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T11:55:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/541","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/541/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/541/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/541/event

@kekmodel, the root of my question was indeed about the same thing. It is essentially (in pseudocode) a `cross_entropy(preds=softmax(logits), targets=softmax(logits))` as such minimizing this would not make a lot of sense I think. Also, I think you are correct, even if you want to maximize it (when `dot_product` is negative) the computation of the gradients seem still to result in zeroes. However, I didn't have time to investigate the REINFORCE method mentioned by
