Having the distortion predicted by the network. In this case, we only predicted quadratic distortion and ignored quartic distortion. You have to make sure that the distortion curve is monotonically increasing, and if we let the network predict arbitrary distortions, that won't be the case and the training will crash. We way we did it is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n      maxx = tf.maximum(intrinsic_mat[:, 0, 2], tf.to_float(image_width) - intrinsic_mat[:, 0, 2])\r\n      maxy = tf.maximum(intrinsic_mat[:, 1, 2], tf.to_float(image_height) - intrinsic_mat[:, 1, 2])\r\n      maxx /= intrinsic_mat[:, 0, 0]\r\n      maxy /= intrinsic_mat[:, 1, 1]\r\n      maxrr = maxx * maxx + maxy * maxy\r\n      min_distortion = -4.0 / 27.0/ maxrr\r\n\r\n      min_distortion = tf.expand_dims(min_distortion, -1)\r\n      min_distortion = tf.expand_dims(min_distortion, -1)\r\n\r\n      distortion_coeff = min_distortion + tf.squeeze(layers.conv2d(\r\n          bottleneck,\r\n          1, [1, 1],\r\n          stride=1,\r\n          activation_fn=tf.nn.softplus,\r\n          weights_regularizer=None,\r\n          scope='distortion'), axis=(3))\r\n```\r\nNow the distortion curve is monotonically increasing through the entire image.\r\n\r\n2. You can have the intrinsics, including distortion, predicted directly by variables rather than by a network, if we know that the entire dataset was captured with the same camera (such as in EuRoC). Then you just initialize the distortions to zero, and they converge to the right values over time\r\n\r\nHope that helps...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/668810493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gariel-google","id":15641140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQxMTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15641140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google","html_url":"https://github.com/gariel-google","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gariel-google/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3621916359,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYyMTkxNjM1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/3621916359","actor":{"login":"adizhol","id":13086455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDg2NDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13086455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol","html_url":"https://github.com/adizhol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-04T20:31:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3621916361,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MjE5MTYzNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/3621916361","actor":{"login":"adizhol","id":13086455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDg2NDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13086455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol","html_url":"https://github.com/adizhol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-04T20:31:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/669132290","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/340#issuecomment-669132290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/340","id":669132290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTEzMjI5MA==","user":{"login":"adizhol","id":13086455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDg2NDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13086455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol","html_url":"https://github.com/adizhol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adizhol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-05T11:10:31Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T11:10:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,
