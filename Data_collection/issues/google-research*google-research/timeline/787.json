The phenomena is quite strange: the estimate\n> average step reward is quite close to the behavior policy's step reward\n> rather than the target policy's. Since there is no source code for\n> continuous action setting, could you help to provide more details?\n> i) when calculating \\nu(s',a'), I use (1/N)*\\sum_{i=1}^{N}nu(s',\\pi(s'))\n> and try N=1,10,100 respectively, and the results are the same. How you\n> calculate it?\n> ii) For this setting, do you choose Fenchel conjugate trick or not?\n> iii) Is any other tips I need to know?\n>\n> Look forward to your reply.\n> Best wishes.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/787>, or\n> unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AVH3EEXPLKZBT3LLSI4DYBDT5S55FANCNFSM5CNWM6GQ>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/901724966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ramon199810","id":89109010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTA5MDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89109010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810","html_url":"https://github.com/ramon199810","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramon199810/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5179363333,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE3OTM2MzMzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5179363333","actor":{"login":"eladeban","id":40275510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjc1NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40275510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban","html_url":"https://github.com/eladeban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-19T09:02:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5179363340,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNzkzNjMzNDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5179363340","actor":{"login":"eladeban","id":40275510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjc1NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40275510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban","html_url":"https://github.com/eladeban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladeban/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-19T09:02:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
