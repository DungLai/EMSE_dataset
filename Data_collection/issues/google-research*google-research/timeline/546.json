But I checked that use_noise_shaped_trainig's default value is false (refering ./scann/proto/hash.proto) and its value does not change. In summary, above if clause is never true, so it never enters to function ComputeParallelCostMultiplier. So whatever value I give to `anisotropic_quantization_threshold`, parallel_cost_multiplier value is always 1. \r\nRefering to paper, it this value is 1 _\" the update rule becomes finding the average of datapoints in the partition, same as standard k-means update rule.\"_ It is not ScaNN, it's just k-means clustering. Could you tell me where ScaNN uses the loss function from the paper?\r\n2) Assuming 1) problem is resolved, it still calls \r\n`ComputeParallelCostMultiplier(opts.config().noise_shaping_threshold(), 1.0, dataset.dimensionality())` at hashes/internal/asymmetric_hashing_impl.cc:191. Refering to the paper, 1.0 should be the norm of the database. It will specially work with glove since we normalized its norms, but for general MIPS problems, norms of the database are not constant. How should we fix it to support dataset with various norms?   \r\n3) How do we set use_noise_shaped_training to True? I can just fix ./scann/proto/hash.proto, but is there any way to set this value via paremter?\r\n\r\nI will be very helpful if you answer above questions!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/775941027/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YJYJLee","id":28900943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTAwOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28900943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee","html_url":"https://github.com/YJYJLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YJYJLee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4309206720,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDMwOTIwNjcyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4309206720","actor":{"login":"sammymax","id":6895661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTU2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6895661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax","html_url":"https://github.com/sammymax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-09T13:37:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4309206725,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzMDkyMDY3MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4309206725","actor":{"login":"sammymax","id":6895661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTU2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6895661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax","html_url":"https://github.com/sammymax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammymax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-09T13:37:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/797772700","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/546#issuecomment-797772700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/546","id":797772700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5Nzc3MjcwMA==","user":{"login":"vsippola","id":10835410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODM1NDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10835410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola","html_url":"https://github.com/vsippola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsippola/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-12T21:43:33Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T21:43:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For
