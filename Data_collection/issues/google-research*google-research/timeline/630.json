compilation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/801483841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HRLTY","id":7825697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MjU2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7825697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY","html_url":"https://github.com/HRLTY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4472873609,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ3Mjg3MzYwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4472873609","actor":{"login":"FrancescoMandru","id":43784964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzg0OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43784964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru","html_url":"https://github.com/FrancescoMandru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T22:29:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4472873617,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NzI4NzM2MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4472873617","actor":{"login":"FrancescoMandru","id":43784964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzg0OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43784964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru","html_url":"https://github.com/FrancescoMandru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T22:29:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/801489777","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/630#issuecomment-801489777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/630","id":801489777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTQ4OTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"FrancescoMandru","id":43784964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzg0OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43784964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru","html_url":"https://github.com/FrancescoMandru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancescoMandru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github

for trying it. This is a typical python import error.\n\nI am not exactly sure your folder layout. But make sure you are in the *parent* folder of tf3d if you want to run \"import tf3d.ops.tensorflow_sparse_conv_ops as sparse_conv_ops”. Besides, each subfolder(if I am correct) should have a `__init__.py` file there, empty or not. \nPlease check some tutorials for placing it correctly.\n\nThanks!\n\nSincerely,\nRui\n\n\n> On Mar 18, 2021, at 10:42 AM, FraMan ***@***.***> wrote:\n> \n> \n> Hi @HRLTY <https://github.com/HRLTY>, this morning I fixed everything doing again from scratch.
