I encountered this problem and  failed to solve it after searching for several solutions to similar(just look like similar) issues.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned in #962, I modified the `objectives.py` for conducting a multi-gpu pre-training experiment and encountered this problem. Then I tried to inplement a single-gpu version and also encountered this problem.\r\n\r\nThe error information is as:\r\n```\r\n2022-02-11 15:07:20.266179: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1745] OP_REQUIRES failed at strided_slice_op.cc:108 : INVALID_ARGUMENT: slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds.\r\n2022-02-11 15:07:20.266326: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1745] OP_REQUIRES failed at strided_slice_op.cc:108 : INVALID_ARGUMENT: slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds.\r\n2022-02-11 15:07:20.266722: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1745] OP_REQUIRES failed at strided_slice_op.cc:108 : INVALID_ARGUMENT: slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds.\r\n2022-02-11 15:07:20.268130: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1745] OP_REQUIRES failed at strided_slice_op.cc:108 : INVALID_ARGUMENT: slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds.\r\n2022-02-11 15:07:20.268490: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1745] OP_REQUIRES failed at strided_slice_op.cc:108 : INVALID_ARGUMENT: slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"main.py\", line 97, in <module>\r\n    app.run(main)\r\n  File \"anaconda3/envs/vatt/lib/python3.9/site-packages/absl/app.py\", line 303, in run\r\n    _run_main(main, args)\r\n  File \"anaconda3/envs/vatt/lib/python3.9/site-packages/absl/app.py\", line 251, in _run_main\r\n    sys.exit(main(argv))\r\n  File \"main.py\", line 93, in main\r\n    return executor.run(mode=params.mode)\r\n  File \"experiments/base.py\", line 439, in run\r\n    self.train()\r\n  File \"experiments/base.py\", line 280, in train\r\n    metrics = train_step(data_iterator, num_iterations)\r\n  File \"anaconda3/envs/vatt/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/traceback_utils.py\", line 153, in error_handler\r\n    raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None\r\n  File \"anaconda3/envs/vatt/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/eager/execute.py\", line 58, in quick_execute\r\n    tensors = pywrap_tfe.TFE_Py_Execute(ctx._handle, device_name, op_name,\r\ntensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: 2 root error(s) found.\r\n  (0) INVALID_ARGUMENT:  slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds.\r\n         [[{{node strided_slice_3}}]]\r\n         [[while/body/_1/while/IteratorGetNext]]\r\n         [[while/body/_1/while/model/tx_mlp_fac/backbone_stack/audio_module/wat_base/RandomShuffle/_72]]\r\n  (1) INVALID_ARGUMENT:  slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds.\r\n         [[{{node strided_slice_3}}]]\r\n         [[while/body/_1/while/IteratorGetNext]]\r\n0 successful operations.\r\n0 derived errors ignored.

Since I'm not familiar with Tensorflow framework, the code base_and_objectives.tar.gz may exists a lot of  ridiculous problems. Do you have some idea about this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/997/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
