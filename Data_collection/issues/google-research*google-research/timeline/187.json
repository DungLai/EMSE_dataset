am hopeful that it is released as open source, for the benefit of the world.   I would implement it.  I would use it within my conversational chatbot, ElfChat [iOS and android].\r\n\r\nIt is likely I would have to implement a control script to choose the best response.  Some of the responses would be this engine, some would be responses that are more focused on the long term conversation, what has been learned about the individual talking, the mood, other factors and the incoming intent.    If a conversational avatar relies on strictly machine learning for a response, the choice will be based on the training data, which will be accurate, but not specific to the individual.  It will be the most likely response given the training. \r\n\r\nIn a long term conversation,  this falls apart.  There has to be context within the reply, and this can be generated by manually created models.  \r\nI propose that a good model is a mix where the avatar has a choice of responding with a machine learned response or a response that is more predetermined based on personal conversation factors.  \r\nIn reality, humans talk this way.  They respond based on what they know or they respond based on a pattern or flow that is sensible to the long term conversation.   \r\n\r\nThere are many use cases where one type of response [ML or predetermined] is preferable.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/589661367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"appl044","id":43420252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDIwMjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43420252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044","html_url":"https://github.com/appl044","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/appl044/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/596277781","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/187#issuecomment-596277781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/187","id":596277781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjI3Nzc4MQ==","user":{"login":"KoolenDasheppi","id":13336171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzM2MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13336171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi","html_url":"https://github.com/KoolenDasheppi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoolenDasheppi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T01:10:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T01:10:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I hope this doesn't turn into the OpenAI GPT-2 ordeal.
