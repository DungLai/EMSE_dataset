the [first thread](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/48070) in tensorflow/tensorflow.\r\n\r\n**Describe the feature and the current behavior/state.**\r\n\r\nTensorFlow already incorporates a native Non Max Suppression algorithm for 2D bounding boxes. It is used for instance for objet detection tasks, usually after a anchor box generation step as it is observed in YOLO. Another remarkable use exists within the Mask R-CNN algorithm: many anchor boxes are generated (~200,000-300,000 boxes). After a step to reduce this number to 6,000 using some classification results, tf.image.non_max_suppression is called to sort these 6,0000 best anchors and finally obtain 2,000 regions of interest.\r\n\r\nThe feature would consist of a Non Max Suppression algorithm for three dimensional bounding boxes. This 3D Non Max Suppression would almost have the same parameters than the existing 2D implementation, called with\r\n\r\n```\r\ntf.image.non_max_suppression(\r\n    boxes, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold=0.5,\r\n    score_threshold=float('-inf'), name=None\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `boxes` containing no more the 4 coordinates of the two points that define a 2D bounding box, but the 6 coordinates of the two points defining a 3D bounding box. The other parameters would stay the same. The heart of this addition would be to adapt the IOU (Intersection Over Union) function within the Non Max Suppression C file to a three dimensional IOU evaluation.\r\n\r\n**Relevant information**\r\n- Are you willing to contribute it (yes/no): Yes although I've almost no experience in C++\r\n*If you wish to contribute, then read the requirements for new contributions in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#requirements-for-new-contributions-to-the-repository)*\r\n- Are you willing to maintain it going forward? (yes/no): Yes but it will not be necessary\r\n- Is there a relevant academic paper? (if so, where): No\r\n- Does the relavent academic paper exceed 50 citations? (yes/no): No\r\n- Is there already an implementation in another framework? (if so, where): Some tried to implement it in PyTorch (see benefice part)\r\n- Was it part of tf.contrib? (if so, where): No\r\n\r\n**Which API type would this fall under (layer, metric, optimizer, etc.)**\r\n\r\nIt falls under the image processing API part (tf.image). The feature would add a Non Max Suppression algorithm _tf.image.non_max_suppression_3d_ to TensorFlow for 3D bounding boxes following the structure of the existing 2D implementation. It will add three files to _tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/_ : _non_max_suppression_3d_op.cc_, _non_max_suppression_3d_op.cu.cc_ and _non_max_suppression_3d_op.h_.\r\n\r\n**Who will benefit with this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis addon will greatly benefit to the increasing community of 3D object detection or 3D instance segmentation. The demand is increasing. I give two examples: this stackoverflow thread (alas removed by its author now), and this implementation in PyTorch that possesses a not working 3D implementation of the NMS (the implementation author have been asked many times to correct it). It actually exists some implementations in Python language but the speed performance given by a C implementation would be crucial when handling 3D data.\r\n\r\n**Any other info.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/addons/issues/2434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/addons/issues/2434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/1114303123","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/660#issuecomment-1114303123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/660","id":1114303123,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQmIhc5CauqT","user":{"login":"cristinaperez9","id":58118140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTE4MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58118140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9","html_url":"https://github.com/cristinaperez9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristinaperez9/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-01T18:21:05Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T18:21:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I've implemented a 3D version of the non max suppression algorithm in C following the tensorflow tutorial to create custom operation.
