Generally, it should be able to manually compile in most environments. However, due to TF compiling environment differences, some symbols exist in other tf `so` libraries outisde of `libtensorflow_framework.so.2`. The general solution is to find that symbol's containing `so` file (check other tutorials for this), link it during the compilation too (i.e. _ZN10tensorflow4tf3d18ValidateConvInputsEbiPNS_15OpKernelContextE), and make sure run time can access the `so` library too.\r\n\r\nTo keep things standard, we are only testing the docker environment used for compiling pip TensorFlow versions(from https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op). TF 2.4's support, based on our initial exploration, is also a similar `symbol not found` problem. We plan to look into that

It's interesting that a function *within* the package is not included in the compiled `so` library. I would guess the problem is more related to the differences between your Linux compiling environment v.s. the docker image from `custom-op` repo than Tensorflow version. There might also be a problem loading the compiled `so` in your environment somehow.\r\nI suggest looking at Bazel's *log* for the actual gcc/clang command line and compare it with that from compiling inside the docker. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, given the various dependencies on other packages and TensorFlow's Bazel build files and the Bazel helper functions in this package, it won't be easy to translate to makefile/CmakeList manually. With that said, we certainly welcome any contribution. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/792505570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HRLTY","id":7825697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MjU2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7825697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY","html_url":"https://github.com/HRLTY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HRLTY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4419457405,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQxOTQ1NzQwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4419457405","actor":{"login":"soldierofhell","id":45559276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTU5Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45559276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell","html_url":"https://github.com/soldierofhell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-08T06:30:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4419457408,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MTk0NTc0MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/4419457408","actor":{"login":"soldierofhell","id":45559276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTU5Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45559276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell","html_url":"https://github.com/soldierofhell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soldierofhell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-08T06:30:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
