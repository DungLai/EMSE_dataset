You could restore model weights by inserting model.load_weights() in this [line](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/kws_streaming/train/train.py#L121). There is one problem with such approach: it does not restore optimizer state, because we did not checkpointing it. Overall I would suggest just to re-train the model (data and models are small). We assume that data and training are owned by user and our focus was mostly on streaming aware models/layers design, so training script here is for a demo purpose.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/906942970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/907286827","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/790#issuecomment-907286827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/790","id":907286827,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQmIhc42FBkr","user":{"login":"vishalkevat007","id":29162378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTYyMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29162378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007","html_url":"https://github.com/vishalkevat007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vishalkevat007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T15:29:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T15:29:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thankyou
