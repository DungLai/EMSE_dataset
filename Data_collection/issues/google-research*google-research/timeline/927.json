In non custom split \"silence\" and \"unknown\" labels are added under the hood (for compatibility with previously published papers) and it can confuse some users. That is why we introduced custom split, where data split is defined explicitly by user (in this case this lib does not do anything under the hood): it removes any confusions and we would prefer to keep this distinction between custom and non custom splits as it is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/1006284992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rybakov","id":6813603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov","html_url":"https://github.com/rybakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rybakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5850211882,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQmIhc5BA-6RzwAAAAFcsyYq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5850211882","actor":{"login":"bdytx5","id":32812705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODEyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32812705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5","html_url":"https://github.com/bdytx5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-06T04:56:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5850211885,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQmIhc5BA-6RzwAAAAFcsyYt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/events/5850211885","actor":{"login":"bdytx5","id":32812705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODEyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32812705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5","html_url":"https://github.com/bdytx5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-06T04:56:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/comments/1010584538","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/927#issuecomment-1010584538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/927","id":1010584538,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQmIhc48PEva","user":{"login":"bdytx5","id":32812705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODEyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32812705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5","html_url":"https://github.com/bdytx5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdytx5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T03:04:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T03:04:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
