However, with your default setting (batch size=4, learning_rate=0.0002, etc.) training from scratch, the result I got it's quite far from what you stated in the paper (Abs Rel 0.147 for the best checkpoint within around 370k-th step vs 0.128 in the paper). For your information, I am using the evaluation code from [sfmlearner](https://github.com/tinghuiz/SfMLearner/tree/master/kitti_eval) as what struct2depth does.  \r\nTherefore, may I know what's setting for obtaining the paper's result? Or is there anything critical part missing in the current released code (maybe pretrained checkpoint for example)?   \r\nThank you in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"liyingliu","id":18667188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18667188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu","html_url":"https://github.com/liyingliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyingliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
