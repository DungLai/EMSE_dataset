I notice \"classifier_activation\" is set to false in model config, which means the output logit of NSP won't be normalized using \"tanh\" and value will be quite large, like [3e6, 3e6]. Since I think MLM logit is normalized through the final layer normalization layer and won't be very large, is it correct to combine the small MLM loss with a huge NSP loss? or I miss some processing steps in the code?\r\nHope you can explain that for me, and please tell me the final loss of MLM and NSP.
