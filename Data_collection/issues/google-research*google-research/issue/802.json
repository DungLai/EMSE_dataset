Really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nThis isn't an issue but it is a request to share any guide or links using which I can implement the trained models to spot the keywords on my computer locally using the mic. I could not find any guide in the repo that can help us test the models in the live audio feed from computers or phones. I would really appreciate any heads up in that direction!","closed_by":{"login":"srewai","id":32038717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDM4NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32038717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai","html_url":"https://github.com/srewai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srewai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
