The way of making data mentioned in the paper is very good, but I wonder if there is more theoretical explanation for this way?  This paper is only mentioned in Chapter 4: 'The additive nature of light implies we can model flare\r\nas an additive artifact on top of the “ideal” image' . After subtracting F from the If I shot, there will be a purple artifact around the light source.  I am very confused. Could you please tell me the reason why you made the data like this?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
