First of all, thanks for the great work and sharing the code. I have a couple of questions regarding the batch size used in the paper.\r\n\r\n1. The paper mentions (Section 3.3 Implementation Details) about using a batch size of 4096 images for labelled data and 32768 for unlabelled data in a single iteration step. I was thinking about the impact if the Student is updated using pseudo labels on unlabelled data with a batch size of 4096 and repeat the process 8 times (effective batch size of 32768) and then update the Teacher with the feedback of Student's performance on 4096 labelled images. Could you please share your thoughts on this, or if you tried any experiments with this strategy?\r\n2. How would the method perform if trained with a smaller batch size, e.g. 256, 512 etc? Would its performance be close to the paper results or drop down significantly?\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if you could provide some insights into the above queries on batch size or if you have some results with these that you could please share.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nThank You !!\r\n\r\nAnuj","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/937/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
