When the tensor is flattened it will have shape (batch_size, n_timestaps, 59200), and GRN layer has to process about 30 million of trainable parameters (59200 * 160 * 4). If we add sizes of GRN layers from each individual feature (160 * 160 * 4), the total number of parameters will be close to 70 million, which seems quite big in comparison with LSTM and MultiHeadAttention sizes (200k and 100k respectively).\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/788/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
