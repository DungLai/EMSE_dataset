For example, my ideal tutorial for semantic segmentation would be.\r\n\r\n1 - How to prepare you dataset for the network. Which data are needed? In which format? etc..\r\n2 - Build a simple model from scratch using sparse convolutions etc, or loading existing ones, how to feed data inside the model and how tu run a training. \r\n3 - Load trained weights and test the result\r\n\r\nI know that these information can be extracted from the repository but I think that some examples with detailed documentation will be very useful for every user. I let you an example of a well designed repository that explain from the beginning how to use it (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience!\r\n\r\nFrancesco.
