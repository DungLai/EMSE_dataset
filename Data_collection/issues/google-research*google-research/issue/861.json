But I don't think the results of other models are containing so many artifacts like your exhibition in your paper if you retrain these models with compressed videos. I used to retrain EDVR and RSDN with compressed videos on CRF37, and the results are just over-smoothed instead of full of artifacts. Is it because something is wrong with my knowledge about that or you just use the trained model provided by their authors?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/861/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
