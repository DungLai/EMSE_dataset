E.g. in the `compute feature ranking()` in \"data_input.py\", the saliency map is regarded as a 3-channel map and the ranking is for each channel separately. \r\nIt means that for one pixel ( (x,y) coordinate) in an input image,  two of the channels could be removed but one channel left. Is that correct? \r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nBest,","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/684/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
