Do TFLite models converted to streaming mode (internal or external state) also work (in streaming mode) when used via [TF Lite CoreML delegate](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/coreml_delegate) on iOS devices? In this case, can `mfcc_op` be used on CoreML/iOS, or only `mfcc_tf` (or do speech feature extraction outside of the model)?\r\n@rybakov ","closed_by":{"login":"entn-at","id":10227168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI3MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10227168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at","html_url":"https://github.com/entn-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entn-at/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
