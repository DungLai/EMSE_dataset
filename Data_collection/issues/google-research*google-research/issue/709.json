I am greatly enjoying reading the code behind some of the great researches Google does.\r\n\r\nRecently, I noticed that Google announced VertexAI Matching Engine, in which they claimed that ScaNN is used inside of it. The documentation says one of the features of the engine is [boolean filtering](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/filtering), so naturally, I expected ScaNN in this repository also has that capability.\r\n\r\nI searched this repository and found some reminiscent of the features\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/scann/scann/proto/restricts.proto\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/scann/scann/coscann/v2_restricts.proto\r\nbut could not be sure whether the functionality is implemented completely.\r\n\r\nI want to ask\r\n1. whether boolean filtering is implemented in this ScaNN repository\r\n2. If implemented, I want to know how to use the feature.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Ktakuya332C","id":17094694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0Njk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17094694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C","html_url":"https://github.com/Ktakuya332C","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktakuya332C/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/709/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/709/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
