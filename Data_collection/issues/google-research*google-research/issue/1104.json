I'm currently trying to pretrain VATT on my own dataset. So far, I have converted my raw videos and text to TFRecords and have also made changes to `vatt/data/datasets/toy_dataset.py` as described [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/vatt#data).\r\n\r\nCan you please help me figure out what more do I need to do to get the pretraining running on my dataset? Would really be grateful!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1104/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
