It's simple to add an unknown class by just adding a 'unknown' folder in the dataset with a bunch of random audio files, however, this solution doesn't add silence clips, and it's tedious to make a directory full of silence clips. I've added a simple way to add silence in my own local copy of this repo. Was wondering if the authors of this repo would be interested in me turning this option into something that can be controlled with command line flags, and making a pull request for this feature? \r\n@rybakov\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrett","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
