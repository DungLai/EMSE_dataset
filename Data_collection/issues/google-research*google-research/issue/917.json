So I checked the source code [here](https://github.com/deepmind/dmvr/blob/master/dmvr/modalities.py), the **add_audio** function has no argument `preprocessor_builder` indeed.\r\n\r\nBesides, There is no argument `sample_rate`, `target_sample_rate` in **add_audio** too, but they are used in ./vatt/data/processing.py\", line 579.\r\n\r\nThe dmvr package I installed is version 0.0.1.\r\n\r\nIs something wrong with the vatt code? Or simply I did something wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Adam-fei","id":18185114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTg1MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18185114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei","html_url":"https://github.com/Adam-fei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adam-fei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/917/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
