I have read the paper, and I want to reproduce the performance using your code. However, I have some questions about the codes.\r\n\r\n1.   In the speech_commands.ipynb, I find that, the results are different  when I evaluate the model with different batch size. It might be casued by the batch norm, the batch norm is still in trianing mode when we evaluate the model. The same condition can be observed in the inference codes. Therefore, is this a bugï¼Ÿ\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHang","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
