Based on the content of the research paper and the equations in appendix B, I believe that S(x_u ; theta_T) should be T(x_u ; theta_T). If I am incorrect, would you mind providing me with an explanation as to why the student is using the teacher's weights?\r\nSecondly, I am having difficulty understanding how the variation of the log-gradient trick in the REINFORCE algorithm is applied to equation 10. Would you mind explaining how this log-gradient trick is used?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and an impressive paper!","closed_by":{"login":"DHdroid","id":43927732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTI3NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43927732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid","html_url":"https://github.com/DHdroid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DHdroid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/537/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
