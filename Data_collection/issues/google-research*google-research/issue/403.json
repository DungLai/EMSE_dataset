I ran `python configure.py` and followed the fixes on #342 (modified `.bazelrc`) and #363 (replaced all `#include <hash_set>`). But when I ran `bazel build`, I got the following errors:\r\n\r\n- `error: unknown type name '__m256'`\r\n- `error: use of undeclared identifier '_mm256_setzero_ps'; did you mean '_mm_setzero_ps'?`\r\n- `error: use of undeclared identifier '_mm256_loadu_ps'; did you mean '_mm_loadu_ps'?`\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\nI'm using bazel 3.5.0-homebrew on macOS Catalina 10.15.6.\r\n\r\nAny idea about this error?
