For example using electricity example, and if `total_time_steps` are 192 and `num_encoder_steps` are 168, I understand that the model uses 168 previous values to predict next 24 values (or their quantiles). But the input data i.e. `data` in line [1145](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/tft/libs/tft_model.py#L1145) has the shape `(450000, 192, 5)` while the `labels` have shape `(450000, 24, 5)`. However the last 24 values in `data` are exactly what the 24 values of `labels` are. For validation I ran following lines of code during debugging after line [1145](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/tft/libs/tft_model.py#L1145)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor i,j in zip(data[0, -24:, 0], labels[0]):\r\n    print(np.abs(np.subtract(i,j[0])))\r\n```\r\nand it only prints 0s. \r\n\r\nMy question is if we are required to feed the target values as inputs, then what is the point of having a model? What am I missing?
