Binary artifacts cannot be reviewed, allowing the introduction of possibly obsolete or maliciously subverted executables. For more information see the [Security Scorecards Documentation](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#binary-artifacts) for Binary Artifacts.\n\n**Remediation Steps**\nTo remediate, remove the generated executable artifacts from the repository.\n\n**Artifacts Found**\n\n- tf3d/ops/packages/tensorflow_sparse_conv_ops-0.0.1-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl\n- tf3d/ops/packages/tensorflow_sparse_conv_ops-0.0.1-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl\n\n**Additional Information**\nThis policy is drawn from [Security Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/), which is a tool that scores a project's adherence to security best practices. You may wish to run a Scorecards scan directly on this repository for more details.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Edit section #updates --><!-- Current result text hash: feface52d2a4640b94289888d28ee262f13a70f18bd7f62cb974571614eb0e8d --><!-- Edit section #updates -->\nAllstar has been installed on all Google managed GitHub orgs.
