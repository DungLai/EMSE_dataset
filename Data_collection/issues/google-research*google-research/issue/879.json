Both need behavior cloning to be run first. However, in the README documentation, it only mentioned running `train_offline.py`.  And it is different from BRAC, in BRAC, if BC is not run first BRAC cannot be run. Nevertheless, I could directly run `fbrc` without bc run before. \r\n    Can you clarify the usage?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
