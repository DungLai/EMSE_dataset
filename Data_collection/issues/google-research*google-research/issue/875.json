Till now, i haven't found a possibility to do so. \r\nIs there any opportunity to predict the series? \r\n\r\nMy idea so far was, to switch the loss to \"mse\" and change the data preparation. But I could not find a answer to the following question: Where and why are the target values processed to the shape \"3\" in z-direction? \r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\nHinnerk8","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
