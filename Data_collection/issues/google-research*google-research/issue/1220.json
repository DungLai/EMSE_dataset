Yelp/Google/Glassdoor/etc have a huge audience and it's impossible to cover all this flow of users and their opinions or reports only by internal instruments.\r\n\r\n**Profit for the user**: to pay money and not waste time on solving your specific (or not so) problem.\r\n\r\n**Profit for sites**: the effectiveness of solving external issues + templating requests according to the criteria of the site itself.\r\n\r\n_So, if someone likes the idea, please share your fascinating experience communicating with the support of one or another site._\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
