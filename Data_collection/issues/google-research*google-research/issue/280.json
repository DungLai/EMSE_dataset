I knew how to do it in Keras, something similar to what is suggested [here](https://keras.io/getting_started/faq/#how-can-i-obtain-the-output-of-an-intermediate-layer-feature-extraction). I am using state_of_sparsity folder of this repository. I tried to get the layers using _layers but it returns empty. \r\n\r\n```\r\ntranslate_model = registry.model(FLAGS.model)(hparams, Modes.EVAL)\r\ntf.print(translate_model._layers)\r\n```\r\nI have posted my question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61916210/how-can-i-obtain-the-output-of-an-intermediate-layer-feature-extraction-in-tens). I was wondering why _layers returns empty. Is there any other way of cutting tensor2tensor models at a specific layer or extracting intermediate values after infer?
