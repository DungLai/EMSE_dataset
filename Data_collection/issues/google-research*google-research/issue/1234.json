When you select the negative and positive pairs by the defined PSM and use contrasive loss function. How do you ensure the positive pair is valid? For example, as you sample pairs randomly, it is likely that all sampled pairs are not similar, but you have to select the most similar one among them as positive pair.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJiawei","closed_by":{"login":"Wangjw6","id":24927339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTI3MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24927339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6","html_url":"https://github.com/Wangjw6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangjw6/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
