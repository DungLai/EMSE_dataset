I had this question because irrespective of the different datasets, the code expects \"train.json\" as the input file ([source](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/layout-blt/input_pipeline.py#L149)). The different raw datasets doesnt have the same structure, hence these seems to be some pre-processing involved. It would be great if you could confirm the same. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(Btw, there is reference to xManager [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/layout-blt/main.py#L26).)
