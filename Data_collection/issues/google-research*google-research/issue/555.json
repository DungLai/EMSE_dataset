Would it work if there was more subsampling in the network and e.g. the input resolution to the slot attention was 7x7 or 14x14 (like you would get out of resnet18 with effecive stride=8)\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"vadimkantorov","id":1041752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDE3NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1041752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov","html_url":"https://github.com/vadimkantorov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vadimkantorov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
