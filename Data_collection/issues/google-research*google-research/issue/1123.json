I had been evaluating Scann few months back and came across this project: https://big-ann-benchmarks.com/ . I spent some time in coming up with the framework code for Scann and the PR can be found here https://github.com/vamossagar12/big-ann-benchmarks/tree/t1/scann. \r\nI couldn't get the time to continue on this further but before I did that, I realized I should ask it here.\r\nI am not a google employee so I am not quite sure if I should be proceeding with submitting for these evaluations without the consent of researchers at google. There are some deadlines for submission etc so wanted to understand if anybody from google research would be interested in participating in this ? If yes, then would it be a collaborative effort where I can also chime in or somebody from your side would pick this up? And if it's a no, then well I can also pause this effort :) ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
