I just have a question about uflow's training loss and training memory requirement. \r\n1. Training loss: in your final SOTA result, the losses you used are self-sup + smoothness + occ masking + photo loss as census loss, right? But I just have one question: all these losses are applied only on model output level, i,e, level 2 in your implementation or the losses are applied on all levels?\r\n2.  Since self-sup loss will engage after 50% of total iteration, how much memory will be required if using batch size of 1?\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to your reply. Thank you very much!\r\n\r\nBest,","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/615/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
