I am currently trying to work on TCC - Temporal Cycle-Consistency Learning - but there is a technical question I can't figure out.\r\nWhat exactly does the network sees? At first I thought it was pairs of videos of the same class, but the loss takes in account 1 batch of samples.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the loss is computed over all pairs of samples in the batch, but what is the condition on the samples of the batch? In particular, in the paper it is said that \"The core contribution of this work is a self-supervised\r\napproach to learn an embedding space where two similar\r\nvideo sequences can be aligned temporally.\". So I would find it weird to align 2 videos that aren't similar (like pouring/tennis serve).\r\n\r\nDo you know where in the code can I find information about such stuff? I am not really familiar with tensorflow :(","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
