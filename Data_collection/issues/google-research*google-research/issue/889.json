Its regularization scheme seems clever and effective.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not sure if this is the right place ask this question, I believe that [a conjugate gradient descent based algorithm](http://rs1.sze.hu/~gtakacs/download/recsys_2011_draft.pdf) to solve iALS problem has\r\n\r\n1. exactly the same computational complexity with iCD and iALS++ method.
