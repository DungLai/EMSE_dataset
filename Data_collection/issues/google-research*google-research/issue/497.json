The models are now fully ported to hugging face and the < xl/3b models can also be used on the inference API: https://huggingface.co/google/t5-large-ssm-nq?text=how+many+episodes+in+season+2+breaking+bad%3F\r\n\r\nAt the moment we use simple greedy search as the decoding algorithm for those models, but we could switch to beam search if it gives better performance. What is your opinion here? In case you found that beam search works better, could you post your suggested hyperparameters (max_length/min_length/num_beams/length_penalty). Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nHope it's ok to tag you here @adarob :-) \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/497/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
