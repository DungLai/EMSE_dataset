I'm trying to run MuZero on my laptop. According to your instructions, it should work with SEED RL however the instructions are not clear enough. It's not obvious where to put each file and which scripts to run.\r\n\r\nI managed to run MuZero with SEED RL in some way, but it's not working. All libraries load, variables are initialized, the training loop starts, but the actor freezes on GRPC call of initial_inference function. Here are logs from [learner](https://pastebin.com/aGQNNSdi) and [actor](https://pastebin.com/vgpm2KhQ)\r\n\r\nCould you provide more detailed instructions on how to run MuZero with SEED RL?\r\n\r\nI found out that requirements.txt of MuZero is missing three libraries (inflection, tf-agents, ale-py). This occurs when I try to run MuZero on Atari. I ran `pip install -r muzero/requirements.txt` inside [this](https://github.com/google-research/seed_rl/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile.atari) docker image and the code for MuZero did not load correctly unless I installed those 3 libraries.\r\n\r\nCould you provide an output of `pip freeze` of a python env in which MuZero runs correctly? I'm providing a `pip freeze` of my env [here](https://pastebin.com/2hXitfAZ).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/872/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/872/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
