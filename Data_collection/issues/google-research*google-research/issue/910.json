I think many researchers will want to use it with latest tensorflow. However, currently, tf3d is only supported for tensorflow 2.3.\r\n\r\nI read its build codes(WORKSPACE), and found comments for future works. For example,\r\n[https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/4a383cf4eef1144b5c711802393fd91407f38323/tf3d/ops/WORKSPACE#L77](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/4a383cf4eef1144b5c711802393fd91407f38323/tf3d/ops/WORKSPACE#L77)\r\n\r\nSo, I expect tf3d will be updated. Do you have such a plan?\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
