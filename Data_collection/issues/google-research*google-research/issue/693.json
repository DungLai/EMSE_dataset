As on repository it is mentioned that currently it supports only 3 datasets (waymo, rio and scannet).\r\nIf Yes, than please can any one help me in preparing .tfrecord with which i can train tf3d object detection model? As i don't have much experience in this filed.\r\n\r\nRight now i am able to train the tf3d object detection model with only following waymo dataset source:(gs://waymo_open_dataset_tf_example_tf3d/original_tfrecords/train-00000-of-01212.tfrecords .)\r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/693/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
