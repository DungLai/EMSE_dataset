However, I don't see it being used by any model. Since I am curious about this and would try it I guess, could someone explain for me why it is not used?\r\n\r\nIn addition, imo Depthwise Separable Conv may be the most efficient model for KWS due to its much less filters and memory access. Have you tried DSC+Resnet? It is worth noting that DSC+ResNet is SOTA in terms of efficiency[[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12200.pdf)[[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08531.pdf). Just wanna know the experiments you have done so that I could have some clue on how to do my research. Much appreciated!\r\n\r\nSorry for bothering @rybakov. I find that you are the main contributor for this project so it would be more efficient to ping you.","closed_by":{"login":"tu1258","id":59950011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTUwMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59950011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258","html_url":"https://github.com/tu1258","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tu1258/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
