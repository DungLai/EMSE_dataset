However, I have some trouble when attempting to run the jumping-task code. I've downloaded the code under this [dir](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/pse), and I've followed the README instruction and run `python -m jumping_task.train --train_dir . --training_epochs 1` under my `/pse` dir. \r\n\r\nHere is what I got:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/miniconda3/envs/pse/lib/python3.8/runpy.py\", line 194, in _run_module_as_main\r\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/miniconda3/envs/pse/lib/python3.8/runpy.py\", line 87, in _run_code\r\n    exec(code, run_globals)\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/RLgen/paperCode/pse/jumping_task/train.py\", line 417, in <module>\r\n    app.run(main)\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/miniconda3/envs/pse/lib/python3.8/site-packages/absl/app.py\", line 312, in run\r\n    _run_main(main, args)\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/miniconda3/envs/pse/lib/python3.8/site-packages/absl/app.py\", line 258, in _run_main\r\n    sys.exit(main(argv))\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/RLgen/paperCode/pse/jumping_task/train.py\", line 411, in main\r\n    train_agent(train_dir, measurements)\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/RLgen/paperCode/pse/jumping_task/train.py\", line 186, in train_agent\r\n    imitation_data = data_helpers.generate_imitation_data(\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/RLgen/paperCode/pse/jumping_task/data_helpers.py\", line 108, in generate_imitation_data\r\n    imitation_data[color_key] = _generate_imitation_data(\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/RLgen/paperCode/pse/jumping_task/data_helpers.py\", line 87, in _generate_imitation_data\r\n    observations, actions, rewards = generate_optimal_trajectory(\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/RLgen/paperCode/pse/jumping_task/data_helpers.py\", line 53, in generate_optimal_trajectory\r\n    initial_obs = env.environment._reset(  # pylint: disable=protected-access\r\n  File \"/home/dibbla/miniconda3/envs/pse/lib/python3.8/site-packages/gym/core.py\", line 235, in __getattr__\r\n    raise AttributeError(\r\nAttributeError: attempted to get missing private attribute '_reset'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like accessing a protected method in gym/core.
