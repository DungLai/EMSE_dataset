Thanks for the amazing works!\r\nI have one question in  `nonnegative_softmax_kernel_feature_creator`.\r\nI don't understand why `jnp.max` terms are used in `nonnegative_softmax_kernel_feature_creator` as below. I cannot find the corresponding equations in the original paper. Is it just for normalization? Is there a mathematical background? \r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/c249ee982c9ca3bb0cca4788758435c87c71fc7d/performer/fast_attention/jax/fast_attention.py#L101-L109\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/753/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/753/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
