Do you have advices or directions on how to set this up?\r\n\r\nMy idea is to separate partitioning and the AH search phase. I can do (re-)partitioning regularly as a batch job, store the results in a n external database. At prediction time, I could quickly fetch the partition I need by partition key, and perform AH search in real-time. Does this makes sense? \r\n\r\nIf this is a way to proceed do you have API for partitioning and for scoring separately? I only found joint function for nearest neighbours?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMarin","closed_by":{"login":"drljem","id":94973401,"node_id":"U_kgDOBakt2Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94973401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem","html_url":"https://github.com/drljem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drljem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
