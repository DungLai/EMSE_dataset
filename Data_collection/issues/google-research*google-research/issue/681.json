I would be grateful if you could share more details about the training/evaluation setting like the following: \r\n * I found that data records have also radial and tangential distortion parameters, Have you processed Waymo's data considering those distortions?\r\n * What is the input resolution of the model for Waymo's data? (480 * 196?)\r\n * Did you crop the input images so only the part of the image that has lidar ground truth is processed? (0.4 * height crop?)\r\n \r\nThank you for sharing the code of your work,\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/681/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
