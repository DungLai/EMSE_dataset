Does it contains student feedback, supervised gradient and UDA gradient all together? I tried to test MPL using only supervised loss and students feed back on this toy dataset, but did not get result as good as your paper.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/559/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
