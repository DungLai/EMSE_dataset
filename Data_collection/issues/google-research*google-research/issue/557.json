Arik, Nicolas Loeff, Tomas P\ffister) to solve a time-series forecasting problem. \r\n\r\nThe paper is well-written to understand and the codes can be found on this github.\r\n\r\nHowever, (as noticed in this title) I'm very confused because the output (labels, targets) is included in input dict.\r\nthere can be static covariates, history of target, etc., as inputs to predict the future target. \r\nBut, I found that the target (output) is included in input data. \r\n\r\nHow can it be possible? does it make sense?\r\n\r\nSincerely, ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/557/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
