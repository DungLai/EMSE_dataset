The hyperparameter is not mentioned in the [algorithms](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/scann/docs/algorithms.md) section. Should one leave it as default (e.g. `100000`) or stick to a value similar to the one from the example notebook (e.g. `250000`)? Does it depend on the dataset? In my case, I would like to build a ScaNN index on word embeddings with ~4M rows and 300 features.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/622/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
