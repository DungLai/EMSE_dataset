Predicted values are exactly same as that of Input target values. \r\nHow can we predict values for future timestamps?\r\nI also tried by adding a dummy row (target column/observed inputs/known inputs = 0 with future timestamp) as the last record in test data but TFT prediction model is just copy paste Input test data as predicted output values.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I am missing something.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ashishKAgg","id":5666238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjYyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg","html_url":"https://github.com/ashishKAgg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashishKAgg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/545/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
