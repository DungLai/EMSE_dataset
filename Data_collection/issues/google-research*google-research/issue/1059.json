The paper (arxiv version) specifies the following hyper-parameters for reproducing results (Section S8):\r\n\r\n- \"One network was trained for all five shapes of SYMSOL I\" (`--symsol_shapes symsol1`)\r\n- \"... with a batch size of 128 images\"\r\n- \"... for 100,000 steps\"\r\n- \"three positional encoding terms were used for the query\"\r\n- \"four fully connected layers of 256 units with ReLU activation for the MLP\"\r\n- Note that the paper also says that it renders 100k images for each shape. However, the `symmetric_solids` dataset in tfds only contains 50k images each, and that's what I train on.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding training run command is: \r\n```bash\r\npython -m implicit_pdf.train --symsol_shapes symsol1 \\\r\n --number_fourier_components 3 \\\r\n --batch_size 128 \\\r\n --number_training_iterations 100000 \\\r\n --head_network_specs 256 --head_network_specs 256 --head_network_specs 256 --head_network_specs 256 \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the trained model seems to be overfitting as `gt_log_likelihood` starts reducing for `cyl` and `cone` after ~3k iterations. Please see the [uploaded tensorboard logs](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/PLJkBENPR6aqG7VwJqzWAQ/). Reducing the depth of the MLP network to the default 2 layers didn't help either. \r\n\r\nThanks and Regards,\r\nShubham","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1059/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1059/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
