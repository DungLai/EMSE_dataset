Definitely one of the best papers I've read this summer.\r\n\r\nI need help running it though:\r\n1. AFAIK, there are no pre-trained models shared, are there?\r\n2. Looking at the [poem](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/poem) code, we have the training code, and it uses a sample tfrecords file, namely `poem/testdata/tfe-2.tfrecords`. Is there a full version of this file?
