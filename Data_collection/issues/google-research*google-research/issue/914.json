I would like to use it to expand the capabilities and even train with additional data for specific IQA instances.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it appears that this code is for doing a prediction using one of the model checkpoints created from the competitive datasets.  I would like to train the approach on some unique datasets and train it further.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think I may be able to come up with the code to train a model based on the paper, I wanted to see if you would be willing to release your training scripts as well so I could train new datasets quicker.
