Issue #162  is about this problem. There is an important bug in CUDA 10.0, and the related tensorflow 1.x (x>=13.1) binaries are built with CUDA 10.0. We built tensorflow 14.0 with CUDA 10.1. It works that way. Or you can try the training only on CPU. :)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @suvigy in https://github.com/google-research/google-research/issues/130#issuecomment-611591025_","closed_by":{"login":"poornimajd","id":31023599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDIzNTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31023599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd","html_url":"https://github.com/poornimajd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornimajd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
