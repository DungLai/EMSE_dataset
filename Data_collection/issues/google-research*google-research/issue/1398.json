Thanks for the released code.\r\nThere are some problems about model MACs.\r\nI try to compute the flops of lightweight vct in one training step, with batch size 1, frame dimension (1920*1080) and the num_frame I set 3 here. Then I calculate 1.19b flops in just one training step.\r\nIs that correct? As I increase the num_frames, the flops won't increase a lot. So I'm not sure whether the flops of this released lightweight model is actually correct.\r\nFinally, how can I accurately compute the MACs on every module?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
