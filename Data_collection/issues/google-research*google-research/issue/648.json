Why are Q and K the same (byproduct of random setting random seed to 0). Interestingly even though K uses the same seed the result is different (because different shape?). \r\n2. Why is `nb_random_features` set to 10000. Is this just to verify the approximation works at all? Obviously the whole point of the FAVOR mechanism allows `nb_random_features` << sequence length.\r\n\r\nContext: I think this is wonderful and I'm working on notebook(s) for https://plutojl.org/plutocon2021 with the aim explaining FAVOR in an accessible way.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
