I also notice than in the paper, you said \"For Reddit, a 4-layer GCN with 128 hidden units is used\" while in .sh file, the number of hidden units is 512 as the default value. I'm wondering if it is the reason and I'm doing experiment to verify this guess.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
