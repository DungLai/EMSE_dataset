The alignment vectors I get based on the reference video cannot overlap.  Do you have any visual skills for setting up?  Another question, I would like to ask for the annotation of Penn-action, get the json file of your thesis, what kind of annotation tool can be used for you, and how to get the json file, I hope to get your help.I hope you can reply and urgently need your help.....@debidatta ","closed_by":{"login":"hubin111","id":29574262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc0MjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29574262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111","html_url":"https://github.com/hubin111","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hubin111/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/154/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
