When I tried inference with other resolutions it doesn't work well at all.\r\n\r\nIf it's indeed 416x128, have you tried training with higher resolutions? I know some previous work use 416x128 for training, but recently most methods use higher resolutions and experiments have demonstrated higher resolutions lead to better results. Is it something related to the GPU memory issue?","closed_by":{"login":"kwea123","id":11364490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY0NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11364490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123","html_url":"https://github.com/kwea123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwea123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/61/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/61/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
