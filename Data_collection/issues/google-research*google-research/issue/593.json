I adapted my custom datasets to .npz format and use notebook (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/dvrl/main_dvrl_image_transfer_learning.ipynb). \r\nI have tried to use DVRL for 2 cases:\r\n1. choosing the best described images by model,\r\n2. choosing the best synthetic data\r\n\r\n \r\n1. In this problem I have many described by model photos and some data described by human. My assumption was that data described by human has better quality than desribed by model and dvrl model should can pick up the best  photos from train set. Valid and test is from the same distribution, splited to 2 sets. Datsets:\r\ntrain = 191443 - data described by model, I assume this set has lower quality than valid and train\r\nvalid = 3639 - data described by human, I assume this set has high quality\r\ntest = 8268 - data described by human, I assume this set has high quality\r\n\r\nFirst of all, is it possible for dvrl to choose data which are wrong described by model? What do you mean by low quality, is it only jitter on photos, or it could be my case (wrong described photos by model, for instance wrong class)?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In this problem I have synthetic data generated by GAN in train dataset. Valid and test has same distribution splited to 2 sets. Valid and test are real photos, not synthetic.\r\n \r\ntrain = 1132 - generated by gan\r\nvalid = 35 - real data\r\ntest = 40 - real data\r\nNumber of classes: 4\r\n\r\nDoes dvrl could choose high quality synthetic data, based on real photos included in valid and test set? It is possible that my valid and test set are to small?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/593/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
