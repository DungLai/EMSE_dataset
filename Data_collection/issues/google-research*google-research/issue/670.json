I have a question about running PSE on dm-control. The following command ran fine, i.e. when contrastive_loss_weight was set to zero.\r\n\r\n`python -m pse.dm_control.run_train_eval\r\n        --trial_id=1\r\n        --seed 0\r\n        --env_name=cartpole-swingup\r\n        --root_dir=/tmp/drq\r\n        --num_train_steps=10000\r\n        --eval_interval=25\r\n        --policy_save_interval=50\r\n        --checkpoint_interval=100\r\n        --gin_bindings=\"load_dm_env_for_eval.action_repeat=8\"\r\n        --contrastive_loss_weight=0\r\n        --gin_bindings=\"drq_agent.train_eval.initial_collect_steps=300\"\r\n        --gin_bindings=\"drq_agent.train_eval.eval_episodes_per_run=1\"\r\n        --alsologtostderr`\r\n\r\nThen I followed the instructions to download and configure distracting_control and the dataset for cartpole-swingup and set `contrastive_loss_weight` to 1.0. The training script failed because when it isn't 0, it needs `data_dir` to load the episode data from the dataset I downloaded from the GCP bucket. It's a simple fix. No problem. But the training still failed with the following exception:\r\n\r\n`tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Cannot place the graph because a reference or resource edge connects colocation groups with incompatible assigned devices: /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 vs /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0. The edge src node is Func/StatefulPartitionedCall/Losses_1/contrastive_loss/write_summary/summary_cond/StatefulPartitionedCall/input/_1059 , and the dst node is StatefulPartitionedCall/Losses_1/contrastive_loss/write_summary/summary_cond/StatefulPartitionedCall/Losses_1/contrastive_loss/write_summary/summary_cond [Op:__inference__train_27434]\r\n`\r\n\r\nAny idea on how to fix this? Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
