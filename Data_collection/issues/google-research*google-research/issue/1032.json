How does the demo then support real-time processing at 25 fps (i.e. < 40 ms delay per frame)? Is the 300 ms latency for heavy ResNet based versions?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
