I can see that there is no separate inference script. Which is the proposed way to run prediction?\r\n - Should the depth_motion_field_model.py (function infer_depth(rgb_image, params) ) be applied and somehow  the input batch passed to it? Normalized?\r\n - Like at the depth_from_videos_in_the_wild,  one should use and slightly modify the inference script from struct2depth project? (signiture of infer_depth is now quite different as it was earlier with inference_depth(im_batch, sess) ).\r\n\r\nBEst Regards\r\n Gy√∂rgy ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
