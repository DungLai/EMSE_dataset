Thank you very much for this project and your awesome work on it!\r\n\r\nI've been reading the implementation of the M-DQN and M-IQN and found that the log-policy clipping is applied differently.\r\nIn the original paper authors clip this member between [lo, 0], where lo is hyperparameter.\r\nIn M-IQN it [looks correct](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/munchausen_rl/agents/m_iqn.py#L310), but in the M-DQN the value is [clipped in [lo, 1]](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/munchausen_rl/agents/m_dqn.py#L156).\r\nProbably I'm missing something, so if this is not a bug, could you please give some details about why you use 1 as a max clipping value?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
