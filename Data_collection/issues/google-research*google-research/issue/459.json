My trained model appears to be doing as well as can be expected, given how aberrant the pandemic trends have been in the US; however, I'm wondering if TFT necessitates stationarity transformations in this case or if the sequential attention is able to learn to deal with this on its own fairly effectively (given that obviously the more feature engineering that is done can help improve model performance but then again part of the appeal of TFT is that one can avoid much of that work through the model).\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts.
