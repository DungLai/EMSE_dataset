This issue is specifically about the finetuneing code for the downstream tasks.\r\n\r\nI image there must exist code somewhere that loaded the dataset jsons and fed them into a BERT training loop, and then evaluated at the end. Could this code be released? (Apologies if I'm missing something if it's already there). It might be just be something that is hacked on top a fork of the BERT repo, and if that's the case, that's totally fine. It'd be really useful to see.\r\n\r\nThis is not just trivial implementation as some choices like how long functions (> 512 tokens) were finetuned/evaluated might effect downstream performance (I assume just truncating?). This makes it somewhat complicated to recreate/benchmark against CuBERT in followup research I am doing without the source.\r\n\r\nSee also issue #571 about instructions about using the finetuned models (but not necessarily creating them). Related also is my issue  #581 for missing CuBERT code for the pretraining corpus deduping (which could also be helped with the release of more of the original source).\r\n\r\nCC: @adityakanade @maniatis","closed_by":{"login":"DNGros","id":5520022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5520022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros","html_url":"https://github.com/DNGros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DNGros/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
