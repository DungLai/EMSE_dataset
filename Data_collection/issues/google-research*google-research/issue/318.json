It doesn't seem to be so on first glance since the OOD test and validation datasets seem to be ~6x larger than the corresponding in-distribution datasets - if all cases had the same number of sequences, then they should be all the same size.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that the provided google drive actually contains all of the data, and from this dataset 100,000 sequences were subsampled per class for performing the experiments in the paper. Does a class here mean a bacterial name such as \"Actinoplanes, Advenella\" etc? Is there a script or function that performs this random sampling that I can use?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. The dataset and experiments are very comprehensive and interesting. It would be great if I could have a little more clarity on these minor details.\r\n\r\nBest Regards","closed_by":{"login":"anands-repo","id":13801024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAxMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13801024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo","html_url":"https://github.com/anands-repo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anands-repo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
