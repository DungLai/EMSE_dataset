The question I have is since one of the tasks I need done is MLM while the other is classification, and they're done by different models (in ELECTRA the generator and discriminator respectively), can they be used as teachers for BAM? Because as I understand from the paper the teachers must have the exact same model archtecture as each other and as the student, and in this case the generator and discriminator are different models.\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
