I thought that anisotropic quantization was used to quantize subsets of each data(50 subsets per data) to one centroid among 16 centroids in each blocks(50 blocks), but the output of hashed_dataset is the same as I change the parameter score_ah(2, anisotropic_quantization_threshold = 0.2) to score_ah(2).
