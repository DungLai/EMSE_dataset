One question: In order for it to fit in the Seq2Seq model, you need to create attention mechansim between encoder-decoder. Bert/GPT2 is pretty much using self-attention. I cannot find any source code on this since you guys release the trained models. Can you share that piece of code/design ideas? \r\n\r\nFor Summary task: \r\nI saw on the shared models that it directly outputs the summary. Can I know if there is a way to finetune the model base on our data? https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/bertseq2seq","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/433/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
