However, I can’t get a proper warped image T+1 WITHOUT scaling the translation vector.  After some trial and error, I found that the scale factor for the translation vector is about 0.001. \r\n\r\nTherefore, my question is: do you need such a scaling factor for the translation vector when you try to project image T to image T+1 (or inversely) to compute the reconstruction loss? I am quite confused as I understand the predicted depth’s scale and the predicted egomotion’s scale should be matched and thus we should be able to do reconstruction without scaling those variables.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.
