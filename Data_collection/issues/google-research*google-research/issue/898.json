After the training process, I exported the model which resulted in a new folder containing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariables/\r\nsaved_model.pb\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then tried several loading mechanisms, e.g. with Keras, but in every case I observed errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING:tensorflow:Unable to create a python object for variable <tf.Variable 'bert/encoder/layer_11/output/LayerNorm/gamma:0' shape=(768,) dtype=float32_ref> because it is a reference variable. It may not be visible to training APIs. If this is a problem, consider rebuilding the SavedModel after running tf.compat.v1.enable_resource_variables().\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that there are additional ressources that have to be loaded to actually use the exported model. \r\n\r\nCan you briefly explain how to do so?\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nJulian","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/898/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
