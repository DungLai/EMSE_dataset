(or nearly the same)\r\n\r\n1. Should I use the appropriate instruction when configuring the prompt? \r\n    ex) `\"After reading this passage, I have a question: {question}? True or False?\"` for SuperGLUE-boolq\r\n2. Did you use the sentinel token when running few-shot experiment just like one in a pre-trained manner?\r\n3. Should I do any post-processing like normalization? \r\n    ex) As far as I know, in the GPT-3 paper, authors normalized the unconditional probability of each completion, by computing `{P(completion|context)/P(completion|answer context)}`.\r\n4. For SuperGLUE tasks, did you use perplexity to decide the best option?\r\n5. For XSUM task, what decoding strategy did you use? \r\n    ex) simple greedy decoding, beam search, ... \r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
