But is a similar thing possible for Rouge-N variations?\r\nRight now looking at the code, I can't help but conclude that it is not. So I was wondering, was that a conscious decision to not make it an option? Would something like that make no sense to compute? \r\n\r\nUltimately, I am interested in computing Rouge-2 and Rouge-3 with 1 candidate sentence and multiple references. Right now I'm looking at calculating pairwise scores between the candidate and all references and then average out the result. \r\nI was wondering if the way `rougeLsum` does it would be a better choice and if it's possible using the current state of the code.
