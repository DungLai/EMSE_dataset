I have some questions and hopefully you will get back to me.\r\n\r\n1. What is the general purpose and significance of this [Auto_mask](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/88d2083a36cc0566585ed4e431534f9e3db0b312/depth_and_motion_learning/object_motion_nets.py#L212)? Why do you compute the mean_sq_residual_translation over all residual translations in the batches instead of independent mean_sq_residual_translation for each residual translation in the batch? If I recall correctly then the 0th dimension should have batch, and this [line](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/88d2083a36cc0566585ed4e431534f9e3db0b312/depth_and_motion_learning/object_motion_nets.py#L215) will take the mean over the entire batch. \r\n\r\n2. I tried training your object motion model on the Kitti data set but the residual translations in some images were not sparse which affected the entire performance of the model. How can I change alpha and beta in the motion regularization to make them more sparse and constant throughout a moving object? \r\n\r\n3. Did you try predicting object motion without using depth information? If so, how were the results? Do you think its possible to extract motion maps without using depth since this method requires us to predict depth for 2 frames?\r\n\r\n4. Is your method extendable to an \"n\" frame sequence like in other methods? Did you try 3 frames?\r\n\r\nThanks !","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/551/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
