OSS-Fuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project. OSS-Fuzz will:\r\n\r\n- Continuously run at scale all the fuzzers you write.\r\n- Alert you when it finds issues.\r\n- Automatically close issues after they’ve been fixed by a commit.\r\n\r\nMany widely used [open source projects]( https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects ) like OpenSSL, FFmpeg, LibreOffice, and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSS-Fuzz, which helps them find and remediate [critical issues]( https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?can=1&q=status%3AFixed%2CVerified+Type%3ABug%2CBug-Security+-component%3AInfra+ ). \r\n\r\nEven though typical integrations can be done in < 100 LoC, we have a [reward program]( https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/ ) in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source, but are also working hard to make it more secure.\r\n\r\nWe want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSS-Fuzz is eligible for a reward.\r\n\r\nIf you're not interested in integrating with OSS-Fuzz, it would be helpful for us to understand why—lack of interest, lack of time, or something else—so we can better support projects like yours in the future.\r\n\r\nIf we’ve missed your question in our [FAQ]( https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/faq/ ), feel free to reply or reach out to us at oss-fuzz-outreach@googlegroups.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTommy\r\nOSS-Fuzz Team\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
