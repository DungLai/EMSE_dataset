However after a while (always different number of steps), the box classification value becomes NaN (see picture).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17144445/111959683-117aa800-8aef-11eb-908f-bb667fb3b56b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever there is no error message whatsoever and the training continuous, expect that the total loss also turns into a NaN respectively. I'm not sure what causes this. Does anyone have experienced something similar ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nMax","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
