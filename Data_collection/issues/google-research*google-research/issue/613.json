When I feed the model with  FlyingThings data I obtain correct and sharp disparity predictions. Nevertheless, if I feed it KITTI data, I obtain incredibly wrong outputs, not even close to the expected predictions.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason your model does not work with images from a different dataset? Do I have to apply some sort of preprocessing before feeding the data to the network?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nSergio","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/613/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
