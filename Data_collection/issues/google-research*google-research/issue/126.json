Many thanks for the interesting research!\r\nThe paper states:\r\n> Networks with 3 or more layers are trained by fine-tuning using the parameters from the depth before (e.g., the 12-layer network parameters are fine-tuned from the checkpoint of the 6-layer network parameters).\r\n\r\nI was wondering if this is deemed mandatory for the model to converge or was this simply a time saving mechanism to avoid starting from scratch?\r\n\r\nAny insights would be great!\r\nMany thanks,\r\nDom","closed_by":{"login":"DomHudson","id":10864294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY0Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10864294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson","html_url":"https://github.com/DomHudson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomHudson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
