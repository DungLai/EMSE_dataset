My data is very sparse and I was under the impression that the sparse conv 3d block could help. \r\n\r\nI don't have access to the dataset to run your examples yet, so I only looked at your test cases, but I am not really getting how voxel_feature, voxel_indices, num_valid_voxels works. Do you have additional explanations on what they are and how they are related ? \r\nAlso, probably none of the sparse layers would work with my data format, right ?  \r\n\r\nBest, ","closed_by":{"login":"StephaneKazmierczak","id":6080232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODAyMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6080232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak","html_url":"https://github.com/StephaneKazmierczak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephaneKazmierczak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
