But i have some confuse about loss function.\r\n\r\nif we have a minibath data: A， A1，A2，A3，B，C，D，E. Ai belongs to one class, and B, C, D, E belongs other 4 class.\r\n\r\nthe paper said eq2 let more positive data pair contribute to loss function, and positive pair (such as A•A1, A•A2, A•A3)  becomes lager, negtive pair  (such as: A•B, A•C, A•D) becomes smaller.\r\n\r\nThe eq2 indicate that the numerator inside log still only have one positive data pair and the denominator have all positive and negtive pair each calculate.\r\n\r\nIf A is anchor, A1，A2，A3 are positive data, and B，C，D，E are negtive data. the part of eq2 is： \r\n（log（A•A1 / ( A•A1 + A•A2 + A•A3 + A•B + A•C + A•D + A•E）+ \r\n    log（A•A2 / ( A•A1 + A•A2 + A•A3 + A•B + A•C + A•D + A•E）+ \r\n    log（A•A3 / ( A•A1 + A•A2 + A•A3 + A•B + A•C + A•D + A•E））/ 3 \r\n\r\n\r\nthen, when loss is going down, the numerator (such as A•A1) in log is going to get bigger and the denominator is going to get samller. Is that correct? It seems like every elements in denominator is going to get smaller expect A•A1. So that means A•A2, A•A3 in denominator are going to get smaller？Logically, the values of A•A2, A•A3 should be larger.\r\n\r\nI'm confused about this.\r\nlooking forward to your replies! \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/1024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
