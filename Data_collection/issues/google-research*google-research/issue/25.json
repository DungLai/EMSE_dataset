Looking into the code you do some sort of bootstrap aggregation while in the original paper here (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1013) in section 2 looks like they do simple micro-averaging while in section 2.1 it seems they do maximization over pairewise computation in rouge!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMP\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
