But I found that using tools/gen_train_tfrecords.py did not save any negative pairs. And in train_base.py, the contents of \"anchor_keypoints\" and \"match_keypoints\" in triplet_loss are exactly the same (I found sum(anchor_keypoints-match_keypoints) == 0).\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/poem/train_base.py#L601\r\n\r\n Since there is no evaluation script, it is currently impossible to judge whether the training is correct. So where is \"Online Mining\" method reflected in the paper? \r\nLooking forward to your reply.","closed_by":{"login":"horsetif","id":27015574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE1NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27015574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif","html_url":"https://github.com/horsetif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horsetif/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
