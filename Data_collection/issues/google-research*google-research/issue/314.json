The work includes methods for doing SIMD lookup for larger tables thus allowing more precise distance (than with 16-values tables as done your work) while keeping the advantage of SIMD using recently-released AVX512-capable processors. I believe the method could be applied to scannn similarly to how QuickerADC extends QuickADC. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/nlescoua/faiss-quickeradc for source code.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding paper is available as preprint: IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence\r\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8896060\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09162\r\n\r\nBest regards","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/google-research/issues/314/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
