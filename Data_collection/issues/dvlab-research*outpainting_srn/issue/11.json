To train from scratch, I rebuild it using PyTorch, and directly copy pytorch/model/{layer,loss}.py and pytorch/util/ from [inpainting_gmcnn](https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/tree/master/pytorch/model) to compute mrf loss. \r\n\r\nBut whenever mrf_loss is included, the generator seems to quickly black out the image. I wonder if those files from inpainting_gmcnn is compatible to calculate mrf_loss? And if there is any detailed explanation about how the vgg19 features are used to compare?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the model is trained without mrf loss, the texture is bad.
