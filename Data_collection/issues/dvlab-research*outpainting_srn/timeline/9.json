To what extent can the first stage of training be identified as convergence？thanks for your help\r\n\r\nWe can ensure the training is converged when the reconstruction loss seems stable in the first stage. Quantitatively, for a relatively small-scale dataset (e.g. Paris street view, cityscapes) contains 2k~12k training images, 80000 iterations with batch size 16 should be enough (larger batch size may require fewer training iterations).\r\n\r\nThe two-stage training is actually a compromise due to the used network only has a small capacity (no more than 4M parameters). If training the model with a large capacity equipped with residual blocks  (like SPADE or Pix2pixHD) and new GAN stable tricks (spectral norm, multiple-scale, patchgan, condition projection, etc), it may be trained directly with vgg loss and adversarial loss from scratch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dvlab-research/outpainting_srn/issues/comments/683308894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shepnerd","id":5066504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5066504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd","html_url":"https://github.com/shepnerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepnerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dvlab-research/outpainting_srn/issues/comments/685661675","html_url":"https://github.com/dvlab-research/outpainting_srn/issues/9#issuecomment-685661675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dvlab-research/outpainting_srn/issues/9","id":685661675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTY2MTY3NQ==","user":{"login":"lilili666-hit","id":65395821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk1ODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65395821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit","html_url":"https://github.com/lilili666-hit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilili666-hit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-02T11:27:38Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T11:27:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n![11111111111111111111111](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65395821/91975681-55c07980-ed52-11ea-8e59-cd619ea374ca.png)\r\n \r\n\r\n Is the loss function image of this discriminator normal?
