Can I make Segmentation video? \r\nIn camera modes -> modes = ['normal', 'seg_class', 'surf_normals'] so I can make seg_class capture. but in video..?\r\n\r\n2. Can i make low view video? \r\nIn comm, render_script has [automatic (AUTO), first person (FIRST_PERSON), top (PERSON_TOP)] view. Can i set the camera mode? like puppy's sight?\r\n\r\n3.
