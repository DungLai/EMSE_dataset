I noticed that the file real_train.npz has a key called \"filenames\" containing _['Output_scripts_batch2/script_gen_000049'\r\n 'Output_scripts_batch2/script_gen_000144' .. etc ]_ , but was not able to locate these files within the zip folder.\r\n2. The paper mentions that VirtualHome Activity Dataset only contains  the 12 most frequent actions, however I found 75 unique actions under the real_train.npz file's \"actions\" key. \r\n3. If I want to use this provided dataset to initialise the environment and execute on the simulator, is there a way to get the corresponding graph states that you used for your data generation?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kswain98","id":56013904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDEzOTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56013904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98","html_url":"https://github.com/kswain98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kswain98/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/60/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/60/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
