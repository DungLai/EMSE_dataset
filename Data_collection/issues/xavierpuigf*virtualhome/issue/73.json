I am playing around with the ``unity_demo.ipynb`` file but encountered a problem.\r\n\r\nIs it correct that the visualized scenes are all the same (as shown in the image below), even the ``scene_id`` are different? I've checked ``comm.reset(scene_id)``, and surprisingly found it would return ``False`` no matter what ``scene_id`` I input. \r\n\r\nI am using the MacOS version simulator ``macos_exec.2.2.4``. Looking forward to your reply! Thanks!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68929040/169032219-3bf871a5-2845-4b28-bd09-eb9ce75ee2ba.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"xwhjy","id":68929040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTI5MDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68929040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy","html_url":"https://github.com/xwhjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwhjy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/73/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/73/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
