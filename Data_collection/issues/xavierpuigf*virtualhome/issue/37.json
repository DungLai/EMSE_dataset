Can you shed some light on the definition of them?\r\n\r\n1. what the difference between `obj_transform['position']` and `bounding_box['center']`?\r\n2. `obj_transform['rotation']` is a list with four float numbers. However, the official doc says it is a three-item list with â€“ pitch, yaw, roll. [here](http://virtual-home.org/documentation/kb/environments.html?highlight=rotation)\r\n3. Does the `bounding_box['size']` is an axis-aligned size or sort of real (width, length, height)?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nYinyu","closed_by":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
