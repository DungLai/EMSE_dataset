I am not able to use the `reset` function with the parameter `environment_graph`. The execution seems to fail at `comm.expand_scene` routine.\r\n\r\nFor example, I used the following setting\r\ni. executable program path: `programs_processed_precond_nograb_morepreconds/executable_programs/TrimmedTestScene3_graph/results_intentions_march-13-18/file425_2.txt`\r\nii. init_graph : `programs_processed_precond_nograb_morepreconds/init_and_final_graphs/TrimmedTestScene3_graph/results_intentions_march-13-18/file425_2.json`\r\n\r\nIf I try to reset the environment using the above init_graph, it throws an error:\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```\r\ngraph = json.load(open(graph_path)) \r\ninit_graph = graph['init_graph'] \r\nenv.reset(environment_id=0, environment_graph=init_graph)\r\n```\r\n\r\nError:\r\n```\r\nMessage Error processing input graph: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you please advise on how to fix this? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for sharing your work! \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"anisha2102","id":29476572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDc2NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29476572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102","html_url":"https://github.com/anisha2102","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisha2102/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
