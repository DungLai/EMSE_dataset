This is most likely because the unity simulator is just not running. Notice that the default mode is manual, this means you need to open the simulator first. Have you made sure the simulator is running before running that cell in the demo?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/927166762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5360105549,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCpYwC847jDVqzwAAAAE_fLhN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/5360105549","actor":{"login":"ddevleena","id":44735800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzM1ODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44735800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena","html_url":"https://github.com/ddevleena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-25T18:47:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5360105551,"node_id":"SE_lADOCpYwC847jDVqzwAAAAE_fLhP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/5360105551","actor":{"login":"ddevleena","id":44735800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzM1ODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44735800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena","html_url":"https://github.com/ddevleena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevleena/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-25T18:47:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/932755361","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/42#issuecomment-932755361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/42","id":932755361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpYwC843mLeh","user":{"login":"YoheiKakiuchi","id":2408164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2408164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi","html_url":"https://github.com/YoheiKakiuchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YoheiKakiuchi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-02T13:50:03Z","updated_at":"2021-10-02T13:50:03Z","author_association":"NONE","bo
