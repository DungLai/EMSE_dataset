@sgdgp,\r\n\r\nThe message you obtained is saying that some of the objects failed to be included in the scene. This is because some of the objects that appear in the dataset of scripts do not exist in the Unity executable.

Those objects serve as background objects and should not modify the behavior of the script that is being executed.\r\n\r\n@wetoo-cando , that is right, you need to use evolve_graph in order to generate those folders.
