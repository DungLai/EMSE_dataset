Could you try tendering only the first element in the script? You can set script = [script[0]]. If this runs well and generates the video, you may need to reduce the quality of the video you are generating, or it's framerate. Some of the things you can try to generate the whole script.\r\n\r\n- Run the executable with a lower quality. Check out screen-quality [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html). Options are -Fastest -Fast -Simple -Good -Beautiful -Fantastic\r\n- Reduce the frame height and width \r\n- Lower the frame_rate: set the flag frame_rate to e.g. 10 in render_script\r\n\r\nLet me know if that works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/507456832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2452676325,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ1MjY3NjMyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/2452676325","actor":{"login":"jolinxql","id":5552657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTI2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5552657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql","html_url":"https://github.com/jolinxql","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-01T23:07:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2452676328,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NTI2NzYzMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/2452676328","actor":{"login":"jolinxql","id":5552657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTI2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5552657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql","html_url":"https://github.com/jolinxql","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-01T23:07:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/507472563","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/2#issuecomment-507472563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/2","id":507472563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzQ3MjU2Mw==","user":{"login":"jolinxql","id":5552657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTI2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5552657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql","html_url":"https://github.com/jolinxql","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolinxql/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T00:30:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T00:30:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
