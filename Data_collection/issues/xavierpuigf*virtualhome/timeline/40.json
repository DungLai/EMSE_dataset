There seems to be an issue on github with http urls. If you copy that link on the browser, you will see that the link downloads. You will notice that the 2 links are actually the same.\r\n2. VirtualHome should be runnable on windows too, but it is true that the file_name option might not work there. Could you try opening the simulator by double clicking on it (after downloading), and leaving the `file_name` blank? This will assume that the simulator is open.
