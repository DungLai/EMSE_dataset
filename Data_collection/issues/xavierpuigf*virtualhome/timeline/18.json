The use case you are mentioning is included in VirtualHome. You need to run the function `render_script`, shown here: https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/blob/master/simulation/unity_simulator/comm_unity.py#L235\r\n\r\nThe field `image_synthesis` indicates the modality you want to save the frames in: you can save optical flow, rgb, semantic segmentation etc at the same time. `camera_mode` indicates the camera in which you want to render the scripts. Finally, to save the 3d keypoints, you can just run `save_pose_data`. It will save the keypoints of the characters in your videos, for every frame.\r\n\r\nHope this helped!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/760507217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4208432121,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIwODQzMjEyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/4208432121","actor":{"login":"snitchjinx","id":20622683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjIyNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20622683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx","html_url":"https://github.com/snitchjinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-14T22:09:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4208432124,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMDg0MzIxMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/4208432124","actor":{"login":"snitchjinx","id":20622683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjIyNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20622683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx","html_url":"https://github.com/snitchjinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-14T22:09:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/760848577","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/18#issuecomment-760848577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/18","id":760848577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDg0ODU3Nw==","user":{"login":"snitchjinx","id":20622683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjIyNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20622683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx","html_url":"https://github.com/snitchjinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitchjinx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-15T10:50:27Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T10:50:53Z","author_assoc
