Notice that in videos, you can actually generate videos from multiple cameras at the same time. You can see how this is done in the demo code.\r\n\r\nCurrently you can add static cameras in the scene and generate from those (indicating the camera number), or you can generate videos from the character cameras, which include:\r\n`[FIRST_PERSON, PERSON_TOP, PERSON_FROM_BACK, PERSON_FROM_LEFT, PERSON_FRONT]`\r\n\r\nI may add if needed a way to add new cameras that are attached to the character.\r\n\r\nThe data you are pointing to allows to generate images, but not videos unfortunately. You can generate videos though with the data from our latest watch and help paper: http://virtual-home.org/release/watch_and_help/watch_data.zip. You will see a sequence of programs that you can render and obtain semantic segmentation. From there you can train a model for object detection.\r\n\r\nHope this helps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/770048680/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4268036209,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI2ODAzNjIwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/4268036209","actor":{"login":"yunsujeon","id":38097792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk3Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38097792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon","html_url":"https://github.com/yunsujeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-29T21:03:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4268036220,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNjgwMzYyMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/4268036220","actor":{"login":"yunsujeon","id":38097792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk3Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38097792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon","html_url":"https://github.com/yunsujeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-29T21:03:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/770492285","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/24#issuecomment-770492285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/24","id":770492285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDQ5MjI4NQ==","user":{"login":"yunsujeon","id":38097792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk3Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38097792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon","html_url":"https://github.com/yunsujeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunsujeon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T00:53:37Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T00:53:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
