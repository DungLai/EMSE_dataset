Answering to your specific questions below:\r\n\r\n1. `obj_transform` refers to the transformation of the object in the scene, from object coordinates to world coordinates, whereas `bounding_box` refers to the information of the object bounding_box, in world coordinates. If the object has the origin at the center, then these 2 values will be the same. You can find the object origin and size information on this file:\r\nhttps://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/blob/master/resources/prefabs_dims.json\r\n\r\n2. I got the documentation wrong, I will correct shortly. The object rotation is given in Quaternions, rather than in euler angles, you can find the reasons here: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html. And here is some info to how to convert this to euler angles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_quaternions_and_Euler_angles\r\n\r\n3. The bounding box size is axis aligned. You should be able to retrieve the real size by rotation the vector created by `size` according to obj_transform['rotation'].\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/896923145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5143044314,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE0MzA0NDMxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/5143044314","actor":{"login":"yinyunie","id":25686434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Njg2NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25686434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie","html_url":"https://github.com/yinyunie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T15:26:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5143044319,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNDMwNDQzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/5143044319","actor":{"login":"yinyunie","id":25686434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Njg2NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25686434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie","html_url":"https://github.com/yinyunie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinyunie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T15:26:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5143045274,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTE0MzA0NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/5143045274","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-11T15:26:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
