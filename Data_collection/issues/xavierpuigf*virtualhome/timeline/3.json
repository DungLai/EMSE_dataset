This is actually the expected behavior. The scene state changes as you add/remove or change the state of objects, as you will see if you read the graph with `comm.environment_graph()`. If you want to see the changes, you need to call `comm.camera_image(indices)` where indices are the indices of the cameras you want to check.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\nBest,\r\nXavier","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/comments/530106971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2623603400,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjYyMzYwMzQwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xavierpuigf/virtualhome/issues/events/2623603400","actor":{"login":"xavierpuigf","id":4203263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4203263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierpuigf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierpuigf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-10T20:31:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
