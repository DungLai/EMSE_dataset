Usually it is approximated by empirical estimation $$\\sum_{y_i = 1}\\sum_{t_j > t_i} 1(S(t_i|x_j) > S(t_i | x_i))$$. In your code, line 575 in BASE_MODEL.py and line 171 in deephit.py, you use \"roc_auc_score(y_batch, wb)\", which empirically approximate $$P( W(b_j|x_j) > W(b_i|x_i) | y_j = 1, y_i=0)$$, where $$y_i = 1$$ if $$z_i < b_i$$ otherwise $$y_i =0$$. I feel confused about this calculation. Is it equivalent to c-index? I used the notation in your paper here.
