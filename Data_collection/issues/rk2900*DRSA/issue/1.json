Up to this point, I understood the variable 'cost' in BASE_MODEL.py refers L_c in, and the variable 'anlp_node' refers L_z. \r\n\r\nAs explained in the paper (page 4), L_z is a negative log likelihood of true event time z = z^i over the uncensored logs Pr(z \\in V_{l^i}), which is only calculated the 'win' case. \r\n\r\nHere is my question. In the line 312 of BASE_MODEL.py, where you define two variable, is it right to use x[0:market_len+1], x[0:market_len] instead of x[0:bid_len+1], x[0:bid_len]?\r\n \r\n(Line 312) anlp_rate_last_one = tf.reduce_prod(x[0:market_len + 1]) \r\n(Line 313) anlp_rate_last_two = tf.reduce_prod(x[0:market_len]) \r\n(Line 320) log_minus = tf.log(tf.add(tf.transpose(rate_result)[2] - tf.transpose(rate_result)[1], 1e-20))\r\n\r\nI think we should use the difference between x[0:bid_len+1], x[0:bid_len] since 'bid_len' means the true_event time instead of 'market_len' which denotes an observation time, and the difference between two rate_rusult is a dying probability of that time period.  \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nSundong (sundong.kim@kaist.ac.kr)","closed_by":{"login":"Seondong","id":5946793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDY3OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5946793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong","html_url":"https://github.com/Seondong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seondong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rk2900/DRSA/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rk2900/DRSA/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
