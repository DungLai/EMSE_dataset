C-index can be viewed as a weighted sum of time-dependent AuROC. In this sentence, \"If y_i is binary, then ...\", what they mean is that FOR A GIVEN TIME s, every t_i = min(b_i, z_i) will have a binary label: t_i > s or t_i < s. But this \"binary label\" is NOT the censoring status (1 if z_i < b_i; 0 otherwise). In your code, roc_auc_score(y_batch, wb), y_batch is censoring status, if I understand correctly. That's why I feel confused. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rk2900/DRSA/issues/comments/460010848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"weijtang","id":46793148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzkzMTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46793148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang","html_url":"https://github.com/weijtang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijtang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rk2900/DRSA/issues/comments/460013228","html_url":"https://github.com/rk2900/DRSA/issues/3#issuecomment-460013228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rk2900/DRSA/issues/3","id":460013228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDAxMzIyOA==","user":{"login":"rk2900","id":3206646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDY2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3206646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900","html_url":"https://github.com/rk2900","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk2900/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-03T01:00:00Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T01:00:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"In our exp. code, y means t > z_i, which means \"not censored\".\r\nThe two meanings can be inversely exchanged from each other along with the prediction is exchanged as p' = 1-p.\r\nOur label is correct, otherwise the AUC will be less than 0.5 :) which means AUC_{y is censored} = 1 -
