I understand what you mean. It is because the attention function has already been run on line 321 before the start of the loop, so in order to continue using the variable of the attention function, it is necessary to indicate the reuse in i=0. However, since the variable created in the attention function is encapsulated into the function, it is impossible to make reuse=Ture in the scope（named “Attention”） of the function. So you can only explicitly state that all variables under the scope of the previous level (named “attention_decoder”) are reused.\r\nIn other words, when i=0, the variables that indicate the attention function can be reused in the graph. In the following loop, Tensorflow will continue to reuse the variables of the attention function, and there is no need to write reuse=True again（But I think it’s okay to write again）.\r\nAm I correct?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/429517980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CXX1113","id":28216384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjE2Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28216384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113","html_url":"https://github.com/CXX1113","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CXX1113/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/429569080","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/18#issuecomment-429569080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/18","id":429569080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTU2OTA4MA==","user":{"login":"yaserkl","id":6896361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTYzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6896361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-13T19:32:14Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T19:32:14Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"No, don't think of it like encapsulation in python.
