Unfortunately, since training takes a lot of time, we didn't embed the validation part as part of the training and thus you need at least two GPUs to be able to run this code or use a small batch size for the training to be able to fit both the training job and validation job fit into one GPU.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/455751179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yaserkl","id":6896361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTYzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6896361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/456239331","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/25#issuecomment-456239331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/25","id":456239331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjIzOTMzMQ==","user":{"login":"perprit","id":8254214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTQyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8254214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit","html_url":"https://github.com/perprit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-22T01:22:35Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T01:22:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
