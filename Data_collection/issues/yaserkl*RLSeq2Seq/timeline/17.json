The issue has been solve. Thank you for your reply.\r\n\r\nI meet the sample problem that all the decoded results of different examples are the same no matter  I set rl_training=Flase or True, and I have trained the model for about 300000 steps and the loss has stopped failling.\r\n\r\nHow did you solve the issue? This is very important to me and I am looking forward to your reply.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/751552433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DengYangyong","id":47873422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODczNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47873422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong","html_url":"https://github.com/DengYangyong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/751557864","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/17#issuecomment-751557864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/17","id":751557864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTU1Nzg2NA==","user":{"login":"DengYangyong","id":47873422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODczNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47873422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong","html_url":"https://github.com/DengYangyong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-28T03:04:44Z","updated_at":"2020-12-28T03:04:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I meet the sample problem as you when I train the model in chinese dataset.\r\nIn addtion, the loss is too high which was 11 at the beggining and decreased to about 6 after 30K steps.\r\nThere may be same problem with the code as when I use the pytorch version ( https://github.com/rohithreddy024/Text-Summarizer-Pytorch) to train the model , the loss ranged from 6 to 0.8 and the results were good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/751557864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DengYangyong","id":47873422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODczNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47873422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong","html_url":"https://github.com/DengYangyong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DengYangyong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
