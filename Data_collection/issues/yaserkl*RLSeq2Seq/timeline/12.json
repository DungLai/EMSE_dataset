What you end up after deactivating pointer-generator is a simple seq2seq attention based model which is not gonna give you the state-of-the-art results in this specific task. Since this library doesn't have modules for Transformer unit (which currently yields the state-of-the-art results in NMT), I would suggest to try to work on projects like tensor2tensor and add RL training the way that I did in this project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/419236988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yaserkl","id":6896361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTYzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6896361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/419302460","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/12#issuecomment-419302460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/12","id":419302460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTMwMjQ2MA==","user":{"login":"kobenaxie","id":22359441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU5NDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22359441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie","html_url":"https://github.com/kobenaxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kobenaxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-07T02:38:30Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T02:38:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK,
