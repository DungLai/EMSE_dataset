This package is based on Pointer-Generator model. Please not that Paulus et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04304.pdf) is using a completely different set of hyperparameters (check out the section at the very end of the above paper) than the default parameters used in this package. So, if you want to replicate their model, you have to use the same hyperparamters that they used in the paper. We will publish our own trained models (using the default parameter in this package) this coming week.\r\nWe will also provide another model which uses exactly the same set of hyperparameters that Paulus et al. used in their paper in the next few weeks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/418165895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yaserkl","id":6896361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTYzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6896361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaserkl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/comments/418211763","html_url":"https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/11#issuecomment-418211763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/11","id":418211763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODIxMTc2Mw==","user":{"login":"457138317","id":16432315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDMyMzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16432315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317","html_url":"https://github.com/457138317","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/457138317/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T00:55:46Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T00:55:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank
