More specifically, I am looking into applying transfer learning on a legal domain dataset. My current approach is around using transfer learning on a larger, more general dataset in order to pre-train a neural network.\r\n\r\nWith great enthusiasm I read your paper (Deep Transfer Reinforcement Learning for Text Summarization) and I think your approach looks really interesting. The thing I like most is your RL approach to increase the generalization power of the model. In your paper you discuss how you used the RLSeq2Seq framework and build your model on top of it.\r\n\r\nDo you have a protoype of your model and how it can be used? In your work, you refer to the model on www.github.com/yaserkl/TransferRL, but this link seems to be broken.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nickluijtgaarden","id":17782137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgyMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17782137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden","html_url":"https://github.com/nickluijtgaarden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickluijtgaarden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
