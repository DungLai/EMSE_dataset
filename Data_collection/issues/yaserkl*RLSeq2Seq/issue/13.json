I met two problems in data pre-processing stage.\r\n1. It seems that the code missing a import statement in  src/helper/cnn_dm_downloader.py. In line https://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/blob/0095a768b4c2ab65babf87806e7c372d22cde3f0/src/helper/cnn_dm_downloader.py#L42, you use Article class. However, it should be imported from newspaper  module.\r\n\r\n2.  Error in input data? \r\nhttps://github.com/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/blob/0095a768b4c2ab65babf87806e7c372d22cde3f0/src/helper/cnn_dm_downloader.py#L83  , in this line you want the input ended by htmls. However, in your src/helper/README.rst, section Download Raw Data , you said  \r\n\r\n> you need to do is to download the \"*.story\" files for each dataset \r\n\r\nAfter the data download from link, I find it ended with .story, which will not be processed by the code.\r\n\r\n Looking forward to  your replay.
