You did a great job. \r\n\r\nWhat I need to do is to apply the trained model on an article. I used the package and trained a model for 7 days. The result on test set looks fine. But I don't know how to apply the model on new incoming text. I tried to read the downloader and merger code hoping to understand how to get the .bin file. But the downloader code doesn't process any file with \"article\" argument since all I have is \".story\" files. And with the \"highlight\" argument, it created empty folders \"articles\" and \"title\". And with the directory setting, the cnn_dm_data_maker.py file does nothing. So I can't follow these code. \r\n\r\nWhat options do I have to use the trained model on new text?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
