If not, how did you figure out when to stop the training?\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"perprit","id":8254214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTQyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8254214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit","html_url":"https://github.com/perprit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perprit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaserkl/RLSeq2Seq/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
