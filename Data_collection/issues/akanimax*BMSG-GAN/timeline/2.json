Also, in order for WGAN-GP to work, you need to tune the learning rates of the Discriminator and Generator differently.

You get exactly these kinds of colour blocks on the high resolution, but could you please check the output of lower resolutions? MSG-GAN indeed has this advantage over other GANs that you can check the training of lower resolutions as well. So you get highly informative feedback throughout training. Also, just have some patience, because these colour blocks very soon will convert into your required samples.\r\n\r\nFor your reference:\r\nThis is output of my network at highest resolution (256_x_256) at 15th epoch (data is very less 5.5K only):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16590868/55409773-46973400-5580-11e9-9ea5-af38b6a9a0a6.png)\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time, at 8_x_8 the output is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16590868/55409884-7a725980-5580-11e9-9508-1dfa99fe5b20.png)\r\n\r\nBasically, the point is that the training progresses from bottoms up.

If you had mentioned that you have obtained good results using `RaHinge`, I wouldn't have written so. Also, I didn't say that you are impatient :smile:. \r\n\r\nAbout this, I have mentioned in the paper, that With RaHinge or with other Relativistic versions of losses, you don't have to tune the learning rate so much, and that's why we used RaHinge loss. Could you please share your high resolution results with RaHinge? It would be helpful for others as well.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n@akanimax

You get exactly these kinds of colour blocks on the high resolution, but could you please check the output of lower resolutions? MSG-GAN indeed has this advantage over other GANs that you can check the training of lower resolutions as well. So you get highly informative feedback throughout training. Also, just have some patience, because these colour blocks very soon will convert into your required samples.\r\n> \r\n> For your reference:\r\n> This is output of my network at highest resolution (256_x_256) at 15th epoch (data is very less 5.5K only):\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16590868/55409773-46973400-5580-11e9-9ea5-af38b6a9a0a6.png)\r\n> \r\n> And at the same time, at 8_x_8 the output is:\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16590868/55409884-7a725980-5580-11e9-9508-1dfa99fe5b20.png)\r\n> \r\n> Basically, the point is that the training progresses from bottoms up.

What can one expect to see being returned as \"loss\" for both Genenerate and Discriminator networks as the higher resolutions are looking like solid color blocks? I'm assuming that there should be some wavering loss in both networks/functions, but I'm experiencing a rapid drop to ```Loss = 0.0``` for Discriminator, no matter what learning rates I set. Currently testing with the Generator lr = 2 to 5 times the lr of the Discriminator.\r\n\r\nThanks,
