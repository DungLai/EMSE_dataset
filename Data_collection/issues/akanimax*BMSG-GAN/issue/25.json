And In order to match the performance of ProGANs, you increased the size of the Discriminator (the one here in BMSG-GAN is technically half that of ProGAN) and use tricks like Batch Spoofing. So, do you mean that the performance of Pro-GANs is better than BMSG-GAN? But BBMSG-GAN is better than Pro-GANs? Of course, the number of parameters is bigger?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
