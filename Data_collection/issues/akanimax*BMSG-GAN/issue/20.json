Basically I want to modify your architecture slightly to add the functionality of conditioning on image labels. For example if training on the flowers set, rather than just load image data to the model, load both image data + accompanying image label data like image of sunflower and label like tall yellow flower, black seeds in middle etc.\r\n\r\nCan you give me an idea of how to start with this with your code?\r\nMy plan to generate labels is use subfolders in image set where each subfolder name contains images of that name. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nMason","closed_by":{"login":"akanimax","id":16590868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTkwODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16590868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax","html_url":"https://github.com/akanimax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akanimax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
