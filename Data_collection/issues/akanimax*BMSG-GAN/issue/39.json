Why a smaller batch size results  better results? Is there a best batchsize?\r\nBeside,I set batchsize=4, when epoch>70, g-loss went up obviously,and qualities of generated images went worse.Why did this happen? (Training process was interrupted when epoch = 54, I reloaded weight files and optimer states from epoch 53 )\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/39/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
