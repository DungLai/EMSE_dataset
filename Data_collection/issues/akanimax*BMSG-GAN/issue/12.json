I want to train my own data (colour fundus photos) to data augmentation. the number and resolution of  my data set are 235 and 1024*1024. I trained more than 260 epochs, but generated images are still bad and happened the error \"No space left on disk\" , it is that the saved models and samples used too much space of my disk(170G). How can I solve the problems? Thanks a lot.
