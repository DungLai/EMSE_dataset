For example if I have cars in different orientation (facing left, right etc) should I make them all aligned for the GAN training? If I don't, will this hinder the ability to generate images?\r\n\r\nThanks for any insight, \r\nMason","closed_by":{"login":"hbarovertwo","id":29473325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDczMzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29473325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo","html_url":"https://github.com/hbarovertwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbarovertwo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
