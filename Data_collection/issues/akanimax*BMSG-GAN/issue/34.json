I think you paper said the result of showing in paper is trained MSG_ProGAN by using WGAN-GP, and trained MSG_styleGAN by using Non-saturating GAN loss with 1-sided gp.  This repo is for training MSG_ProGAN but default GAN loss is **relativistic-hinge** and then I changed it to wgan-gp it failed ,because of not support for mult-scale Discriminator , Can you update this function code. (B.T.W) I implemented by myself but I don't right or false)\r\n\r\n2. why default using  **relativistic-hinge** not **WGAN-gp**","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akanimax/BMSG-GAN/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
