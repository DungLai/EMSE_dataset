So this repo mainly focuses on using a unified code structure to implement all these models, which may sacrifice some consistency in detail. Usually,  with default parameters, we can get results close to those in papers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/comments/491162208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"songyouwei","id":2573291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2573291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei","html_url":"https://github.com/songyouwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/comments/491164016","html_url":"https://github.com/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/47#issuecomment-491164016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/47","id":491164016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTE2NDAxNg==","user":{"login":"songyouwei","id":2573291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzMyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2573291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei","html_url":"https://github.com/songyouwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songyouwei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T05:44:19Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T05:44:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Because
