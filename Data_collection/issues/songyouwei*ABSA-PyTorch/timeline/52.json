\r\n\r\nI had the same issue. What I did was first get text you want to do sentiment analysis on. For me, it was in a pandas dataframe, with the text in one column and other metadata in another. \r\n\r\nFirst, you need to create a list of words you want to do aspect-based analysis on. These are your keywords. Alternatively, you can extract aspect from the sentence but I digress. \r\n\r\nThen you need to create a loop to go through the data and check in text where you have matches. When you have a match, also take the preceding and succeeding 200 characters (you can use other values, of course). My code looks like this: \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal_text = ''\r\nfor text in df.iloc[:,3]:\r\n    #Replace newline with spaces to not fuck up our output formatting. \r\n    text = text.replace('\\n', ' ')\r\n    #Look for matches in text from list\r\n    matches = [x for x in list_with_keywords if x in text]\r\n    split_list = []\r\n    \r\n    for match in matches:\r\n        #split the list according to the keyword\r\n        split = text.split(match)\r\n        for i in range(len(split)-1):\r\n            #keep the first 200 characters on the left and right of the match. \r\n            # We format as the .xml.seg files in: \r\n            # https://github.com/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/tree/master/datasets/semeval14\r\n            final_text += split[i][-200:] + '$T$' + split[i+1][:200] + '\\n' + match + '\\n\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, just write `final_text` to a text file. You can save it as an .xml.seg file.
