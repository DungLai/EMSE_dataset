I tried running train k-fold cross validation on AEN-BERT, but somehow the variables context=self.bert and target=self.bert in AEN-BERT returns a list of 12 tensors, instead of 1, leading to a type error. I was able to run train.py though, and train_k_fold_cross_val.py works with the other models, just not aen_bert, so I am not sure what to change. Sorry, do you have more advice on how to replicate your results from the paper? Thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/comments/659311803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"momofosho","id":54734022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzM0MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54734022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho","html_url":"https://github.com/momofosho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/momofosho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
