While it's relatively straight forward to reproduce the results using the https://github.com/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/blob/master/train.py script (basically you just need to set `model_name=aen-bert`), I could not figure out how to use the AEN-GloVe version.\r\n\r\nWhich `model_name` did you use to start up the training using the `AEN_Glove` class? https://github.com/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/blob/232fd859cb4b9f2daf36751a66b4cddeb2a03678/models/aen.py#L41\r\n\r\nOr did you train not using `train.py` but another file?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
