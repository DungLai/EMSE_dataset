However, by running a bunch of examples trough the models it seems like the model outputs depends a lot on the examples it has been trained on and kindda overfits.\r\nFor example if I ran the model on:\r\n```\r\n\"sentence\": \"Microsoft is delayed with the Xbox 480\",\r\n\"target\": \"Microsoft\"\r\noutput probs:\r\n[0.11, 0.10, 0.79]\r\n```\r\nwhich is a pretty bad prediction. And if I replace `Microsoft` by another random entity let's say `Koeze` I get the following probs: `0.16, 0.31, 0.53`.\r\n\r\nI went through my training set and it happened that there are a majority of positive samples for both entities. \r\n\r\nDo you have any idea on how I could potentially prevent the model from \"overfitting\" and getting biased?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, \r\nCheers,\r\nJules","closed_by":{"login":"JulesBelveze","id":32683010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjgzMDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32683010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze","html_url":"https://github.com/JulesBelveze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulesBelveze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/songyouwei/ABSA-PyTorch/issues/181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
