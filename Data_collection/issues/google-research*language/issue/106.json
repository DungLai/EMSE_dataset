I'm using building sensor network point names so models pre-trained on standard sentences don't really transfer much useful context, and as the paper identifies it's quite difficult to implement tokenisation so I'd love to be able to use CANINE.\r\n\r\nDo you have a timeline for the release of a pre-training script? I'm assuming I could use that to generate weights and then load into the Huggingface implementation. Ideally, I'd also disable the next sentence prediction - I'm training on records not sentences, the difference being there's no natural order so NSP doesn't really apply (although I could potentially substitute with records from the same system)","closed_by":{"login":"david-waterworth","id":5028974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth","html_url":"https://github.com/david-waterworth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/language/issues/106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/language/issues/106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
