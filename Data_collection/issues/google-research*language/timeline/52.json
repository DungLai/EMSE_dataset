From your graph, it is clear that the training loss reduces during the warmup phase of training, but then the learning rate is too high and a bad gradient (from a small batch) can put off the optimization. You could also simply try smaller learning rates, maybe 1e-5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/language/issues/comments/606309476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"martiansideofthemoon","id":8805240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDUyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8805240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon","html_url":"https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiansideofthemoon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/language/issues/comments/606314405","html_url":"https://github.com/google-research/language/issues/52#issuecomment-606314405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google-research/language/issues/52","id":606314405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjMxNDQwNQ==","user":{"login":"ahmadrash","id":2061178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjExNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2061178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmadrash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadrash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-30T23:59:07Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T23:59:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot for the suggestions.
