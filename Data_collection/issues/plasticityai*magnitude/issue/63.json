We will eventually get to responding to some of the issues and adding new features when we are able to, but if you use this project day-to-day for your own use and have time to help maintain it, we would appreciate it. It would almost certainly be better than rolling your own solution at this point and would benefit the community of users who use this package. :) We also already have a good CI/CD infrastructure setup for it, so releasing new versions and adding tests should be easy.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is not the correct repository to send Pull Requests to. This GitHub repository is a mirror of the GitLab repository, [see here for more information](https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude#contributing). This is another reason why we cannot just easily merge GitHub PRs here.
