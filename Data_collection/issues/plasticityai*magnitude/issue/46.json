For example, with other embeddings (e.g., word2vec, paragram-sl999), you'll at least get positive traits on one side and negative traits on the other. I don't see much rhyme or reason in the above plot.\r\n\r\nI get better results if I get vectors for the above traits by putting each of them in a 'sentence' with the word 'trait'. And I also get decent results if I use Allen NLP's elmo implementation even when *not* contextualizing the trait words.\r\n\r\nI've also tried regressing human judgments about masculinity and femininity directly on the embeddings, and I get pretty much random predictions, whereas using other vectors (again, word2vec, paragram) or the getting ELMO vectors contextualized by the word 'trait' predicts the human judgments pretty well.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
