I am trying to install the `pymagnitude` package, using the command `pip3 install pymagnitude`, but it get's stuck after downloading and doesn't proceed to install. I supplied the verbose flag with the command to see what it's getting stuck at and turn's out, it's getting stuck at:\r\n```\r\nRunning setup.py (path:/tmp/pip-build-60o8i7g_/pymagnitude/setup.py) egg_info for package pymagnitude\r\nRunning command python setup.py egg_info\r\n```\r\nI tried installing it in a fresh virtual environment just to ensure that it was not the fault of my environment, but it did not work there too. Is it actually getting stuck or am I just being impatient and the package take 5+ minutes to install?\r\n\r\nFor your reference, I am running Python 3.6.5 on an Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.
