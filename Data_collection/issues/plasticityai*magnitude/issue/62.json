The title sums up my reaction when I tried to install the latest version of magnitude. (I've been using version 0.1.13 for a while now)\r\n\r\nI work in a corporate environment with an internal pypi proxy and some somewhat stringent checks on packages and stuff. All our packages and dependencies are scanned for license issues, and known code smells/bugs as well as against a list of known CVE.\r\nI tried installing the latest version of magnitude and after downloading the wheel it just hanged. After a few failed attempts I tried to download the archive and install it manually and I started seeing all these calls to aws and pypi which of course would fail since I'm cutoff from the internet.\r\n\r\nI know that my issue isn't yours, but ... not cool guys, setup.py has its semantics and hijacking it like that ... well suffice to say I will probably have a call asking about all these connection attempts to blacklisted urls.\r\n\r\nAnyway, not sure what can be done about it, as I didn't spend the time to understand everything that was going on but I still wanted to let you know that you are breaking at least this lone developer's project by doing so. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"aborsu","id":5033617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5033617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu","html_url":"https://github.com/aborsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aborsu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
