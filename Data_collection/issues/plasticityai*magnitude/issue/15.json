Maybe there should be some feature where if OOV querying is taking too long, a random vector, like for the light model, is returned?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/15/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
