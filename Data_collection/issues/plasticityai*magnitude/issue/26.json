seems like during the v1.3.5 release when you moved the installation files it broke pip installing\r\n\r\nI've tried both in a docker container running debian jessie as well as on my mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n```\r\n# Breaks\r\npip install pymagnitude\r\npip install pymagnitude==0.1.35\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# This works\r\npip install pymagnitude==0.1.34\r\n```\r\n\r\nError:\r\n```\r\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: pymagnitude\r\n  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for pymagnitude ... done\r\n  Stored in directory: /Users/mycoolusername/Library/Caches/pip/wheels/d3/b0/69/5c2868a48835e8e79c2580c641548e8fdf953bfc29df4a\r\nSuccessfully built pymagnitude\r\nCould not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy-1.15.0.dist-info/METADATA'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the problem is with the python package file move, the solution would most likely to be to move it back to where it was originally or edit the package config file (I forget).\r\n\r\nThank you for making such an awesome project.","closed_by":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
