Here's an exerpt from a minimal session using one of the pretrained fasttext .vec files\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [3]: Magnitude(\"wiki-news-300d-1M.vec\")\r\nDatabaseError                             Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-3-d79f82a84c59> in <module>()\r\n----> 1 Magnitude(\"wiki-news-300d-1M.vec\")\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pymagnitude/__init__.py in __init__(self, path, lazy_loading, blocking, use_numpy, case_insensitive, pad_to_length, truncate_left, pad_left, placeholders, ngram_oov, supress_warnings, batch_size, eager, dtype, _namespace, _number_of_values)\r\n    195         # Get metadata about the vectors\r\n    196         self.length = self._db().execute(\r\n--> 197             \"SELECT COUNT(key) FROM magnitude\") \\\r\n    198             .fetchall()[0][0]\r\n    199         self.original_length = self._db().execute(\r\n\r\nDatabaseError: file is not a database\r\n```\r\nPopping into the debugger, `self.path` points to the temporary .magnitude file, and instantiating a `Magnitude` object directly from there works just fine.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nipdb> p self.path\r\n'/var/folders/vc/70hjbvsd3pq85t7x693365rc0000gn/T/c620a226ebc2c24c12ee1be5127d1448.magnitude'\r\nipdb> Magnitude(self.path)\r\n<pymagnitude.Magnitude object at 0x10f2dea58>\r\n```\r\nSo I modified the definition of `self._db` in `__init__.py` to just use \r\n\r\n```python\r\nconn = sqlite3.connect(self.path,\r\n          check_same_thread=False)\r\n```\r\nirrespective of the OS, and that seemed to solve the problem. There's likely a better way of doing things though.
