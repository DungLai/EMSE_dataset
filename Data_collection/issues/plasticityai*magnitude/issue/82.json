The model is built from native Word2Vec format with 50 dimensions and 50 trees. The magnitude model is close to 350MB, with approximately 350000 tokens.\r\nLoad testing this API I observed that the performance deteriorates as I increase the topn value for most_similar_approx, I need a high number of similar tokens for downstream activities, \r\nwith topn=150 I get a throughput of 500 transactions per second on the API,\r\nwhile gradually reducing it I get 800 transactions with topn=50 and and ~1300 with topn=10.\r\nThe server instance is not under any memory/cpu load, am using a c5.xlarge AWS EC2 instance.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway I can tune the model to improve the performance for a high topn value?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
