I mount the magnitude file as a volume on the container but I believe that the cache is written to a temp dir inside the container.  Is it possible to configure where the cache is written to?  I would like to write the to the same volume mounted to the container  so that the next container that starts up can use it as well.\r\n\r\nWhen I develop locally I see that the first load of the magnitude file take s ~120s with the options `lazy_loading=-1` and `blocking=True`.  I am using these options so that my API does not start serving requests until pymagnitude can have consistent response times when running `most_similar()`.  The next time I start the API I see that pymagnitude locally only takes ~300ms load.  However, when I run the api in a docker container the load time is consistently ~120s.  I am assuming the this is because the cache is written to a temp dir.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude/blob/master/pymagnitude/__init__.py#L375-L378\r\n\r\nI also maybe completely misunderstanding why sometimes it loads faster locally.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"TNorden","id":805182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/805182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden","html_url":"https://github.com/TNorden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TNorden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
