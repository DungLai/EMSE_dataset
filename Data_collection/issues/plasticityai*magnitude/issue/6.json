First of all thanks for your effort. This is a pretty impressive library.\r\n\r\nI'm not very experienced on nlp but I'm currently working on a sort of nlp task which involves classifying some text messages without having labeled data. Project I'm working on needs to process Turkish sentences. Can I somehow use this library to train on Turkish documents? If so can you provide me an example or guide me on the process?
