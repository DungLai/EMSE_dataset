I just tested it in a fresh docker container ('python:latest' which uses Python 3.6.5 and pip 18.0. I created a virtualenv, activated it, and installed it and it seemed to work fine. \r\n\r\nThis might be an issue with your particular environment. The installation does require compiling some native code for its dependencies which might be where things are going wrong. As a note, we try to avoid this whenever possible. When I built the installation, I created eggs (which contain pre-compiled objects for all of the native code) for all the major platforms (32/64-bit macOS, Linux, and 64-bit Windows) for `pymagnitude`. Unfortunately, Python eggs don't recursively pre-compile dependencies of the main project (like `lz4`) that have native code. So I also created a custom install step that creates eggs for all the dependencies so that no compiler would be necessary on all the major platforms.\r\n\r\nWhen any egg installation fails or you are not on a major platform (32/64-bit macOS, Linux, and 64-bit Windows), it falls back to trying to compile the dependencies on your local computer using whatever C/C++ compiler you have. If you don't have a C/C++ compiler available on your machine it can cause issues.\r\n\r\nThe following information would be helpful to debug:\r\n\r\n**OS:** ??\r\n**OS Version:** ??\r\n**CPU:** (Intel or ARM? 32-bit or 64-bit?)\r\n\r\nAnd please re-run the installation in a new, fresh virtualenv with the command `pip3 install pymagnitude -vvvv` and paste the resulting log.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/410881427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1774042279,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxNzc0MDQyMjc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1774042279","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-06T23:14:12Z","assignee":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1774042723,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3NzQwNDI3MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1774042723","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-06T23:14:37Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1774042726,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3NzQwNDI3MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1774042726","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gi
