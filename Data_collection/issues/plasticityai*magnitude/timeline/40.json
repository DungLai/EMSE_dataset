Install normally. This does actually install with binary wheels (if your system is supported Mac, Linux, some Windows). It doesn't download the wheel from PyPI, however, as I made the install script download it from our S3 bucket for reasons. However, it should be coming from `us-east-1` Amazon S3 which is quite far from China, but still shouldn't be that big of a problem IMO (let me know if that is an issue, maybe I can set up a CDN). I actually bundle all of the recursive dependencies (`numpy`, `torch`) as binary wheels as well, to prevent C compilation issues during install. So the binary wheel actually gets quite large (~120-300MB). The download is a little slow for 120-300MB, but the installation is pretty much instant since there is nothing to build. Here in the USA 120MB downloads pretty quickly even at most residential internet speeds.\r\n\r\n2. Build from source (`SKIP_MAGNITUDE_WHEEL`). You can build from source by passing this flag. If a wheel for your system is not supported, it will build from source. This can be slow. It has to compile 2 versions of SQLite, and if your system doesn't have `numpy` or `torch` it may compile those as well.\r\n\r\nCould you answer some questions to help debug:\r\n1. Do you have this problem with other packages as well? I'm not very familiar with the internet situation in China, but is there throttling of US websites / is the overall internet speed low? \r\n2. Would downloading 120-300MB from Amazon S3 take a long time?\r\n3. Why do you need to install Magnitude over and over again? Are you installing it on a production server? Are you installing inside a Docker image?

unfortunate. It seems like Aliyun (Alibaba Cloud) might be timing out HTTPS SSL connections to Amazon S3.

Sometimes both in Aliyun and AWS China, I only got less than 50KB/s download speed. Sometimes 2MB/s+. No pattern founded. Just really not stable. Poor network between China and US.\r\n2. Using CDN is great, and add a parameter for load an offline `pymagnitude-0.1.120-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl` is also good enough.\r\nThank you for your time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/442802775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gladuo","id":5893628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTM2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5893628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo","html_url":"https://github.com/gladuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gladuo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1994982544,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk5NDk4MjU0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1994982544","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-29T11:38:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1994982546,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5OTQ5ODI1NDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1994982546","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-29T11:38:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2732835496,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjczMjgzNTQ5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/2732835496","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-22T11:00:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/592422180","html_url":"https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/40#issuecomment-592422180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/40","id":592422180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3Vl

1. Got it, that makes sense. Since we are using our S3 server for the wheel download, it might not be taking advantage of the PyPI China mirrors.\r\n> 2. Try downloading this: https://s3.amazonaws.com/magnitude.plasticity.ai/wheelhouse/pymagnitude-0.1.119-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl (Python 3.6 Linux x86_64 Binary Wheel Magnitude Version: 0.1.119) and tell me if that is slow and how long it takes.
