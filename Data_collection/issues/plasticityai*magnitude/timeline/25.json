for the suggestion. Since the input file is malformed and this is not a bug with the library, I won't be fixing this. It adds unnecessary complexity to the code for ignoring places where errors are found and could lead to cases where it makes real bugs harder to find if the code just skips malformed inputs. A better warning message would be nice though, which I'll try to add in the future.\r\n\r\nSince the converter is really only meant for people who have created their own models (since we pre-convert all popular models), I assume those are sufficiently advanced users such that they could figure out how to build the format file correctly or clean malformed files. I am more open to handling malformed / bad inputs in the actual main library. \r\n\r\nFWIW, I'm sure there's some mix of a `grep`/`awk`/`sed` pipeline in `bash` that could clean your malformed file by counting the number of spaces on each line and filtering lines that don't match the right criteria.
