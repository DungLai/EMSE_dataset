sorry this library is meant to be a utility focused on speed, efficiency, and robustness for loading embeddings only, not training. Training is an entirely different beast and there are plenty of tools out there that let you do it fairly easily. Moreover, methods for training embeddings vary widely and it would be nearly impossible to add all of them to this this library and it would bloat the package. I'd consider it in the future if one method dominated and everyone was using it to train embeddings but for now it seems as though there are many competing implementations for training embeddings.

You have a dummy embedding layer in Keras. Say that you are doing skip-gram training, with window size 3, and negative sampling rate 16. So that dummy embedding variable has a size of embedding_dim*(1 + 3*2 + 16). \r\n\r\nWe get our target, context, and negative samples vectors from the Magnitude object, and copy those values to the Keras embedding, then perform the forward step. \r\n\r\nAfter the backwards pass, we copy the updated keras embedding values to the vectors in the Magnitude object. \r\n\r\nThen before we next forward pass, we get new values for the target, context, and negative samples, and copy those to the keras embedding layer. \r\n\r\nThis was a bit tricky to explain, so let me know if some parts were confusing to understand. \r\n\r\nOne major drawback is that we won't be able to use any optimizers with parameter-specific momentum, like Adagrad/Adam. But as far as I know this is the only vector library where the vectors are stored to disk (if not, please let me know!).\r\n\r\nIf copy values to keras is surprisingly difficult, then it definitely should be easy with a pure numpy training implementation. \r\n\r\nSo all we need to do is to be able to update the individual vectors in the magnitude object. From looking at the code, I don't see a way to do that. But I think it shouldn't be too tricky since it's just a sqlite database.
