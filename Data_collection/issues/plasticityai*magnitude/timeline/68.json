Function spatial.distance.cosine will calculate the distance between two vectors for you, and you just need let 1 - the distance to be the similarity.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n```\r\nfrom scipy import spatial\r\n\r\nvec_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\nvec_2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\r\nsimilarity = 1 - spatial.distance.cosine(vec_1, vec_2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in package spatial.distance, there are a lot of other distance calculating functions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/570105302/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SakigamiYang","id":15279135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjc5MTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15279135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang","html_url":"https://github.com/SakigamiYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SakigamiYang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/616688140","html_url":"https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/68#issuecomment-616688140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/68","id":616688140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjY4ODE0MA==","user":{"login":"alexsands","id":4269772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjk3NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands","html_url":"https://github.com/alexsands","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexsands/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-20T17:06:19Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T17:06:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If you're looking for the similarity between keys, you can use:\r\n```python\r\nvectors.similarity(\"cat\", \"dog\")  #
