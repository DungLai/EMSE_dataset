The reason why is because we compile the wheels for sub-dependencies (like `numpy`) as well and bundle them all up. Normally, `setup.py` doesn't let you do this. We do this because with all of the different environments, operating systems, C/C++ toolchains people have installed, installation often fails due to a sub-dependency compilation error. So we decided to pre-compile everything for Windows, Linux, and Mac. This has worked great for most users.\r\n\r\nDon't think we will reverse this, but we do have a way to install without using anything pre-compiled:\r\n\r\n ```bash\r\nSKIP_MAGNITUDE_WHEEL=1 pip3 install pymagnitude -vvvv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should force it to compile everything on your system, without downloading any pre-compiled wheels. Alternatively, you can always just clone the source repository and manually install the sub-dependencies as peer dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/544691902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/544807911","html_url":"https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/62#issuecomment-544807911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/62","id":544807911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDgwNzkxMQ==","user":{"login":"ParikhKadam","id":39589393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTg5Mzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39589393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam","html_url":"https://github.com/ParikhKadam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParikhKadam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T05:15:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T05:15:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey @AjayP13 ..
