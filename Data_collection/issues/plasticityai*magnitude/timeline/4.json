This seems to work on Mac and Linux. \r\n\r\nIt seems like `fastener` only supports Mac and Linux with `fcntl`. However, there is a way to implement InterProcess file locking with [`msvcrt` on Windows](http://darkeside.blogspot.com/2010/11/python-msvcrtlocking-trials-and.html). \r\n\r\nIf I gave you contributor access on the main [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/Plasticity/magnitude), would you be comfortable creating a branch that fixes this issue and Issue #2 by checking `if WINDOWS: # do windows specific code`? That would be greatly appreciated as I don't have a Windows computer to test this
