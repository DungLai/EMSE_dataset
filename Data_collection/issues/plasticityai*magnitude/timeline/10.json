Magnitude's settings are out-of-the-box configured to make local developing and iterating on models using word vectors *reasonably fast* as well as *approach in-memory speed* for production server deployment. The time trade-off made is we get rid of initial load times to make iterating much faster by making initial queries a little slower, but for many repeated queries we want Magnitude to approach Gensim so it can still be used in production. \r\n\r\nThis means on benchmarks that don't simulate repeated lookups it may appear slow because those benchmarks don't fully utilize the cache that would be available an average production scenario. Moreover, there are background threads run when Magnitude boots up that begin eagerly pre-fetching data into caches. This is useful for production environments to pre-fetch data into the cache in the background, but will also negatively impact a benchmark score.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nMagnitude ultimately works by using a SQLite index for looking up a token and getting the vector. It lets SQLite and the OS manage caching data into memory which should be quite optimized. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is one additional layer of caching introduced by Magnitude where `query` calls are LRU-cached (the size of the LRU can be configured with the `lazy_loading` constructor argument and is by default unbounded). What this means is that, over time, Magnitude will get faster as the same words are looked up over and over again. We found this to work really well *practically* due to [Zipf's Law](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law). Even though the first look up of the word \"the\" might be a little slow compared to Gensim's mmap method, it is negligible, since over time the look up for the word \"the\" will be fast since it will hit the in-memory LRU cache.\r\n\r\n## Different configurations of Magnitude\r\n\r\nHere's a few things you can try:\r\n\r\n1. Turn off background threads eagerly loading the LRU caches:\r\n```python\r\nvectors = Magnitude('/path/to/w2v.magnitude', eager=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Turn on blocking (this will turn off lazy-loading and require you to wait a little bit before you can perform queries, but make the queries faster):\r\n```python\r\nvectors = Magnitude('/path/to/w2v.magnitude', blocking=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Use the raw vectors NumPy mmap:\r\n```python\r\nvectors.get_vectors_mmap()\r\n```\r\nThis requires knowing the index of the word you want to lookup (you may need a separate data structure to do this). It is also takes sometime to build this mmap, so you will have to wait. However, it is cached even between different runs of Python on your computer/server's `/tmp/` directory. So you only have to wait *once*.\r\n\r\n## Recommendation\r\nOverall, I suspect if you want to / need to eke out every bit of performance in your application, there possibly are faster ways to do so than what we use in Magnitude, but we try to make Magnitude the simplest way to make development and production use of word vectors reasonably fast without having to one configuration/library for development and another configuration/library for production. We also add a ton of the nice to have features like misspelling lookups, OOV lookups, approximate lookups, multi-threading support etc. Would really depend on your application whether it makes sense to trade these off or not.\r\n\r\nIf you have any ways of making Magnitude faster that you find from your usage, that doesn't affect its current performance, feel free to submit a PR!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/comments/390321049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1635078024,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxNjM1MDc4MDI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1635078024","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-18T20:20:44Z","assignee":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1635078405,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MzUwNzg0MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1635078405","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-18T20:20:58Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1635078622,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MzUwNzg2MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plasticityai/magnitude/issues/events/1635078622","actor":{"login":"AjayP13","id":5404177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDQxNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5404177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13","html_url":"https://github.com/AjayP13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjayP13/following{/other_us
