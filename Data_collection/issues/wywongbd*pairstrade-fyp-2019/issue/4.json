I was wondering if you can help me a little bit. \r\n\r\nSo I have gotten to the point where I have created and saved the model (trading model without commission file). I am using my own price data (Compustat WRDS). \r\n\r\nWhat is the next steps for me to evaluate the strategies, in the jupyter_py folder there is nothing distinctly related to reinforcement learning correct? In the 8b-Generate-Baseline-Plots.ipynb folder I can see the following as input, \"final_report_outputs/test_energy_1.txt\" but I donâ€™t know how to first of all how to generate the data and that .txt file, what python code should I run? Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you can metion the steps I have to follow. \r\n\r\nTo show you to what point I have progressed to feel free to see my Colab file https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QknCC_rfTm8eqa3-oo3bK3GXCTEOLIOH\r\n\r\nBest regards, and good work,\r\nDerek Snow","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wywongbd/pairstrade-fyp-2019/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wywongbd/pairstrade-fyp-2019/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
