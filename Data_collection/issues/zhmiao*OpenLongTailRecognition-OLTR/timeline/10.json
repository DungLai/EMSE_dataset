At the same time, since we are also trying to use distance as the scoring metric for open class detection. If we force the samples of each class to be more compact to their corresponding centroids, during testing, with the help of reachability, it is more likely that samples of open class can have larger distances to centroids compared to samples of known classes.

you?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/505717114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhmiao","id":7812475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7812475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2439612648,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQzOTYxMjY0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2439612648","actor":{"login":"valencebond","id":44313446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzEzNDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44313446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond","html_url":"https://github.com/valencebond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-26T04:50:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2439612649,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0Mzk2MTI2NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2439612649","actor":{"login":"valencebond","id":44313446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzEzNDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44313446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond","html_url":"https://github.com/valencebond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valencebond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-26T04:50:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2439612774,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI0Mzk2MTI3NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2439612774","actor":{"login":"zhmiao","id":7812475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7812475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-26T04:51:03Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/505740354","html_url":"https://gith
