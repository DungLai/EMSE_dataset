Actually we have obtained some similar observations in our follow-up project. \r\n\r\nA model trained on long-tailed dataset has some interesting behavior change with different initializations and epoches:\r\n1. Large learning rate tends to make the model bias to many-shot classes;\r\n2. Intermediate and late epoches are critical for the performance of few-shot classes. \r\n\r\nWe speculate the root of these phenomena come from the learning dynamics of long-tail-trained models. Therefore, we are considering update our manuscript to report a sequence of snapshot accuracies instead of a single final accuracy. It is yet an open question, and we believe it is definitely an interesting direction to further investigate.\r\n\r\nOur aim of the open long-tailed recognition paper is to formally define and make clear this important real-world problem, instead of providing a silver-bullet solution.
