We are very sorry that we made mistakes in the paper. Actually, for Place, the alpha should be 1.34 and the actual count is 62K. 184K is the number of data generated with alpha=6. We switched to a more extremely long-tailed distribution right before submission. This might be the reason we forgot to change these numbers. \r\n\r\nOne the other hand, the reason why the distribution in the log-log space is not strict linear is that first, we use numpy to generate random numbers, second, during data generation, the actual min number of the data is 25. then for each class, we take 20 samples to construct the validation set. This process will also affect the log-log distribution. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/528978983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhmiao","id":7812475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7812475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2615339361,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxNTMzOTM2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2615339361","actor":{"login":"ssfootball04","id":24720774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzIwNzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24720774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04","html_url":"https://github.com/ssfootball04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T19:11:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2615339362,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTUzMzkzNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2615339362","actor":{"login":"ssfootball04","id":24720774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzIwNzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24720774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04","html_url":"https://github.com/ssfootball04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T19:11:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/529150153","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/38#issuecomment-529150153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/38","id":529150153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTE1MDE1Mw==","user":{"login":"ssfootball04","id":24720774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzIwNzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24720774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04","html_url":"https://github.com/ssfootball04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssfootball04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"c
