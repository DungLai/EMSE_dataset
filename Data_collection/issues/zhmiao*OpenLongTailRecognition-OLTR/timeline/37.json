@Lilyo , thank you very much for asking. Yes, I agree this metric is a little bit confusing. The reason why the authors treat images from the open set that are incorrectly classified as known samples as false negative is because this whole setting is fundamentally an open set detection problem. We need to identify open set samples at the same time be correct for the closed set classification. When considering both aspects, the authors designed this specific metric. This definitely is not a perfect metric, and we think it is still an open problem that needs improvement from all different directions. Does that make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/528969167/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhmiao","id":7812475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7812475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2615267429,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxNTI2NzQyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2615267429","actor":{"login":"Lilyo","id":12732228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMyMjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12732228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo","html_url":"https://github.com/Lilyo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T18:42:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2615267432,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTUyNjc0MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2615267432","actor":{"login":"Lilyo","id":12732228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMyMjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12732228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo","html_url":"https://github.com/Lilyo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T18:42:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/529287021","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/37#issuecomment-529287021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/37","id":529287021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTI4NzAyMQ==","user":{"login":"Lilyo","id":12732228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMyMjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12732228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo","html_url":"https://github.com/Lilyo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lilyo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T03:33:40Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T03:33:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes,
