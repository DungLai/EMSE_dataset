@RamyaRaghuraman Actually, as written in the paper, we used frozen resnet 152 feature extractor for the places experiments. The first reason is that finetuning resnet 152 requires large gpu resource, which we don't have. Second, as I explained in https://github.com/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/22#issuecomment-516685058 self attention module and meta embedding module require initialization. Since the feature extractor is already imagenet pretrained, so self attention module won't be affected too much. However, in stage 1, we are still training classifier module with an additional fc layer. The memory is initialized using the feature after the fc, and the meta embedding was initialized using the stage 1 pretrained classifier. So the training of stage 1 is not meaningless.

aRaghuraman Thanks for posting the error message. It seems to be a problem of running pytorch on windows instead of frozen weights. Here is an issue from pytorch official repo: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/5858#issue-306187894 . I will close this issue and open a new one about this (https://github.com/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/29#issue-478007805). We do not have a windows machine to test it for now. I think we will try to get one and see if it is possible to reproduce.

The first reason is that finetuning resnet 152 requires large gpu resource, which we don't have. Second, as I explained in [#22 (comment)](https://github.com/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/22#issuecomment-516685058) self attention module and meta embedding module require initialization. Since the feature extractor is already imagenet pretrained, so self attention module won't be affected too much. However, in stage 1, we are still training classifier module with an additional fc layer. The memory is initialized using the feature after the fc, and the meta embedding was initialized using the stage 1 pretrained classifier. So the training of stage 1 is not meaningless.\r\n\r\nHi, I don't agree this explain. In my understanding, the dimension of centroid is num_class*num_feature, however, the output of fc is a 1*num_class vector, their size are not matched, how can a vector initialize a matrix？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/529865954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jchhuang","id":16332360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMyMzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16332360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/jchhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2621666406,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYyMTY2NjQwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2621666406","actor":{"login":"jchhuang","id":16332360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMyMzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16332360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/jchhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-10T10:03:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2621666407,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MjE2NjY0MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2621666407","actor":{"login":"jchhuang","id":16332360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMyMzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16332360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/jchhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchhuang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-10T10:03:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2621666410,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYyMTY2NjQxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2621666410","actor":{"login":"RamyaRaghuraman","id":36335371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzM1Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36335371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman","html_url":"https://github.com/RamyaRaghuraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamyaRaghuraman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-10T10:03:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2621666411,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MjE2NjY0MTE=","url":"https://api.github.
