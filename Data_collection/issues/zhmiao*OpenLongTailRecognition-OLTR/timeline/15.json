OK， I get what you are saying. Actually the spatial attention is just the feature map of that conv layer, we did not do anything special, we just call the feature map spatial attention. In the code, it is much more straightforward. The reason we call it spatial attention is because the feature map basically is a kind of attention spatially in the input image.
