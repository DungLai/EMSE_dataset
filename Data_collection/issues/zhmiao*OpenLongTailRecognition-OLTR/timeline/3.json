Then in the beginning of the second stage, we use these centers to initialize the `self.criterions['FeatureLoss'].centroids.data`, and from https://github.com/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/blob/master/run_networks.py#L98 , we initialize an optimizer for the criterion. During training, in the `self.batch_backward()` function (https://github.com/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/blob/master/run_networks.py#L139), the criterion optimizer is stepped, and this is where the centroids are updated according to the losses, because centroids are updateable parameters of the feature criterion in stage 2. Does this make sense to you?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/493204817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhmiao","id":7812475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7812475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2347499502,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0NzQ5OTUwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2347499502","actor":{"login":"emma-sjwang","id":16148104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ4MTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16148104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang","html_url":"https://github.com/emma-sjwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T19:40:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2347499503,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDc0OTk1MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2347499503","actor":{"login":"emma-sjwang","id":16148104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ4MTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16148104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang","html_url":"https://github.com/emma-sjwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emma-sjwang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T19:40:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2347513790,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzNDc1MTM3OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/events/2347513790","actor":{"login":"zhmiao","id":7812475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7812475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T19:46:23Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/comments/493342934","html_url":"http
