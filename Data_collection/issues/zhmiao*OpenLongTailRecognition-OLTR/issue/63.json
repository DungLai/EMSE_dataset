Why the input dimension of the `fc_spatial` layer in `ModulatedAttLayer` is 7*7*in_channel? Why it is 7?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the dimension should equal the dimension of the input image, e.g. C*H*W in an image, then the input dimension of the `fc_spatial` layer should be H*W*C, right?\r\n\r\nThank you for your advice!","closed_by":{"login":"lixucuhk","id":44832757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODMyNzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44832757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk","html_url":"https://github.com/lixucuhk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixucuhk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
