I am puzzled by the following issues, which I'm hoping you can help me with :\r\n-> Places-LT has 62.5K examples, differently from the reported 184.5K images in the paper. Is the mistake in the paper or in the released dataset ?\r\n-> I am unable to reproduce the dataset statistics for ImageNet-LT and Places-LT using Zipf's law (  discrete Pareto distribution : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law ) with alpha=6 ( which seems rather high ). Moreover, the log-log plot is not completely linear in my opinion :\r\n![ImageNet-LT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24720774/64450221-f2215300-d0e1-11e9-87b4-c9b105d0e069.png)\r\n![Places-LT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24720774/64450222-f2215300-d0e1-11e9-816d-2993652093f1.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zhmiao","id":7812475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7812475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao","html_url":"https://github.com/zhmiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhmiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhmiao/OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
