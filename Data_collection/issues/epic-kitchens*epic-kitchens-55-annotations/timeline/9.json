\r\nThanks for this great dataset.\r\n\r\nI find your pretrained model provided in https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/gw5q146a9dqd2t82jhu8noe3m with 290 classes. But I can not figure out how to convert the id in class map of this pretrained model to category_id. \r\n\r\nE.g. bag with id 19 in class map of pretrained model but it has id 20 in EPIC_noun_classes.csv. When submitting to the test server, what should be the category_id of the bag? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
