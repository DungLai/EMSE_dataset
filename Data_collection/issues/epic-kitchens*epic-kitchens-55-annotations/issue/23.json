So I am confused about what collection of categories would be evaluated.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in the dataset. Your model should detect all **clustered** noun classes which appear in the training set (of which there are 295). You can find the noun classes for each bounding box in the `noun_class` column of the `EPIC_train_object_labels.csv`. The class label and names of objects contained in each class can be found in `EPIC_noun_classes.csv`.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @hazeld in https://github.com/epic-kitchens/annotations/issues/14#issuecomment-513697964_","closed_by":{"login":"youthHan","id":18671115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjcxMTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18671115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan","html_url":"https://github.com/youthHan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youthHan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
