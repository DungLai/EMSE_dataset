Thank you for creating and maintaining a great project! \r\nIn my case I am working with a subset ,i.e., some of the kitchens, of the epic-kitchens-55 dataset. I think I need ground truth test action labels, since I am not using the entire dataset to perform my experiments. Basically, I want to calculate accuracy on the actions from certain kitchens and not the whole dataset, so I guess the epic-55 leaderboard option will not do. How can I get the the test accuracy in my case using a subset of the published test data?","closed_by":{"login":"dimadamen","id":9195098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxOTUwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9195098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen","html_url":"https://github.com/dimadamen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimadamen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
