The service takes the branch and rev and downloads the raw diff from `hg.mozilla.org`.\r\n\r\nWe can use the same service to choose which tests to run locally (via `mach test`) as well. All we would need is an endpoint that allows the user to directly POST the diff(s) that they wish to process. We could call it `diff/schedules`. Maybe `schedules` is the wrong verb in this context and something like `selects` would be better.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
