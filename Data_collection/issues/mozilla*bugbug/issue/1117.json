might be preferable to choose a single platform (e.g. linux64-opt) and run all suites only on that platform, to avoid making separate builds.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that right now the model is trained using whole jobs (platform + suite chunk), because the historical data we have contains whole jobs, and there's no 1:1 mapping between suite chunk on a platform and suite chunk on another platform (chunking can be different).","closed_by":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
