While this is expected, I think it might be getting worse, as the issues data is unbalanced and has much more data points for `needsdiagnosis = False`. We've started a discussion in https://github.com/mozilla/webcompat-team-okrs/issues/256 \r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that in the [recent sample of 22 issues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F9vcSpLQ_hNBeZinsytGXlfXpJLW6vh7C0BJYtd9hIY/edit?pli=1#gid=1640243023) most of the issues that looked like false negatives didn't end up needing diagnosis (not reproducible,  out of the scope of the project, etc.), so they're true negatives (prediction was correct for 21 of them). We'll continue tracking them to get a more representative sample.\r\n\r\nAs an example, issues that looked like they need diagnosis, but in the end, they didn't (prediction was correct):\r\nhttps://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/100746\r\nhttps://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/100676\r\nhttps://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/100687\r\n\r\nIssues that are false negatives (prediction was incorrect): \r\nhttps://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/100495\r\nhttps://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/100645\r\n\r\nI was thinking of including an additional set of issues that will contribute to `needsdiagnosis = True` pool. We have recently added a `moved` [milestone](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Amoved+is%3Aclosed). These issues often don't need diagnosis and are moved to bugzilla or elsewhere, but their content should be contributed to `needsdiagnosis = True`  rather than false. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
