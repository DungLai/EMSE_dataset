Maybe a number of thread limit?\r\nThe bugbug repository mining code is single threaded when run in the HTTP service, the only thing that runs multiple threads is the rust-code-analysis server (and it uses num_cpus threads).\r\n\r\nMaybe the Heroku instance we are using has a lot of CPUs and so the rust-code-analysis server spawns a lot of threads? Why have we never seen it so far though? Maybe we were unlucky and we were moved to a different instance type?\r\nOr maybe the reason is some other tenant in the shared dyno is using a lot of threads and making us fail? I don't know if that's possible or if there is a separate thread limit for each tenant...\r\n\r\nAnyway, since the mining code is single threaded, we should make the rust-code-analysis server use a single thread too, since we don't have any benefit from having multiple threads.\r\n\r\nIf it still fails after this, the WouldBlock could have a different cause (maybe running out of memory?).","closed_by":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
