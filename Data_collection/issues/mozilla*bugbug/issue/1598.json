I can't search a new word if I don't close the search in the previous tab\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nI think I should have the possibility to search a new word (for examle \"meat\") if i don't close the previous search (\"fish\") in the other tab. also it is not comfortable to close the search, I have to click the \"x\" in the lower right corner.
