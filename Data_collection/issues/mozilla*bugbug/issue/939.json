I think the training didn't happen at all.\r\n\r\n@ayush-1506 you can debug this locally, just build and run the docker image.\r\n```\r\ndocker build -t mozilla/bugbug-base-nlp -f infra/dockerfile.base-nlp .\r\ndocker run -it --rm mozilla/bugbug-base-nlp bash\r\n```\r\nThen in the Docker container, you can run the command from the task (https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/blob/029d93ada4221642f2bc65b1ce546ec1f0d40fec/infra/data-pipeline.yml#L481-L483):\r\n```\r\nbugbug-train-similarity --algorithm bm25\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother issue that we definitely need to solve is that the similarity module is building the `duplicates` map as soon as it is imported, and when it is imported the bugs database is not available yet (since we import at https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/blob/029d93ada4221642f2bc65b1ce546ec1f0d40fec/scripts/similarity_trainer.py#L13, and download the DB later at https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/blob/029d93ada4221642f2bc65b1ce546ec1f0d40fec/scripts/similarity_trainer.py#L47-L48).\r\nWe can simply move the `duplicates` map building to the `evaluation` function, since that's the only user of the map.","closed_by":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/939/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
