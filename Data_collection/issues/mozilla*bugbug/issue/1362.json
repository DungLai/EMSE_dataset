But this created a circular import and so `models.py` needs to import it down in the function below.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should move this class to a utility file or something. We could also consider moving more of the logic from `app.py` into it. E.g, instead of `get_result(job)` => `job.get_result()`. Instead of `schedule_job(job)` => `job.schedule()`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
