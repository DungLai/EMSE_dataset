I'm a researcher in nlp in the context of software engineering so this projects fits quite nicely. I'm trying to investigate if I can contribute something. \r\n\r\nI'm currently having some issues setting up the project to be able to work on it and understanding how the components work together (I'm new to the mozilla project structure):\r\n 1. Which mercurial version is currently supported?\r\n 2. Should I run the docker images?\r\n 3. How does the data handling work? \r\n  3.1 Lets say I want to train a new defect classifier, what data will be used? \r\n  3.2 Is there already a fixed train, validation and test split for comparison? Will that be created during training? Or do you always test on the newest commits? \r\n  3.3 Where to find the data downloaded when running  `python run.py --train --goal defect`\r\n  3.4 How to get the 100,000 bug reports (as mentioned in the article) from the last 2 years to train on?\r\n  3.5 What about the `repository.py` script? What data will that script download? Can I use that data to train a classifier as well? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/812/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
