WPT groups have very different characteristics than other groups, we have to figure out if the current model works well for those too or if some adjustments are needed.\r\nSome ideas to improve the situation (should it need to be improved):\r\n- split the model in two, one for each group of reasonably similar suites (e.g. one for WPT, one for the others; or one for WPT, one for mochitest/xpcshell, one for reftest/crashtest);\r\n- consider the suite of the manifest as a feature of the
