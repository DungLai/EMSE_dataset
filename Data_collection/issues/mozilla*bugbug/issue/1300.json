issue is just about adding an API call (with a hardcoded result) to the http service, preparing the ground for the actual API.\r\n\r\nIt should be similar to the bug classification API call (`model_prediction`), but its input will be a repository and a commit hash.\r\n\r\nAs part of this issue, we should:\r\n- add the API definition (in http_service/app.py);\r\n- the implementation of queuing the classification from the web dyno to the worker dyno using rq (again, in http_service/app.py, like we do for bugs).\r\n- a `select_tests` function in http_service/models.py which for now returns a hardcoded result.\r\n\r\nNote: the implementation should be simpler than the one for bugs, as we don't need (actually, we don't want to!) cache results.\r\n\r\nBlocks
