will actually run the data pipeline code, downloading, training, building the http service and running the http service for real only after doing a release.\r\n\r\nWe should have a lightweight integration testing before the release to have a minimum of confidence that the release will works.\r\n\r\nWe could train on a subset of data (few commits and few bugs) then ask the http service to classify the trained bugs to ensure we have a stable answer and that the whole pipeline runs quite
