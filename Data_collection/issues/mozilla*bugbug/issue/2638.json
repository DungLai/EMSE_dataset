But in particular we might want to filter out noise from backlog cleanups of very old bugs. Unfortunately there is no 100% safe way to do this. A working approximation could be:\r\n\r\nIf a bug is closed(INVALID,INACTIVE,INCOMPLETE,EXPIRED) and has been opened earlier than some date (like 1 year back), we do not consider it for the closed count. Note that this works only as expected if “some date” is earlier than the start date we use for ΔTime.\r\n\r\nThis \"some date\" could be a parameter.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jensstutte","id":55210859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjEwODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55210859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte","html_url":"https://github.com/jensstutte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensstutte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
