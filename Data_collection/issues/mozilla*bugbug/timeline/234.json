problem is with the changes I made locally, related to PR #229.\r\n\r\nFor [this](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/pull/229#discussion_r268796842), I did parse the data in _hg_log like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nfiles=rev[7].decode('utf-8').split('|'), \r\nfile_copies={fl[fl.find('(') + 1:-1]: fl[:fl.find('(') - 1] for fl in rev[8].decode('utf-8').split('|')},\r\n))\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAnd this makes the files a `list` and file_copies a `dictionary`. \r\nBut when this commit is passed as a key to author_experience, it shows:\r\n `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`\r\n\r\n\r\nSo should I pass them as a string
