I'm trying to do something like:\r\n```\r\n>>> import hglib\r\n>>> hg = hglib.open(\"mozilla-central\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`hg` in this case doesn't have a kwarg called template, according to the docs. What am I doing wrong? (Is there some problem in installing the extension?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/459694008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ayush1999","id":24913958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTEzOTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24913958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999","html_url":"https://github.com/ayush1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayush1999/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2111952510,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjExMTk1MjUxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/events/2111952510","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-01T11:32:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2111952511,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMTE5NTI1MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/events/2111952511","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-01T11:32:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/459700405","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/105#issuecomment-459700405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/105","id":459700405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTcwMDQwNQ==","user":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T12:00:06Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T12:00:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Ahhh, that's a pity.
