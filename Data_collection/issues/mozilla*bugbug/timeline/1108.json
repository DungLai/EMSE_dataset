have three questions.\r\n1. @marco-c  As you suggested I have gone through download(), is_old_schema(), download_check_etag() and extract_file(). I need some clarification. After calling the download_check_etag() function, download() function calls  extract_file(). I am wondering where (by which code) download() downloaded the DB. \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef download(path, support_files_too=False):\r\n    # If a DB with the current schema is not available yet, we can't download.\r\n    print('Path: ', path)\r\n    if is_old_schema(path):\r\n        return False\r\n    zst_path = f\"{path}.zst\"\r\n\r\n    url = DATABASES[path][\"url\"]\r\n    try:\r\n        logger.info(f\"Downloading {url} to {zst_path}\")\r\n        updated = utils.download_check_etag(url, zst_path)\r\n\r\n        if updated:\r\n            extract_file(zst_path)\r\n        successful = True\r\n        if support_files_too:\r\n            for support_file in DATABASES[path][\"support_files\"]:\r\n                successful |= download_support_file(path, support_file)\r\n\r\n        return successful\r\n    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError:\r\n        logger.info(f\"{url} is not yet available to download\", exc_info=True)\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In the first comment of download function, it says \r\n\r\n> If a DB with the current schema is not available yet, we can't download.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere current means new or latest? or existing? \r\n\r\n3. Another question is if I am getting the issue right the purpose is to ensure the DB schema is not updated in the server while we are downloading the DB. For that, we are planning to check the DB schema after downloading with the latest schema version of the server?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/569062416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"avijit1258","id":10563596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYzNTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10563596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258","html_url":"https://github.com/avijit1258","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2909122800,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkwOTEyMjgwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/events/2909122800","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-26T13:53:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2909122802,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MDkxMjI4MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/events/2909122802","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-26T13:53:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/569463087","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1108#issuecomment-569463087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1108","id":569463087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTQ2MzA4Nw==","user":{"login":"avijit1258","id":10563596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYzNTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10563596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258","html_url":"https://github.com/avijit1258","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avijit1258/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-29T00:38:52Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T00:38:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@marco-c
