an exact date? If we pass a date in the past, the `date and later` mode will download more than 1 file.\r\n- The `date and later` mode doesn't support the print to stdout option either which might be useful for scripts.\r\n- Do we have a specific file name pattern that could helps for https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/360?
