am not aware of anything.  The problem is interesting as we have so many variations we can be skipped on.  Some edge cases which can make this harder to solve:\r\n1) we don't support the test on android,etc. due to the OS not supporting features, so it is marked with `skip-if`\r\n2) it might be `skip-if = verify`, does that really count?\r\n3) it might be `skip-if = os == win7`, but we don't run this test on win7 (or whatever OS it is skipped on)\r\n4) when you add variants, some tests can run 80 times on a given push, skipping 1 specific config counts as skipped whereas another test can say `skip-if = linux` which could be skipping up to 30 configs.\r\n5) visualizing all of the configs + variants is difficult\r\n\r\nI would like to propose something more interesting- maybe what we ship on `!debug for linux64/windows/mac/android` - that is where we have the highest risk of missing coverage and letting regressions through.  I would be ok including debug, but asan, tsan, ccov, mingw32, and all the variants- we could provide that information in addition, but we need some way to really measure the risk.\r\n\r\nAn alternative I can think of is: \"test runs on X tier1/2 configs in CI (not with --full on try), it is skipped on Y of them\", then you have a 1-y/x=%skipped, which can be used to summarize all tests and put them in buckets, i.e. `389 tests, 5 are skipped <5% of configs, 2 are skipped 5-10%, and 3 are skipped >10% (or disabled)`\r\n\r\nwe still have issues outlined in the numbers above, but that gives everyone more actionable results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/1010025856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmaher","id":62588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher","html_url":"https://github.com/jmaher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmaher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
