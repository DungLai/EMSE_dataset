the dashboard is measuring the # of tasks scheduled, but we should probably track the total duration of all tasks instead. Some tasks are an order of magnitude longer than others and our metrics should take this into account.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we need the total time of the \"shadow scheduler\" tasks, and those don't all run on the push. So we can't just sum all the `task.duration`s. We'll need to query the average duration from ActiveData or something. Since these should be somewhat stable, we also likely don't want to re-query them *too* often (maybe cache results for a day or two)..\r\n\r\nAn argument can be made that this should live in the `ETL`, though I think this data (especially a cache of average runtimes) would be useful to other consumers as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozci/issues/102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/mozci/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3252350497,"node_id":"MDI2Ok1vdmVkQ29sdW1uc0luUHJvamVjdEV2ZW50MzI1MjM1MDQ5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/events/3252350497","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-20T15:39:34Z","project_card":{"id":35693974,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/35693974","project_id":4219501,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/4219501","column_name":"Next
