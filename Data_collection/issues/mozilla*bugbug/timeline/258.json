made some tests, it will be more complicated than i thought: setting up the Taskcluster cache is easy, but using it while building a Docker image is complex.\r\n\r\nThe protocol for mounting an host folder during an image build [is still an experimental feature](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/experimental.md) and has several limitations:\r\n\r\n- we can only use `mode=bind` for our use case\r\n- the source must be in the build context, so in the midlle of our repo...\r\n- but even with `readwrite` enabled, the doc says : **Written data will be discarded.**\r\n- which means we cannot really cache anything...\r\n\r\nI tested that with img and this Dockerfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental\r\nFROM alpine\r\n\r\nRUN echo 'taskboot !' > /etc/taskboot\r\nRUN --mount=type=bind,source=/.cache,target=/cache,rw \\\r\n  echo 'plop' > /cache/plop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build goes OK, but i don't have the `plop` file on my host cache... \r\n\r\nThe *old* way to do that is to `COPY` a cache in the image, then use a staging image... that's dirty too.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/482170647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"La0","id":101004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0","html_url":"https://github.com/La0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/482171617","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/258#issuecomment-482171617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/258","id":482171617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjE3MTYxNw==","user":{"login":"La0","id":101004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0","html_url":"https://github.com/La0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/La0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-11T15:50:36Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T15:50:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@marco-c
