It has one parent, and it has not been backed out.\r\n\r\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/7065c7171760 has one parent too, and it has been backed out by https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2b73321e629d.\r\n\r\nThere are a few possible ways to implement this:\r\n1) Figuring out if we can get the backout information directly using hg.log and a template (https://github.com/mozilla/version-control-tools/blob/d5db0980ab004b3aada29afdcf798a8a95520240/hgext/mozext/__init__.py#L137, https://github.com/mozilla/version-control-tools/blob/d5db0980ab004b3aada29afdcf798a8a95520240/hgtemplates/json/map);\r\n2) Generate a map of backouts by walking the list of commits and parsing the commit message (e.g. https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2b73321e629d says \"Backed out changeset 7065c7171760 ...\", so you can put 7065c7171760 -> 2b73321e629d in the map); then use the map when generating the commit information.\r\n\r\n1 would be best, but I'm not sure yet if it's feasible.
