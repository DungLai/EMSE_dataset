Using a list of the class which requires more than 1 argument.\r\n```\r\nclass is_developer():\r\n    def __call__(self, bug, extra):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n# in BugExtractor we can do this\r\nif type(f) in [is_developer]:\r\n    res = f(bug, extra)\r\nelse:\r\n    res = f(bug)\r\n```\r\n* But in this case, we need to maintain list manually.\r\n2. Using `inspect` module `signature` method\r\n- using signature method we can get the number of parameters function takes.\r\n```\r\nfrom inspect import signature\r\nif len(signature(f).parameters)>1:\r\n    res = f(bug, extra)\r\nelse:\r\n    res = f(bug)\r\n```\r\n- This implementation looks good and we don't have to maintain anything when we add new features.\r\n- I can't decide which pattern to use?

for the late reply. I need clarification on a couple of things. \r\nFirst, we are going to identify bug author made any commits. To do this i need to get list of all authors from commits data.\r\nIn `commits.json` data author is stored in one of the formats of `name <email>` or `name (email)` or name email.\r\nSome of the emails are in weird formats also\r\n1. 'Daniel Veditz <dveditz@mozilla.com> / Reed Loden <reed@mozilla.com>', 7275)\r\n2. mook.moz+hg%gmail.com\r\n3. Honza Bambas <honzab.moz>\r\n4. bobbyholley+bmo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nAbove list is `commits['author']` values. \r\n1. We can split the author with `r'[<>() ]'` and if it contains '@' I add it to the author list. This is the list of authors which did not match the pattern. https://pastebin.com/raw/0Fn03z23 . For the rest of the commits there is valid user email. Total `6080` unique authors and `376` unique invalid authors. \r\nIs there a better way to do this?
