should be in more specific components, but some things are just build system bugs, and there is not a more specific place to file them.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > For example, :glandium filed

:P\r\n\r\nI definitely could see an argument that it belongs in Task Configuration, but the reason I (and I guess Mike) didn't put it there is because it requires build system changes in addition to task changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/612241829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomprince","id":283816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/283816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince","html_url":"https://github.com/tomprince","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomprince/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/612361378","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1483#issuecomment-612361378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1483","id":612361378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjM2MTM3OA==","user":{"login":"sylvestre","id":733326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzMyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/733326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre","html_url":"https://github.com/sylvestre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvestre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-11T08:02:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T08:02:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
