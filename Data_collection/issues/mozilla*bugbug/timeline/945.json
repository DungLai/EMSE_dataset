 Issue #945 \r\nThis is not ready for review.\r\n\r\nIt was unclear from the contributing guidelines if you support \"Work in Progress [WIP]\" PRs, but I figured I'd submit one anyway.  Let me know if that's unfair to other contributors.  I'm also very open to collaborating on this with anyone else.\r\n\r\nI've been getting familiar with the codebase and installing all of the necessary dependencies.  I still need to better understand the metrics data format to figure out the best way to branch logic for binary classifiers.  I'm currently running the training script (saw that it can take ~30 minutes) and will explore that further.  \r\n\r\nIs there a unit test around this module?  I didn't see one, but wanted to make sure I modified it/added to it appropriately after my changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1640/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/691519853","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/945#issuecomment-691519853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/945","id":691519853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MTUxOTg1Mw==","user":{"login":"rishishounak","id":65448224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDQ4MjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65448224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak","html_url":"https://github.com/rishishounak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-12T17:23:00Z","updated_at":"2020-09-12T17:23:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to work on this but I dont have any previous experience so please guide me\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/691519853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rishishounak","id":65448224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDQ4MjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65448224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak","html_url":"https://github.com/rishishounak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rishishounak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/696556395","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/945#issuecomment-696556395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/945","id":696556395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjU1NjM5NQ==","user":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-22T07:30:25Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T07:30:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hello @rishishounak, you can follow the steps in the README to set the repository up, then you can run the scripts/retrieve_training_metrics.py script to make sure it works for you.

#945 \r\n\r\nI added plotting for classes '0' and '1' for binary classification models to `scripts/analyze_training_metrics.py`. Tested manually with `spambug` and `component` data fetched with the `scripts/retrieve_training_metrics.py` script.\r\n\r\nThe `analyze_training_metrics.py` was broken (because of how it extracted fields from file names), so I fixed that as well. It was not simple to install the environment due to some dependencies like xgboost and libgit2, but since they weren't necessary for this issue I simply skipped them.\r\n\r\nI think it should be ready to merge. Please confirm that this is what was intended for #945.\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever PR to an open source project.
