helped a lot: memory usage (on a Performance-M) on idle went from ~1,3 GB to ~100 MB.\r\n\r\nI'm trying switching to Standard-2X again to see if we have the same improvement there or if we have to tune jmalloc a bit (in particular, the number of arenas [narenas] is 4 times the number of CPUs, and on Standard-2X we have more CPUs than on Performance-M).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/610944426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/610982710","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1421#issuecomment-610982710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1421","id":610982710,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDk4MjcxMA==","user":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T14:10:25Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T14:49:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"![memusage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1616846/78794145-a3a7a000-79b3-11ea-81b4-ca84a12a070b.png)\r\n\r\nSo
