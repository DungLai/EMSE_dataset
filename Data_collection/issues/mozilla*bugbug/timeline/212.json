I executed `hg pull central` in the mercurial-central repository, however I'm not able to execute `hg up central` (I executed the vcs-setup). The output is: \r\n```\r\n> mozilla-central$ hg up central\r\n(third party extension push-to-try requires version 4.6 or newer of Mercurial; disabling)\r\n*** failed to import extension pushlog from ~/.mozbuild/version-control-tools/hgext/pushlog: No module named utils\r\n*** failed to import extension hgmo from ~/.mozbuild/version-control-tools/hgext/hgmo: No module named utils\r\n*** failed to import extension firefoxtree from ~/.mozbuild/version-control-tools/hgext/firefoxtree: 'module' object has no attribute 'getargspec'\r\nabort: unknown revision 'central'!\r\n``` \r\n\r\nHow shall I proceed from here? I can catch every exception in the `repository.py` script and execute the command without `--branch central`, but this seems somehow wrong. What am I doing wrong here?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/516817098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"villmow","id":2743060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDMwNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2743060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow","html_url":"https://github.com/villmow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villmow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/516820423","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/212#issuecomment-516820423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/212","id":516820423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjgyMDQyMw==","user":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-31T12:07:12Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T12:07:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"It looks like the mercurial extensions are not working (see the `failed to import extension ...` messages).\r\nWhich version of Mercurial are you using?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/516820423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
