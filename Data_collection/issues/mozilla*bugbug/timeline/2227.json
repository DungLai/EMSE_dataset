One recurring pattern that we did notice is that in bugs where the reporter does mention the work \"add-ons\" or \"extensions\" but in a negative form (e.g. `this issue is also reproducible in safe mode and with add-ons disabled` and other forms similar to this one) the bot seems to consider the fact that \"add-ons\" was part of the comment as something that contribute to the decision of moving the bug into the WebExtension component.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/796919904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rpl","id":11484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl","html_url":"https://github.com/rpl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4446564138,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ0NjU2NDEzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/events/4446564138","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-11T17:46:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4446564143,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NDY1NjQxNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/events/4446564143","actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-11T17:46:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
