fix for #20\r\n\r\nA few questions regarding this classifier:\r\n\r\n1. [class_names](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/blob/master/bugbug/model.py#L66) would need to be redefined, as it isn't valid for this classifier. (get_labels returns a dict where values are a list, not a string). I think the best option would be to remove it from the `train` method and make it an attribute, initializing it in the constructor. However, I'd need a green light before changing this.\r\n\r\n2. Similar to the presence of various tags for security bugs (https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/20#issuecomment-491064287), where can I find other tags that actually refer to the same bug type?\r\n\r\n@marco-c
