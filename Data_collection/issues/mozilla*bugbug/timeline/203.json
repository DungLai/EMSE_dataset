Because  I think there is no good enough interaction between the words of the documentation and the improvement in the performance.Because I feel the documentation of the feature will be only containing the details of the feature but the performance would depend on what algorithm we use,which language and framework we use and all that stuff.\r\n\r\nBut I think we can predict that  \"yes, lastly this feature's integration in this kind of direction won lots of people's hearts and lots of people were helped by this another kind of feature ,And the update we are thinking to make is a mixture of those feature in a similar kind of directions so this feature is probably going to make a good impact so we should focus on it \".\r\nTell me if I am going wrong because I know you are an
