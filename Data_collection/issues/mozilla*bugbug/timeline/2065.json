On one hand we should just only include closed bugs and clamp to `date` (i.e. the date it landed) but obv that's not going to work for the regressions chart or bugs by type chart since then you'd only show closed regressions / bugs.\r\n\r\nI almost wonder if these should just be separate charts (or separate bars on the same chart) for each. We'd have closed regressions / closed bugs by type where we group by date landed (which will only include bugs in our applied filter dates) and then separate charts for newly opened and unfixed regressions / bugs by type. It seems more relevant anyway - people wouldn't usually want to group opened and closed bugs together in the same line.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/759686697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bgrins","id":95570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins","html_url":"https://github.com/bgrins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/759691837","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2065#issuecomment-759691837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2065","id":759691837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTY5MTgzNw==","user":{"login":"bgrins","id":95570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins","html_url":"https://github.com/bgrins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-13T19:42:18Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T19:42:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The risk summary one happens to work because it clamps to 2 months.\r\n\r\nThis was incorrect.

that I'm just paging this back in so this may not be representative of the state today. But I think part of the problem is that when looking at, for example, regression fixes (a) I don't really care about the exact 'created date' for some bug that was filed in 2009 and fixed recently and (b) I need to see two completely separate data sources for \"filed but unfixed\" regressions and fixed regressions. Right now we stretch out the chart for (a), and we show everything in the same line for (b). I think both would be improved by having two separate graphs - one for fixed and one for unfixed.\r\n\r\nThen for (a) what we really care about (I think) is how many regressions there are and roughly how old they are. One way we could think about that for fixed bugs is a stacked bar chart with color codes for how old the fixed bugs are (something like https://apexcharts.com/javascript-chart-demos/column-charts/stacked/), where we see if a bug was > 1 year old, > 1 month, > 1 week, etc. This way we don't have to stretch the timeline all the way back to 2009.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/comments/766178250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bgrins","id":95570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins","html_url":"https://github.com/bgrins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgrins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"marco-c","id":1616846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTY4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1616846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c","html_url":"https://github.com/marco-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marco-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T17:46:08Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T17:46:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/issues/2191","id":816656317,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTY2NTYzMTc=","number":2191,"title":"Change
