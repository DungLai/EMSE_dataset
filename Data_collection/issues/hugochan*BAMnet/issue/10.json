I downloaded it and I saw a file called freebase_full.json. In this file, each element has its neighbors and paths directing to them. I checked the freebase dump which offered by google with sparql language, the paths that each element connects in your json file are not the all. Which means there are more paths should be connected by each element in freebase_full.json. Iâ€™m curious about how did you decide which path or neighbor should be added in each record? How did you build freebase_full.json file?\r\n\r\nAll the best, appreciate!\r\nSiqi Lai","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hugochan/BAMnet/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hugochan/BAMnet/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
