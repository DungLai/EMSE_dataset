I download your dataste. The train/test/valid files (raw_train.json/raw_valid.json/raw_test.json) both contain the \"freebaseKeyCands\" data. Where does the data \"freebaseKeyCands\" come fromï¼Ÿ It is the entity linking results by using Freebase Search API ? Could you provide the entity linking results by using Freebase Search API for me ? Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n@bunnyfighting Thank you for your interest to our work! The \"freebaseKeyCands\" field stores candidate topic entities from both Freebase Search API and S-MART, both of which are topic entity detection tools. Our proposed topic entity prediction module aims to predict the best topic entity from the candidate list. You can find information on how to get both Freebase Search API and S-MART results from
