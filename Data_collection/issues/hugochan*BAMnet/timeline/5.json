Is there any support for testing the model on new questions after training it? If not, how would you recommend going about building that functionality? Ideally I would like to deploy the model as an API.\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest to our work! It is doable but this functionality is not currently available. You will need to dynamically vectorize the input question and identify the topic entity, then feed them to the model. I am actually a bit busy recently. I will try implementing this in late Feb or early March. The topic entity identification is the most challenging one. The current model relies external tools for producing a list of candidates to select from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hugochan/BAMnet/issues/comments/588305345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hugochan","id":5065261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjUyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5065261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan","html_url":"https://github.com/hugochan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugochan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hugochan/BAMnet/issues/comments/753441252","html_url":"https://github.com/hugochan/BAMnet/issues/5#issuecomment-753441252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hugochan/BAMnet/issues/5","id":753441252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzQ0MTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"aorogat","id":53449461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQ5NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53449461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat","html_url":"https://github.com/aorogat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aorogat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-02T07:00:31Z","updated_at":"2021-01-02T07:00:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello.
