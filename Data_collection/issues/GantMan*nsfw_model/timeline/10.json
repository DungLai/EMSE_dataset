Training the entire dataset would be most impressive as I currently have around 30,000+ images per class.   Additionally, I've increased the batch size to 32, which means 16,000 images are pulled in each epoch.  Since I'm batching and using Stochastic Gradient Descent, I've found this to be a powerful method for continuous refinement of the model without overfitting.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have perturbation on the images, so that noise, rotation, and cropping is added randomly.  Making it mathematically infeasible that the same exact image would ever be used twice.\r\n\r\nAfter some serious re-training/refining I'd love for you to re-test my latest model.  I'm getting around 93% accuracy.  This was trained longer on an even larger dataset.\r\n\r\n#### Side note:\r\nYou say you're not familiar with Keras, if you use some other method, I'd love for you to contribute.  I'm planning on writing a Tensorflow JS training version.  It would be entertaining to see which ML framework performs best.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/469791090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GantMan","id":997157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2181794398,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxODE3OTQzOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/events/2181794398","actor":{"login":"GantMan","id":997157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-05T18:13:33Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/470027466","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/10#issuecomment-470027466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/10","id":470027466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDAyNzQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"misterDDF","id":48198883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTk4ODgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48198883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF","html_url":"https://github.com/misterDDF","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterDDF/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T09:08:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T09:08:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
