I am still in university but I'm trying to do side projects just to learn how to build web apps. nothing fancy or anything, but just small things to learn how things work etc to build my skillset in being able to build the web apps, or software that connects to web services, etc.\r\n\r\nI know with how fast AI is developing, 3 years is like an eternity, but from all the Googling I've been doing, your GitHub has really been the most helpful in terms of me learning. Or maybe I am Googling wrong, any resources you can point me towards allowing me to build a stronger model?\r\n\r\nAnything would honestly be very helpful, I have spent more time trying to figure this out then I will admit lol. I know more Python, but I know JS is really where a lot of web app development is happening so I have ben trying to get more into JS too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/1368565522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DankMemeGuy","id":20292224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjkyMjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20292224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy","html_url":"https://github.com/DankMemeGuy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DankMemeGuy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/1368565811","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/117#issuecomment-1368565811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/117","id":1368565811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCe50yM5Rkqgz","user":{"login":"GantMan","id":997157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-01T23:30:19Z","updated_at":"2023-01-01T23:30:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"One
