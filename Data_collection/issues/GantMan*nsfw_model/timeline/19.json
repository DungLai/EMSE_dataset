I think you need to define a model to decide whether the video is nsfw based on discrete frame detection output. Moreover, your fixed frames can be cracked if someone intends.

@xcbtrader Yeah, saving frames to disk and then calling the predict function is very time taking. I will ad a function to process a video directly. I will also add a paramter in that function so that you can select how many frames you want to analyze. eg: n=1 will analyze all frames and n=0.5 will analyze only half of randomly selected frames each second. Would this work for you?\r\n\r\nHas this been implemented yet? I haven't found any reference to this function.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm extracting frames from a video with ffmpeg, and sending them in batch to the predict method. I've found that doing this with up to 5 videos at once really kills the CPU. I'm using a 4 core CPU with 8 gigs of RAM. Any recommendation on the hardware requirements part for such a task for analyzing multiple videos at once","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/584634355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"remusnegrota","id":5381685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODE2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5381685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota","html_url":"https://github.com/remusnegrota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remusnegrota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3026540517,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAyNjU0MDUxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/events/3026540517","actor":{"login":"xcbtrader","id":7623491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjM0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7623491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader","html_url":"https://github.com/xcbtrader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-11T13:29:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3026540522,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMjY1NDA1MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/events/3026540522","actor":{"login":"xcbtrader","id":7623491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjM0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7623491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader","html_url":"https://github.com/xcbtrader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xcbtrader/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-11T13:29:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/586494102","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/19#issuecomment-586494102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/19","id":586494102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjQ5NDEwMg==","user":{"login":"GantMan","id":997157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-14T22:14:40Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T22:14:40Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Nothing
