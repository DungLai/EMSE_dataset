So if you want to collect and colorize ~6 thousand images of nazis, you can drop them into a folder and train a classifier that includes this. \r\n\r\nI'm not the repo owner but I think this falls outside the scope of \"nsfw\" as most people can and should learn real history, which includes bad things, so we can understand why they're bad. Generally the goal here is that we want to filter sexual imagery.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/632165400/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TechnikEmpire","id":11234763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire","html_url":"https://github.com/TechnikEmpire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/632349385","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/63#issuecomment-632349385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/63","id":632349385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjM0OTM4NQ==","user":{"login":"GantMan","id":997157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-21T21:13:48Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T21:13:48Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Agreed,
