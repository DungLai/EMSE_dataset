If I understand it correctly, the messages are printed, not logged.\r\nI managed to modify the nsfw_detector module and remove the `print(img_path, \"size:\", image_size)` which got me rid of the **images/x.jpg size: (224, 224)** message, but the **1/1 [==============================] - 1s 552ms/step** is still present and I don't see a print statement for that. I've even searched .py files from libraries that are imported in the nsfw_detector, but none of them has a print statement like that either. I have no idea where it comes from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/1236193721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"N4rral","id":95480175,"node_id":"U_kgDOBbDpbw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95480175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral","html_url":"https://github.com/N4rral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N4rral/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
