Thanks for helping me out with trying to get my content filtering going, it looks like you've been down this road already with Technik Empire. And thanks for mentioning Intel DLDT, I'll be checking that out down the road. \r\n\r\nI'm hitting another roadblock unfortunately but this seems to be an issue with the framework not supporting QuantizeV2 (whatever that is) rather than a issue with this model.  I'll have to try and find more robust framework to integrate newer TF models in WPF C# applications.  \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.ML.Transforms.TensorFlow.TFException: 'No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'QuantizeV2' used by {{node block_4_expand/convolution_eightbit/block_4_expand/kernel/read/quantize}}with these attrs: [T=DT_QUINT8, round_mode=\"HALF_AWAY_FROM_ZERO\", mode=\"MIN_FIRST\"]`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/596331115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3109166872,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzEwOTE2Njg3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/events/3109166872","actor":null,"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T04:55:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3109166877,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEwOTE2Njg3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/events/3109166877","actor":{"login":"TechnikEmpire","id":11234763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire","html_url":"https://github.com/TechnikEmpire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T04:55:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3109166878,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMDkxNjY4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/events/3109166878","actor":{"login":"TechnikEmpire","id":11234763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire","html_url":"https://github.com/TechnikEmpire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnikEmpire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T04:55:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
