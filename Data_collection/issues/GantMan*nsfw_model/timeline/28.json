Found two factors that affect the results: image resize params and model quantization. I have checked the nsfwjs source code, which use bilinear interpolation. And i also compared results between normal model and quantized model, quantized model gives more reasonable predictions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/500314973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sodagreat","id":24327697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzI3Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24327697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat","html_url":"https://github.com/sodagreat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sodagreat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/comments/502661231","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/28#issuecomment-502661231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/28","id":502661231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjY2MTIzMQ==","user":{"login":"GantMan","id":997157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan","html_url":"https://github.com/GantMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GantMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-17T12:25:44Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T12:25:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"This is news to me!
