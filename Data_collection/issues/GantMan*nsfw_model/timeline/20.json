currently testing this interesting nsfwjs module on a live server.\r\n\r\nI activate this code:\r\npdModel = await nsfwjs.load('model/');\r\n\r\nvia a call to an async function triggered by the onLoad event. \r\nThe 6 model files are fetched from the disk and is using approximately 960ms to load (I see this using Chrome inspector - Network tab).\r\nAfter this I have to wait approx. 5-6 seconds before I get any response from the page. From what happens in the Memory tab in Inspector, it looks like the nsfwjs load is using this time to do something. \r\n\r\nAfter the 5-6 seconds. I can select an image. When that is done, this code (in another async function):\r\nvar img = new Image();\r\nimg.src = document.getElementById('img_url').src;\r\nvar predictions = await pdModel.classify(img);\r\nconsole.log('Predictions', predictions);\r\n\r\nis using about 1,5 - 2 seconds to finish. \r\nThis is acceptable time for me.\r\nThis time usage of about 1.5 -2 seconds - is consistent.\r\n\r\nBut the usage of 5-6 seconds nsfwjs use to do something - before anything else can happen in the page (e.g. select an image to analyze), is quite a long time - for an end user which want to do something as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nSo... is there a way to speed up the time nsfwjs uses to finish this part: \r\npdModel = await nsfwjs.load('model/');\r\nand whatever it does before the page is ready for handling user triggered events in the page?\r\n\r\nCould the preparation work done by nsfwjs (these first 5-6 seconds) maybe be split up in 2 parts, and then do half the job - onLoad, and then the second part - which is triggered to happen when an image actually is selected by the user?
