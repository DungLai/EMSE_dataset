I write just enough to serve my AI/ML needs and lately I've been kicking butt over in JavaScript where the fruits of this project have gone far and wide (https://nsfwjs.com/ and https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs)\r\n> \r\n> This project used to run back with TF 1.0 and since then it's had a few people show up and help. I could really use the help in getting it in shape, bc I've personally been focused with other things for a couple years. The issue is that I haven't touched the Python side in a long time.\r\n> \r\n> If you're willing to do the open source work to get the model working like you want, I'd make you a collaborator for the project.\r\n\r\nI also have limited know-how of Tf, but I am willing to help here. Please let me know how can we collaborate on improving this further.
