Should I use the 60 gbs or that would be overkill since the model already can already classify the 5 original classes.\r\n2.- How much data do you think i need for the new class?\r\n\r\nBtw im so grateful for your code, especially the mobilenet version! how long did it take to train that model?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCya!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
