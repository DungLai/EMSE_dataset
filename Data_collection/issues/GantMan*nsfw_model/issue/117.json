I have the images that are categorized, just not sure how to actually go about training a model. Can you maybe show how images have to laid out, then the steps to run the images through a model etc?\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GantMan/nsfw_model/issues/117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
