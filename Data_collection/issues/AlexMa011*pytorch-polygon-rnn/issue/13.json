In the `newdataset`-class, how are you encoding each polygon, and how is the output of `newdataset.__getitem__` supposed to be interpreted? \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexMa011/pytorch-polygon-rnn/blob/d7d4194bd73795cdc5bd78d1b4cb4dc7361d8a13/data.py#L29-L71\r\n\r\nIf you could provide some insight in your thought process, that would be lovely!\r\nCheers in advance!
