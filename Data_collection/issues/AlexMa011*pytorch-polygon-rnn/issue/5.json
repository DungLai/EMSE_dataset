One of the reasons why we have a first point network in our model instead of using any first point in the RNN (using a start token) is because a polygon is circularly symmetrical (which is not the case for language), and therefore the first point is not a well defined object. \r\n\r\nIt'd be interesting to know what scores you got on Cityscapes since I see you said in another issue that it was better than the polygon-rnn from CVPR 2017.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAmlan","closed_by":{"login":"amlankar","id":7633212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MzMyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7633212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar","html_url":"https://github.com/amlankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amlankar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AlexMa011/pytorch-polygon-rnn/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AlexMa011/pytorch-polygon-rnn/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
