In the paper, we prepare the data by also removing occlusions from the masks -- the polygons provided directly in cityscapes might or might not have the occlusion removed, since they actually solve occlusion using depth ordering while preparing the pixel wise instance/semantic map.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling this is the reason why your numbers are so much higher, it'd be great to see how much this repository gets using our pre-processed data!
