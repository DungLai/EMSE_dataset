I'm not sure I understand the question, so I'll just give the answer a shot. Feel free to ask a follow-up question if anything remains unclear.\r\n\r\nIt seems that you're confused about `A`, `A_tilde`, and `A_hat` in the proof of Eq. (17). Specifically, the confusion seems to be about the first full-row equation in the proof `[A_hat_square]_{uv} = â€¦`. The difference between `A_tilde` and `A` is subtle. As specified right below Eq. (1), `A_tilde` is the adjacency matrix with added self-loops (via adding the identity matrix). `A_hat`, on the other hand, is the degree-normalized version of `A_tilde` (see below Eq. (2)). \r\n\r\nIn the proof we use at several places the fact that diagonal elements `A_{uu}=0` as we consider graphs without self-loops, while `A_tilde_{uu}=1` because we added the self-loops.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/comments/1086671527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danielzuegner","id":22178797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc4Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22178797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6357593351,"node_id":"CE_lADOCBou0c5GgwIlzwAAAAF68S0H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/events/6357593351","actor":{"login":"ThatDanielLiu","id":24885799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODg1Nzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24885799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ThatDanielLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-03T01:11:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/comments/1086753980","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/13#issuecomment-1086753980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/13","id":1086753980,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCBou0c5Axoy8","user":{"login":"ThatDanielLiu","id":24885799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODg1Nzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24885799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ThatDanielLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThatDanielLiu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-03T01:18:59Z","updated_at":"2022-04-03T01:18:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">
