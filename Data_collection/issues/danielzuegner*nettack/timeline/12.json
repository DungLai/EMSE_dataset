This has the effect that for these elements we prefer changes in the negative direction, i.e. setting them to zero. What's missing is setting the gradients to zero for elements where the gradient points into an invalid direction. However, this case would only happen if there was **no** element where a valid perturbation leads to an increase in loss, which we have never observed in practice. So I don't see a problem here.\r\n\r\nRegarding your question about structure vs attribute perturbations: Did you make sure to set the corresponding flag that both structure and attributes are perturbed? In general, structure perturbations are much more effective so it is not surprising that a vast majority of perturbations are structure perturbations. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have follow-up questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/comments/1007988350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danielzuegner","id":22178797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc4Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22178797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/comments/1007997444","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/12#issuecomment-1007997444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/12","id":1007997444,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCBou0c48FNIE","user":{"login":"KennyNH","id":63087259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDg3MjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63087259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH","html_url":"https://github.com/KennyNH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyNH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-08T13:51:10Z","updated_at":"2022-01-08T13:51:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
