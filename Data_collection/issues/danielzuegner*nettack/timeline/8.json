The first question you have to answer is how to use GCN for graph classification. I don't think there's an established way to do that, but the version with the virtual node could work. \r\n\r\nRegarding attacking multiple nodes simultaneously: that is definitely possible but will require some coding. The main question I see is how to decide which perturbation to perform: I guess a reasonable starting point would be to always perform the perturbation that yields the largest increase in loss over the whole set of nodes under attack. If these sets of nodes are to become relatively large, say more than 5 or 10 nodes, I would refer you to our [latest work](https://github.com/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack) in which we basically attack all nodes in the graph simultaneously. You could modify the code to attack, say, a certain 10% of the nodes that you are interested in.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can further assist you.\r\n\r\nDaniel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/comments/495101571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danielzuegner","id":22178797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc4Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22178797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/comments/499224870","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/8#issuecomment-499224870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/8","id":499224870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTIyNDg3MA==","user":{"login":"cshjin","id":4164048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjQwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4164048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin","html_url":"https://github.com/cshjin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T19:36:02Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T19:36:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your insightful comments.
