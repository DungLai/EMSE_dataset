Those nodes are coming from the same graph in order to mispredict the graph. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cshjin","id":4164048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjQwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4164048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin","html_url":"https://github.com/cshjin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshjin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/nettack/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
