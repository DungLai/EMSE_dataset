But padding adds zeros in the data. So why we are aimed to equalize the length of the audio signal with zeros? If we are adding zeros in the data, will it distort original data, if yes then we are padding the data? \r\n\r\nMy second question is that how voice data is normalized, did you normalize the data in current project?
