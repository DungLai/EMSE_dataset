The default 'accuracy' of Keras is the binary accuracy. This is responsible for the difference in accuracies. We are interested in binary accuracy here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition/issues/comments/427910255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hkveeranki","id":12495975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1OTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12495975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki","html_url":"https://github.com/hkveeranki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1890852216,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg5MDg1MjIxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition/issues/events/1890852216","actor":{"login":"hkveeranki","id":12495975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1OTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12495975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki","html_url":"https://github.com/hkveeranki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkveeranki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-08T17:08:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ramesh720","id":43946769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQ2NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43946769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720","html_url":"https://github.com/ramesh720","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh720/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T09:15:27Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T09:15:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition/issues/4","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition/issues/4/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition/issues/4/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition/issues/4/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hkveeranki/speech-emotion-recognition/issues/4","id":370069622,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzAwNjk2MjI=","number":4,"title":"regarding
