Where N is number of samples you want to predict and M is the feature vector for each of the samples. So in this case you would need to extract the feature vector and pass them instead of the filename of the wav file. Then you should be able to predict its label. This reminds me that there is no direct method available in utilities to do this. I will try to add methods necessary to do this.
