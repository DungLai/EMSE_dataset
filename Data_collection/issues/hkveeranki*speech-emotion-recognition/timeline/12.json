Ideally you shouldn't be using them but instead use one of its child classes which implements all the methods and has the constructor. \r\n2. I made the package installable by providing a `setup.py` I don't know how it works in google colab but on a pc/laptop you should be install by running `python setup.py install --local` in your terminal from the package directory. This will enable to use this package wherever you want.\r\n3. Can you try using one of the given models or implement a new Model as child class to one of the above mentioned classes and then see if the training works?\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment here if you have any other questions.
