most probably it's a late reply,\r\nI've looked up, both in the API documentation and in the source code of the SDK it is not described how to get the audio feed from Vector's microphone.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging, it appears that this functionality existed at some point, but it was removed: https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk/pull/20/commits/140d0aaa439e54dc3396c01d8342ea405493090c\r\ndue to the functionality most likely being experimental and needing proper documentation/refinement/refactoring before the release of `v0.6.0`, after which the project has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nIf anyone with python skills can look into this, and extract back the feature, that would be great.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/comments/1298694242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"otanim","id":7108843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDg4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim","html_url":"https://github.com/otanim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otanim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7714372418,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCYCp4M4mgv2ezwAAAAHLz_tC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/events/7714372418","actor":{"login":"krisnova","id":13757818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU3ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13757818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova","html_url":"https://github.com/krisnova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T15:20:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7714372433,"node_id":"SE_lADOCYCp4M4mgv2ezwAAAAHLz_tR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/events/7714372433","actor":{"login":"krisnova","id":13757818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzU3ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13757818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova","html_url":"https://github.com/krisnova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisnova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T15:20:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
