let me extend sincere appreciation for what Anki has done up to this point and my sympathy for those who have lost work due to this unfortunate situation. \r\n\r\nThat said, I've thought much about this and see a few ways forward:\r\n\r\n- Anki simply shuts down the cloud service and Vector, at least as we knew him, is gone. Considering the community built around this little robot and the fact that Anki marketed him as a companion robot, I surely hope that this doesn't happen, as it will be terribly difficult on those who have grown attached to him. \r\n- Anki, in some form, arranges to keep the servers up and running for some period of time before shutting them down. This is not much better than the first option, but it would buy some time to sort through some of the other options.\r\n- Anki sells its IP to someone else to steward. IMO, Sphero seems like a fantastic home for Vector and Cozmo, although I can't say whether or not they would be interested. But it would seem like a great match, adding Vector and Cozmo to Sphero's line of educational robots.\r\n- Anki agrees to open-source all or parts of its server-side software so that the community can build, evolve, and run it as they like, on their own hardware or in the cloud. I understand that during times like this a company's greatest assets moving forward are some of its proprietary bits, so if Anki wants to retain some of the most valuable assets, that would be understandable. But it would be great if they could *at least* open source the specifications for the server-side code (perhaps with a slimmed down implementation as a basis) so that the community could build on that from the ground up. This would also require changes in Vector's firmware and the companion iOS/Android apps to be able to specify a custom server location.\r\n\r\nGiven that a new SDK was released less than 24 hours ago and since the announcement, and because the servers are still alive the last I checked, I am hopeful that there are discussions already taking place to arrange for a new life for Vector going forward. I hope that those with the power to make and act on these decisions will read this message as well as the cries on the forums and Reddit and do everything in their power to keep Vector alive and chirping for years to come, even if it means releasing some of the server-side bits to another entity or to the open-source community.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/comments/488550271/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"habuma","id":167926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma","html_url":"https://github.com/habuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habuma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/comments/489090527","html_url":"https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/23#issuecomment-489090527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/23","id":489090527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTA5MDUyNw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-03T13:13:29Z","updated_at":"2019-05-03T13:13:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is the message Shawn Blakesley (one of Anki developers) left on Github in response to what customers can do to try and keep as much functionality as possible with their Vectors :\r\n\r\nI don't have any information about future Vector functionality.

If so, it would be great, but I thought Vector SDK custom programs do not communicate directly with Vector on local network. \r\nThe programs built with SDK would send commands to Anki Server and then Anki Server would relay the commands to registered Vector units -including RC programs. This may mean that SDK custom programs would also stop working when Anki Server shuts down. \r\nI hope I am wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/comments/569402690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lukewkywacko","id":15171375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTcxMzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15171375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko","html_url":"https://github.com/lukewkywacko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukewkywacko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/comments/569403169","html_url":"https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/23#issuecomment-569403169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anki/vector-python-sdk/issues/23","id":569403169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTQwMzE2OQ==","user":{"login":"RamblingGeekUK","id":7108949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDg5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7108949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK","html_url":"https://github.com/RamblingGeekUK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RamblingGeekUK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-28T09:56:09Z","updated_at":"2019-12-28T09:56:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
