It's the cleanest code I get to work with, and I love how absolutely consistent it is across the board. \r\n\r\nSecond, I'm working on a side project with the Vector for the next couple of months, and I would love to contribute upstream. It seems like this library is still needing some fleshing out that tends to come from people using it for purposes not originally intended by the authors, so I'd like to be part of the solution.\r\n\r\nMy first problem I've encountered:\r\nHow do I move in reverse? I see a reference to moving in reverse [in the behavior.py](https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk/blob/ac12ccb762a232c1afbb170b825189785759abce/anki_vector/behavior.py) motion profile map. I also see it in the protobuf defs. However, it doesn't seem actually usable.\r\n\r\n**Proposal 1:**\r\nrobot.behavior.drive_straight(\r\n    distance=Distance(distance_mm= **-** 100)\r\n    speed=Speed(speed_mmps=70)\r\n)\r\n\r\n**Proposal 2:**\r\nrobot.behavior.drive_straight(\r\n    distance=Distance(distance_mm=100)\r\n    speed=Speed(speed_mmps= **-** 70)\r\n)\r\n\r\n**Proposal 3:**\r\nrobot.behavior.drive_straight(\r\n    distance=Distance(distance_mm=100)\r\n    speed=Speed(speed_mmps=70),\r\n    **reverse=True**\r\n)\r\n\r\nMy initial thought is that \"Proposal 2\" would fit best with the paradigm of 'velocity' having to do with direction, but with that in mind, might be confusing to newcomers, in which case reverse=True would be ideal.\r\n\r\nEither way, let me know where I can help contribute to the sdk.
