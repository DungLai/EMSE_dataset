It doesn't assume the state based on the moves it chose. The only way for the bot to have thought its `spa` had dropped would be if the PS server sent a message indicating so, something like \r\n\r\n```\r\n|-unboost|p2a: rotomheat|spa|2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual log from turn 21 is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|turn|21\r\n|\r\n|t:|1647901897\r\n|move|p2a: rotomheat|Overheat|p1a: kommoo|[miss]\r\n|-miss|p2a: rotomheat|p1a: kommoo\r\n|move|p1a: kommoo|Drain Punch|p2a: rotomheat\r\n|-damage|p2a: rotomheat|21/100 tox\r\n|\r\n|-damage|p2a: rotomheat|3/100 tox|[from] psn\r\n|upkeep\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the above message to tell the bot to drop it's special attack.\r\n\r\nWhat you're observing is just one of the many problems with the bot. I can't say 100% what happened without the bot's logs, but what I suspect is that on turn 22 the bot thought kommo-o outsped the bot's rotom-h (yes there is evidence that the rotom outspeeds kommo-o but the bot can't perfectly detect those things). When the bot is put into situations like this where it thinks it will certainly lose the interaction, it make really dumb decisions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/1079729468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/1100897440","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/104#issuecomment-1100897440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/104","id":1100897440,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpNhO85Bnlyg","user":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-17T15:10:45Z","updated_at":"2022-04-17T15:10:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Going
