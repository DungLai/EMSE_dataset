Dynamax as a mechanic is really hard to implement using a search algorithm that can only see 2 or 3 turns ahead. Since it was banned in major formats I decided to ignore it completely.\r\n\r\nThe compromise I added was that the bot will always dynamax on the last pokemon if dynamax is available, but won't understand the effects of the MaxMoves. I guess understanding of the MaxMoves could be added, but its really just not worth the effort in my opinion. I would accept pull-requests adding this feature though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/982141601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/989284663","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/86#issuecomment-989284663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/86","id":989284663,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpNhO84690k3","user":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T22:39:05Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T22:39:05Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing this.
