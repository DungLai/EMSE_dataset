Each [side](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/8fcbf4287c0989934976a544fe7fa2cd4d505b87/showdown/engine/objects.py#L124) has an attribute called `reserve` which is a Python dictionary. The keys for this dictionary are the Pokemon names and, as you can imagine, this does not allow for Pokemon with duplicate names to exist. The KeyError itself is a by-product that occurs when trying to find the transposition for switching twice in a row.\r\n\r\nI will fix this - I'll just need to investigate the best way to go about refactoring the representation of the reserve pokemon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/485596934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2292608844,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyOTI2MDg4NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/events/2292608844","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-23T00:22:09Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/593311873","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/3#issuecomment-593311873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/3","id":593311873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MzMxMTg3Mw==","user":{"login":"fwqefwqef","id":46618311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjE4MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46618311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef","html_url":"https://github.com/fwqefwqef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwqefwqef/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-02T09:39:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-02T09:39:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, is this bug fixed yet?
