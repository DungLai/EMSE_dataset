How could i do this ?\r\n\r\nTwo ways you can do this:\r\n\r\n1. You can set up two bots and a local Pokemon-Showdown server. Set the configurations accordingly and let them play against each other. This will be slow because of needing to communicate with the PokemonShowdown server.\r\n2. Use the engine directly to simulate battles. This ~will~ might be faster, but note that the engine in this project is not a perfect Pokemon battle engine. There are things missing.
