Running without Docker requires the user to set up their own Gambit binaries - it's more of a headache to do that than to run Docker. Yeah the Docker image is based on an ubuntu image ([reference](https://github.com/pmariglia/gambit-docker/blob/68e53b7e1a9d7ea671d77e61a2c6262867eb0529/Dockerfile#L1)) - the image size could probably be brought down by using something like Debian-slim, but not by too much. I can make that change when I get the chance but if you want to run without Docker you'll need to compile the [Gambit ](https://github.com/gambit/gambit)binaries on your own machine, and then use [this environment variable ](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/294bf4990d29ecd87d310a47f68afa21eb873c75/Dockerfile#L19) to point to the `gambit-enummixed` binary.\r\n\r\n2. At all? If it isn't considering switches then that is a bug, but you'll have to provide more context/evidence. Or does it just not switch in situations where you think it should switch? The bot isn't perfect - far from it and I never claimed it was. The decisions are just based off of the algorithm being used.\r\n\r\n3. I do not have the background knowledge nor the interest in doing this right now.\r\n\r\n4.
