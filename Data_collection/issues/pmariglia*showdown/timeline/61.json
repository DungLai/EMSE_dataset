Each of the moves have a 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% chance of being present, respectively. What is the score modification ratio you would apply? Are you only generating states where 4 moves are assumed per Pokemon, or are you generating states where they can have any number of moves? If it is the former, then there is also information that the Smogon stats do not provide - like \"how likely is this set of 4 moves?\". It gets complicated rather quickly.\r\n\r\nAnyway, _if_ you know what you want to do, here's where you'd do it.\r\n\r\n[This is where the states are generated ](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/9c4ebaa736a8c1f044a36279578578ea3dd1f9d0/showdown/battle_bots/safest/main.py#L28)(in the `safest` battle-bot anyways). What I'd recommend is adding a `state_multiplier` attribute to each [state](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/master/showdown/engine/objects.py#L25-L26) object that is generated. Then, when [evaluating the state](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/9c4ebaa736a8c1f044a36279578578ea3dd1f9d0/showdown/engine/evaluate.py#L101), you can simply multiply by your multiplier.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/789276784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/793516822","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/61#issuecomment-793516822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/61","id":793516822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MzUxNjgyMg==","user":{"login":"mancho1987","id":59088002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg4MDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59088002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987","html_url":"https://github.com/mancho1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-09T08:06:09Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T08:06:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, it did help!

Even a new bot consistently beating the old bot doesn't necessarily mean it will be better on the ladder.\r\n\r\n> By the way, what do you think of this idea I just had:\r\nCalculating for the 2 best moves insteas of just the best one, and then among just those two moves, search another turn or two ahead (using the 2 depth worst case scenario for each as their starting point) to decide which one to choose.\r\nSo for example, if the two best moves are psychic and recover, and their worst case scenarios for each respectively are if opponent plays surf + surf, surf + toxic, then it would search one or two more turns ahead only for those specific states.\r\nDo you see this helping in something? Would it make it much slower?\r\n\r\nIt would make it much much slower, and the algorithm isn't exactly clear on how it works just by your definition alone.. By _using the 2 depth worst case scenario for each as their starting point_ you'd get two pairs of moves, one for the turn you are currently on and one for... the state that those first two moves transpose the current state into?\r\n\r\nBut wait.. what if there is randomness associated with the first pair of moves? Now what? Should you look at all transpositions and apply expectiminimax to that once again based on probability? That's slow. Assuming each move has 1 piece of randomness (2 outcomes), thats 4 total states from two pairs of moves - and that is _per turn_, we are talking about an initial 2 turns here. So you'd end up needing to search an additional turn for probably an average of at least 10+ states (I'm just guessing here).\r\n\r\nNow, alpha-beta pruning would definitely help eliminate searching through some of these states so it's probably not as bad as I'm making it out to be. I'm guessing this bot would end up taking ~30 seconds per move or so (at least for a machine like mine....)\r\n\r\nBy all means I'd love for someone to try it and report back - but I don't see it improving the bot too much. I think the bot could search 10+ turns and still be crap. Minimax is the wrong way to play pokemon, there's just too much randomness. Competitive Pokemon is about determining win-conditions, identifying how to put yourself in a position where you can sweep, and balancing tradeoffs of moves (usually due to potential hax).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/798923125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/798929326","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/61#issuecomment-798929326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/61","id":798929326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5ODkyOTMyNg==","user":{"login":"mancho1987","id":59088002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg4MDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59088002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987","html_url":"https://github.com/mancho1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-14T15:44:17Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T15:44:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I understand that.

Still need to work on it though, it's far from good 😅","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/798929326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mancho1987","id":59088002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg4MDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59088002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987","html_url":"https://github.com/mancho1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mancho1987/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/798941950","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/61#issuecomment-798941950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/61","id":798941950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5ODk0MTk1MA==","user":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-14T17:04:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T17:04:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Yeah the difference between seeing 2 turns ahead versus 3 is likely negligible when it comes to using expectiminimax in Pokemon.\r\n\r\nIf you have changes for better understanding items/abilities/etc. then I'd love for those changes to be contributed back to the main branch.\r\n\r\n> I have tried to add some logic to help it do exactly that (identify sweepers and getting into a position where it can sweep).
