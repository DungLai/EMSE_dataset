It seems from my initial scan that the code was only inteded to be used alongside the official PS battle system as a guide for the bot itself.\r\n\r\nThe engine code can run full battles. There are some examples of how to use the engine in [ENGINE.md](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/master/ENGINE.md) (might be a tad out of date).\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want to mass simulate battles you may want to consider using the [official PokemonShowdown simulator](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown) as it is a much more complete engine. The engine in my project was written to be a \"best-effort\" implementation for only competitive singles: Lots of interactions are not present. The only reason you should use this engine over the PS engine (and the reason I wrote it in the first place) is if you want to be able to determine all of the possible transpositions that may occur when two moves are selected from a certain state. If you just want to simulate battles you should use the PS engine.\r\n\r\n> (also just a side query -- do you have any strong limitations for py36 being your only supported version? happy to investigate if otherwise to port to more modern versions since py36 is officially deprecated by numpy etc.)\r\n\r\nI'm almost certain this code will work with anything 3.6+ due to the backwards compatibility of Python. I'll update the README & the Github Actions runner to use a more recent version when I get a chance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/1200461032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/1200474842","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/115#issuecomment-1200474842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/115","id":1200474842,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpNhO85Hjcra","user":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-31T18:21:43Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T18:21:51Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Python
