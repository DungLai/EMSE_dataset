I love it when more people become interested in writing Pokemon bots.\r\n\r\nI'm totally not against some refactoring to allow this to be possible - better separating the battle parsing from the decision logic is on a to-do list of mine. \r\n\r\nRight now I think you can _kind of_ do what you want by writing your own [find_best_move](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/8c686f65b03113926c7e0b032a2473105f15022a/showdown/engine/select_best_move.py#L208) function. The input is a [Battle](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/8c686f65b03113926c7e0b032a2473105f15022a/showdown/battle.py#L42) object with everything that is known with certainty about the state of the battle.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the two decision making methods in this project are [find_best_move_safest](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/8c686f65b03113926c7e0b032a2473105f15022a/showdown/engine/select_best_move.py#L180) and [find_best_move_nash](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/8c686f65b03113926c7e0b032a2473105f15022a/showdown/engine/select_best_move.py#L196). The input to these two are a list of battles, which are meant to represent **all likely** battles based on usage statistics.\r\n\r\nWith that being said I do agree that we can better define these boundaries. Let's talk about how we can do this. I'm mostly interested in what you think the ideal input to this class/function would be. Would you want a Battle object with only the known information, or would you like the framework to find all likely battles?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/553185856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/553587054","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/17#issuecomment-553587054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/17","id":553587054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzU4NzA1NA==","user":{"login":"alexayalamcs","id":9994551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTQ1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9994551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs","html_url":"https://github.com/alexayalamcs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T20:27:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T20:27:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This idea mostly takes inspiration from the [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) project. Note that OpenAI gym is specific to creating environments for reinforcement learning, so not all aspects will apply to this project.\r\n\r\nI'll call this proposed class \"Bot\" for now. At its core, it will have functions that interact with the Battle object to get any necessary information on the current state. These functions may be whatever that assists in developing a bot. There will be a few functions that are expected to be overridden, say **get_move**, **get_switch**, and **get_action**. **get_action** would be if a move or switch should be performed.\r\n\r\nAny decision logic should be in its own class and extend this new Bot class. It will be expected to override the methods functions and implement its own decision logic.\r\n\r\nSo for the two listed decision methods, each one will be made into its own class using Bot as a superclass. We would also need to rework the configuration logic to load the specific class instead. The rest of the code should assume it's working with a Bot class. \r\n\r\nThe result would allow for any new bot developers to easily add their bot to this project. They would need to create a new class, extend Bot, and implement their decision logic; then it's ready to go.
