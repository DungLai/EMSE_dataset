If the sample teams work, the problem you are most likely encountering is what pmariglia said. I'm assuming you're trying to do this on Heroku? From what I understand, when you click on the \"Deploy to Heroku\" button, it basically creates a clone of the repository. When you go and add something to the original repository, it isn't linked with your Heroku project, so you basically did nothing. You can try the fix I posted in #99. Hope this helps!\r\n\r\nEdit: in #100, make sure to scroll down and read what my other account said; the first one I posted with this account doesn't fix the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/1079747754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hypersonicstormm","id":87400978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NDAwOTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87400978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm","html_url":"https://github.com/hypersonicstormm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hypersonicstormm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/1089522604","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/101#issuecomment-1089522604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/101","id":1089522604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpNhO85A8Mus","user":{"login":"dittomaster4444","id":102890060,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiH6TA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102890060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444","html_url":"https://github.com/dittomaster4444","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dittomaster4444/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-05T23:32:59Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T23:32:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
