I have tested the `safest` and the `nash_equilibrium` bots against the OU ladder for thousands of games each - the result is that the `safest` performs the best, with an average of ~1450 ELO right now. There are some nuances, for example the team being used will affect how well the bot performs.\r\n\r\nI do not maintain a board that tracks the performance of each bot, but it is an interesting idea!\r\n\r\nOr were you referring to work done by other people? I have looked at a few:\r\n- https://github.com/Synedh/showdown-battle-bot\r\n- https://github.com/vasumv/pokemon_ai\r\n- https://bitbucket.org/davidstone/technical-machine/src/master/\r\n- https://github.com/yuzeh/metagrok\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with the performance of these bots on the ladder, you would have to ask the authors. Most of these other bots seems to be discontinued though and may not work with Gen8.\r\n\r\nThere is also a project you might find interesting that creates a Pokemon AI battle-arena . I am not sure if this has been discontinued either:\r\n- https://github.com/dramamine/leftovers-again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/609089407/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/609095467","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/32#issuecomment-609095467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/32","id":609095467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTA5NTQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"arochettesteinberg","id":12499557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk5NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12499557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg","html_url":"https://github.com/arochettesteinberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arochettesteinberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-04T22:07:16Z","updated_at":"2020-04-04T22:07:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the quick reply and the links!\r\nYes I am referring to a world ranking board for all the battle bots, likey they do for chess engines for instance.
