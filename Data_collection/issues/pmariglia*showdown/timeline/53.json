The exponential growth hurts much more than you may realize.\r\n\r\nJust to give an idea of the amount of operations required for each search depth. Let's assume 4 moves and 5 switches per player, 9 decisions total. This means 81 \"transpositions\" to calculate (alpha-beta pruning exists and reduces this - but lets just use this as an example) Let's also assume each transposition takes 0.0001s to calculate each.\r\n\r\n| Search Depth | Number of Transpositions | Total Time (seconds) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 1 | 81^1 = **81**  | 81 * 0.0001 = **0.0081**  |\r\n| 2 | 81^2 = **6561**  | 6561 * 0.0001 = **0.6561**  |\r\n| 3 | 81^3 = **531441**  | 531441 * 0.0001 = **53.1441**  |\r\n\r\nAs for this:\r\n> If not, perhaps the bot could detect when the timer is close to running out and reduce search depth at that point?\r\n\r\nTo use minimax properly, the entire calculation from 2 -> 3 needs to be done. So it could calculate for up to say ~10 seconds, but it wouldn't have enough information to make a better decision that if it just stopped at search depth=2. A monte-carlo-tree-search style algorithm would benefit from calculating in this way.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I have good reason to believe that adding an additional search depth would not seriously improve the performance of the minimax bot. I ran the minimax bots head-to-head, one searching to a depth of 2, the other searching to a depth of 3 for about 500 `gen8randombattle` games. It took a very long time, and in the end they were roughly equal in the number of wins.\r\n\r\nI think to make a better Pokemon bot, a different algorithm entirely must be used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/751394834/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/751399725","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/53#issuecomment-751399725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/53","id":751399725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTM5OTcyNQ==","user":{"login":"rahidz","id":22056619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDU2NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22056619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz","html_url":"https://github.com/rahidz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-26T21:52:16Z","updated_at":"2020-12-26T21:52:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah, makes sense.
