The bot needs the current name of the room in order to send messages, and it won't parse the following battle log in order to add the random characters to the end of the room:\r\n```\r\n>battle-gen8randombattle-1372565845\r\n|noinit|rename|battle-gen8randombattle-1372565845-qddmfz5d31w306mbl6odghadmmvzpyjpw\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould be a simple fix - just need to write some battle-log parsing to update the name of the room when it sees a message like this.
