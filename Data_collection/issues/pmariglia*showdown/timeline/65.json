It's labelled \"experimental\" because I know how bad it is. Ladder performance is much better with the `safest` battle-bot, even though that one sucks as well.\r\n\r\nFor completeness: What the bot does is calculate a payoff matrix for what it thinks the game state is for a search depth of 2 (no alpha-beta pruning). This gives an NxM matrix of payoffs where the rows represent the bot's choices and the columns represent what the bot thinks the opponent's choices are. Something like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25304649/117556315-66d62e80-b035-11eb-85ad-4b00020f6ba2.png)\r\n\r\nThen a Nash-Equilibrium is calculated from that payoff matrix.\r\n\r\nThere are so many things wrong with this, a couple are:\r\n\r\n1. This is not the right way to model the payoff matrix for a game with incomplete information like competitive Pokemon.\r\n2. Only searching to a depth of 2 doesn't give the bot an understanding of the long-term strategies and win-conditions. This is a problem with using a search-based method as well: Pokemon is more complicated than just looking a few turns ahead.\r\n\r\n.. and probably other game theory concepts that I am not even aware of.\r\n\r\nThis was really just an experiment I did to get a battle-bot that used a non-deterministic decision method. It was never meant to be the very best like no one ever was.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/835578582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/comments/835691652","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/issues/65#issuecomment-835691652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/65","id":835691652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTY5MTY1Mg==","user":{"login":"timothychen04","id":83555120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTU1MTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83555120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04","html_url":"https://github.com/timothychen04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothychen04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-09T05:25:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-09T05:25:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
