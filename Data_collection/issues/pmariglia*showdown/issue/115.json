Really nice project, found it when searching for something to run bot v bot battles in a team optimisation setting.\r\n\r\nTo that effect, I was wondering if you intended for the simulator code to run full battles? It seems from my initial scan that the code was only inteded to be used alongside the official PS battle system as a guide for the bot itself.\r\n\r\nThis would be pretty nice for my use case (mass-simulaton of battles in the context of genetic algorithms), so if this doesn't exist and you see a roadmap for that feature, I'd be happy to help with the implementation.\r\n\r\n(also just a side query -- do you have any strong limitations for py36 being your only supported version? happy to investigate if otherwise to port to more modern versions since py36 is officially deprecated by numpy etc.)","closed_by":{"login":"pmariglia","id":25304649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzA0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25304649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia","html_url":"https://github.com/pmariglia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmariglia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
