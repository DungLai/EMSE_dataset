This means that if both Pokemon select a same-priority move but the opponent (being faster) knocks out the bot's pokemon before the bot's pokemon gets a chance to move, then the check is stopped when in reality there is enough information to infer a choicescarf from the turn. \r\n\r\nChecking for exactly 2 moves was done so that if either side decided to switch, this check wouldn't be done.\r\n\r\nHere is an example test that will need to be included in a commit fixing this. It should be put in [this test class](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/8c83aa68e145a3f8c8ff264fefe8c0024a20f526/tests/test_battle_modifiers.py#L1962)\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def test_guess_choicescarf_when_opponent_knocks_out_the_bots_pokemon(self):\r\n        self.battle.user.active.stats[constants.SPEED] = 210  # opponent's speed should not be greater than 207 (max speed caterpie)\r\n\r\n        messages = [\r\n            '|move|p2a: Caterpie|Tackle|',\r\n            '|-damage|p1a: Caterpie|0 fnt',\r\n            '|faint|p1a: Caterpie',\r\n            '|',\r\n            '|upkeep',\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n        check_choicescarf(self.battle, messages)\r\n\r\n        self.assertEqual('choicescarf', self.battle.opponent.active.item)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**There are undoubtedly more edge-cases to test - this is just one example.
