I suggest we rework this logic to allow a superclass to be defined which handles all decision logic.\r\n\r\nThis superclass **should not** handle modifying or determining what's allowed in our current state. Ideally, it's only given information and constraints on our current state. Each turn, the superclass will be asked to make a decision based on whatever criteria.\r\n\r\nThis extension will allow this project to be used with other methods of selecting the best move. In particular, I'm interested in extending this project using Reinforcement Learning but this is difficult without some rework of the current code. I will be willing to work on this rework myself, but I need information on the classes I should touch as well as the structure that is preferred for this project. I want to make sure this feature is implemented in a way where it's aligned with the project's goal.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alexayalamcs","id":9994551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTQ1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9994551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs","html_url":"https://github.com/alexayalamcs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexayalamcs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/17/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
