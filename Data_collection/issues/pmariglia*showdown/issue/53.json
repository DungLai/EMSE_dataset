I might be wrong, but this feels like a bug to me, even if the increase in time is exponential per search depth, going from 0-2 seconds per move to 100+ seconds seems excessive. If not, perhaps the bot could detect when the timer is close to running out and reduce search depth at that point?\r\n\r\nThis occurs regardless of battle_bot mode, and regardless of whether I run locally or on Docker.","closed_by":{"login":"rahidz","id":22056619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDU2NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22056619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz","html_url":"https://github.com/rahidz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahidz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pmariglia/showdown/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
