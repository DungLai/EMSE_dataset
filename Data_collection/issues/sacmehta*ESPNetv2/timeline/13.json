Also, you compute class imbalance weights if your dataset is imbalanced. Please see loadData.py file for more details. It is pretty simple and accepts two text files: one for training and one for validation. You can create these files easily as these contains mapping between RGB image and Segmentation mask (ground truth) in comma separated form. Note that one line per image pair.\r\n\r\nii) Training: One you are done with this part i), you can start training your model on your dataset. You need to adjust the number of classes in the main.py file. Please see main.py file for more details. It should be straight forward.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you are still encountering any issues.
