We are about to release a new repository that supports several datasets (MS-COCO, ImageNet, PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes) across three different tasks (single/multi-label classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation). New repository includes better and fast training policies + scripts to set-up the datasets, including downloading and pre-processing. This repo should be out sometime next week.\r\n\r\nI request you to wait for couple more days. \r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/comments/497998152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2383005915,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM4MzAwNTkxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/events/2383005915","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-02T04:29:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
