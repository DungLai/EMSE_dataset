We have fixed this in our new code base, which will be released soon.\r\n\r\n2) Input width and height should be divisible by 16 for ESPNetv2. If they are not, then you will get this error.\r\n\r\n3) Model weights are saved with DataParallel wrapper. If you try to initialize the model without dataparallel wrapper using the pretrained weights, then you will get this error. Try wrapping model with Dataparallel wrapper and the load the pretrained weights. It should work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/comments/483946470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2304707777,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMwNDcwNzc3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/events/2304707777","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-27T12:08:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
