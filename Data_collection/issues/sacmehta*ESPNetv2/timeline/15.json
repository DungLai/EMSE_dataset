But to some extend, there is no a proper explanation for that. In PSPNet, a weighted auxiliary  loss which is set to be 0.4 is added to the training procedure and in BiSeNet two more auxiliary losses(their weight are both set to 1) are added to optimize the whole model.  So you may see many excellent models use this training strategy while how do we understand it.\r\n\r\nIt should have some benefits at least:\r\n1. Increase gradient. Gradient,in general,gradually guides our model to step into optimal.But in this case, if we add one more loss for training the model will get a gradient almost twice as large as the original one which seems to be more helpful for model to learn. After a long time for learning, performance of model will be stable and you will surprisingly find that loss here is also almost twice as large as the original one. Haha, that's may be or not be true but what you need to think is a better model will get better performance which comes mainly from the representation capacity not from more and more losses I think.\r\n2. More context information or gather more information??   I'm not very clear about that.But I suggest that we need compare more cases about this issue. And here I list some experiment to help understand.\r\n    1. Firstly, train the model with only loss( we can view this as baseline)\r\n    2. Train the model with two or more losses jointly( Jointly train the model )\r\n    3. Pre-train model with part model and then add it to the whole model to train( to verify whether the \r\n        auxiliary loss help performance ) \r\n    4. ···( you can image any comparable experiment here )\r\nSo what I want to say is when you add one more loss to your model ,you may face a Collaborative Optimization question. \r\n\r\nI'm also a learner of DL and focus on semantic segmentation. Here, I agree with @sacmehta you need give a try about your questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/comments/479868238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lqxisok","id":16935233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTM1MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16935233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok","html_url":"https://github.com/lqxisok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqxisok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2252687302,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI1MjY4NzMwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/events/2252687302","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-04T12:00:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2252687303,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNTI2ODczMDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/events/2252687303","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-04T12:00:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2252687304,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI1MjY4NzMwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/events/2252687304","actor":{"login":"jongmokim7","id":48193396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTkzMzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48193396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7","html_url":"https://github.com/jongmokim7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongmokim7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-04T12:00:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2252687305,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNTI2ODczMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/events/2252687305","actor":{"login":"jongmokim7","id":48193396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTkzMzk2","avatar_ur
