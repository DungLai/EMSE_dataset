If a similar search is done using EESP module, I believe that will give better performance.\r\n\r\nP.S: Searching over 8K design choices, MNAsNet delivers slightly better performance to our work (73 top-1 with 3.6 M params and 270 M FLOps) while our unit delivers 72.1 under similar budget.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/comments/444469526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2011546386,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjAxMTU0NjM4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/events/2011546386","actor":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-07T04:11:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
