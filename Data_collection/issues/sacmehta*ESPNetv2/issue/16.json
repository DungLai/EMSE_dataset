I did some modifications to code so it works for my 10 classes. Input image size was 640x480 I got an mIoU of 62% on validation which is really good. However I was expecting a greater performance but I got 52 fps as inference speed which is average of all samples[5:]. I wanted to know why there is a huge difference in performance claimed by paper(140 fps) and implementation(50fps) ?... this is how ran the code \r\npython main.py --batch_size 10 --s 1.0 --inWidth 640  --inHeight 480 --max_epochs 350 --batch_size 32 --classes 10 --csvfile ~/data/Cityscape_v2/class_dict_grouped.csv --data_dir `pwd` \r\nthe last parameter I have added to train for my dataset.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sacmehta","id":18603245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAzMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18603245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta","html_url":"https://github.com/sacmehta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sacmehta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
