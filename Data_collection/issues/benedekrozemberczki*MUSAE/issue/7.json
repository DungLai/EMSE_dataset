FacebookPagePage dataset\r\n    - I want to reduce its dimension from 128 to 64.\r\n    - So can I get the raw text which you used?\r\n    - I saw your recommendation on [issue3](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE/issues/3). Can I do dimensionality reduction on this dataset, too?\r\n\r\n2. Twitch datasets\r\n    - I want to reduce these too.\r\n    - The paper mentions, \"Node features are games liked, location and streaming habits.\"\r\n    - So I think simple dimensionality reduction on this dataset might be harmful.\r\n    - How can I handle these?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
