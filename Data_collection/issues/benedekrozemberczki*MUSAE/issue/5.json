There are several files like this one in the repository.\r\n\r\nThere are several columns in this file, including \"id\", \"days\", \"mature\", \"view\", \"partner\", and \"new_id\". I am curious about which column indicates the label of a node, that is, whether a streamer uses explicit language.\r\n\r\nCould you give me a hint about this? Many thanks!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSimon","closed_by":{"login":"brave-simon","id":45119452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTE5NDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45119452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon","html_url":"https://github.com/brave-simon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brave-simon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
