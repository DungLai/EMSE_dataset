I have a question about the definition of actions in the manual control script vs the definition of actions in the RL training script. I hope to be able to use the \"learned\" policy, with defined actions --> and be able to visualize the policy learned in a \"agent\" point of view like the manual control script. \r\n\r\nFor this purpose (I don't know if this is a particularly dumb solution, or if there is a more miraculous and easier solution), but I imagined I would feed the actions from the trained policy --> into the manual control script, but the problem is that the actions from the RL script are integers [0], [1], [2] in the Hallway problem. How do these correspond to actions like move_forward, move_left etc.? What is the mapping?  \r\n\r\nThank you very much for the kind help!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56416888/79094150-90366500-7d24-11ea-856f-77b4c13eeef7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56416888/79094186-b0feba80-7d24-11ea-89b1-cff4e312d9e3.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
