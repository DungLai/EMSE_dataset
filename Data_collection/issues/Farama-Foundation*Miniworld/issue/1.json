Many people would like to have a top-down-view/map where the agent's position is visible. This view would be fully observable.\r\n\r\nCould be implemented as a method on environments, eg `get_top_view()` that returns a numpy RGB array.  Once this is implemented, we will also want to update the human view produced by `env.render('human')` to always show the top-down view on the side, in addition to the first-person view.\r\n\r\nWe will most likely want the resolution of the top view to be configurable in the environment's constructor. However, the small top view produced for the human render will necessarily be smaller. As a result, we will probably want to render these separately, in two separate frame buffers.","closed_by":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
