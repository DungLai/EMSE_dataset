I would like to have an API for domain randomization that is a bit more principled, less ad-hoc than what's in `gym-duckietown`.\r\n\r\nWe probably want a class `DomainParams`, which stores a list of parameters that can be sampled. Each parameter should have a unique name, as well as `min`, `max` and `default` values, with the `default` value being assigned when domain randomization is turned off. Values will also have types/shapes (eg: `int`, `float`, `rgb_color`, `vector`). This system will allow someone to instantiate simulator and easily control the range of randomized values if they want to.\r\n\r\nIt might be useful to have a mechanism to sample all values at once, eg:\r\n\r\n`vals = params.sample(rng)`\r\n\r\nHowever, it may also be useful to be able to sample a subset of the parameters, possibly by specifying the names of all values to be sampled:\r\n\r\n`vals = params.sample(rng, ['cam_height', 'cam_angle'])`\r\n\r\nThe use case for this is that there will be various objects/entities in the world, and we may want to randomize various parameters for each object independently.\r\n\r\n@liampaull @bhairavmehta95","closed_by":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
