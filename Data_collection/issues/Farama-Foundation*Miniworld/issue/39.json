I notice there is a function in miniworld.py called render_obs(). In the function, there is a method called         \r\ngluLookAt(\r\n            # Eye position\r\n            *self.agent.cam_pos,\r\n            # Target\r\n            *(self.agent.cam_pos + self.agent.cam_dir),\r\n            # Up vector\r\n            0, 1.0, 0.0\r\n        )\r\nI try to modify the self.agent.cam_dir. However, it seems only modify cam_dir can not get a 360 view. I have the following thoughts:\r\n1. Turning the agent 360 and capture the observations.\r\n2. Place 4 cameras on the agent\r\n3. Changing the camera yaw of the current agent\r\nCould you please tell me which is doable in this repo? If nothing works, could you give me any suggestions?\r\n\r\nBest,","closed_by":{"login":"cgxuvector","id":44514998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE0OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44514998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector","html_url":"https://github.com/cgxuvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
