I am happy to see simple and customizable domains like this. I have the following questions:\r\n1. It seems the maze env is created by creating #(row x col) rooms and then they are connected using the backtracking algorithm. Is it possible to generate the maze from a txt file similar to deepmind lab? If not, could u please give me some hints of how to change it?\r\n2. I still wonder if there is a way to retrieve the depth image. However, when I read the code in miniworld.py and maze.py. It seems the current version only provides RGB images. Could u please tell me how to obtain a depth image?  (I resolve this question thanks.)\r\nBest,","closed_by":{"login":"cgxuvector","id":44514998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE0OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44514998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector","html_url":"https://github.com/cgxuvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
