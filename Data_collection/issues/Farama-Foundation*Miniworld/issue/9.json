Fortunately, it seems like the [original NIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19\r\n) (what MNIST is based on) is public domain, and includes PNG images of characters.\r\n\r\nWe could use MiniWorld's built-in texture randomization to randomly pick among digit and character textures. We could also use OpenGL tricks to randomize the color/background when rendering the TextFrame entities. Each entity has a `randomize` method which allows it to pick domain randomization parameters.","closed_by":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
