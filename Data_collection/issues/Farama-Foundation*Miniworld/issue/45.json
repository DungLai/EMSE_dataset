In particular, given a front-view depth image I, I am trying to use it to reconstruct the 3D positions of each pixel on the image. A common solution is to use the camera intrinsic matrix and extrinsic matrix. \r\n\r\nCould you please give me any suggestions about where I can find those matrices or how to do the projection in a more simple way?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cgxuvector","id":44514998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE0OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44514998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector","html_url":"https://github.com/cgxuvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgxuvector/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
