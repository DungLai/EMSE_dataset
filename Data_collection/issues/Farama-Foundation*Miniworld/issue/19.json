I've been looking at different projects on the web, mostly for fun and to learn something new.\r\n\r\nI love your gym-miniworld project b/c I can see its progress (cones, wall, sidewalk, a building in the distance, etc.)\r\n\r\nPlease see the screenshot.  Does \"success rate\" > 0 mean it's touched the block?  I've been running gym-miniworld all night, and I've seen a success rate of 0.01 or 0.02 only a few times.\r\n\r\nBecause of its low success rate, I don't know if I did something wrong, or if I should be more patient.  What should I expect?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nEdit: I entered this command to start:\r\n```bash\r\nadministrator@ubuntu:~/Desktop/gym-miniworld/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr$` python3 main.py --algo ppo --num-frames 5000000 --num-processes 16 --num-steps 80 --lr 0.00005 --env-name MiniWorld-Sidewalk-v0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n![miniworld-ss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13643084/73073422-ea89fd00-3e7c-11ea-9422-aaa625e1c421.jpg)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wmeitzen","id":13643084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13643084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen","html_url":"https://github.com/wmeitzen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmeitzen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
