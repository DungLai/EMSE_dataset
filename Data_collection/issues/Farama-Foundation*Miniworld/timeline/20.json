Thanks for reporting this issue.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately can't replicate this bug on Linux. If I had to guess, I think it might have something to do with the way files are handled (different line terminators on Windows maybe?). I don't have Windows here so I can't debug this issue easily. Could you help me track down the problem?\r\n\r\nI suspect that no faces are loaded. I would suggest putting a print statement on line 101 to log it when a face gets parsed:\r\nhttps://github.com/maximecb/gym-miniworld/blob/master/gym_miniworld/objmesh.py#L101\r\n\r\nYou could also put a print statement on line 76 to print out the tokens for each line, to see if we can spot what's wrong: https://github.com/maximecb/gym-miniworld/blob/master/gym_miniworld/objmesh.py#L76\r\n\r\nCan you do that and report what gets printed? Your help is much appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/comments/582135700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3007862736,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAwNzg2MjczNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/events/3007862736","actor":{"login":"TexMex657","id":13320920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzIwOTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13320920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657","html_url":"https://github.com/TexMex657","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-04T21:58:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3007862740,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMDc4NjI3NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/events/3007862740","actor":{"login":"TexMex657","id":13320920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzIwOTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13320920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657","html_url":"https://github.com/TexMex657","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TexMex657/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-04T21:58:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/comments/583878616","html_url":"https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/20#issuecomment-583878616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld/issues/20","id":583878616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Mzg3ODYxNg==","user":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-09T18:42:23Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T18:42:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@TexMex657
